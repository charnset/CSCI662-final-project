1,i was very disappointed with the hotel this time they seem to be coming down in quality quite a bit the clientele also seem to be of a lower quality the lobby was quite a rambunctious scene with no one on staff seeming to notice the house keeper only did the bare minimum in the room each day and did not replace the used toiletries or the coffee she also left the dirty coffee cups in the room i think i will have to stay with the intercontinental next time
0,the hard rock should stick to restaurants after a recent stay at the hard rock hotel in chicago i think they should go back to what there good at besides having to wait an hour for my room to be ready this is after my check in time the receptionist was very rude and seemed to not care that i was being delayed after seeing the state the room was in i still do not understand what took so long the sheets look to have been picked up off the floor and returned to the bed the bathroom looked as if somebody had just used it i will leave out the details complaining didn t seem to get me anywhere they offered me a small discount at the hotel s bar after this experience i will be more likely to book at a motel then return to the hard rock
2,i have to thank the ambassador east hotel for providing a really great experience for my family we never leave our dog at home when we travel and it s been a long time since we ve been able to find a place of this caliber that allows pets the staff even spent time cooing over how cute our dog is when we asked about local clothing boutiques my husband liked the fitness room it was nice and clean with plenty of extra towels available it was colder than we expected with the wind blowing in off the water but the concierge knew exactly where we should go for jackets and scarves we will definitely be staying here next time we visit chicago we would make the trip just to stay here that s how welcome we felt when we stayed at this hotel
0,i just returned from a long weekend in chicago with my wife we stayed at the affinia hotel and i can t even begin to describe what an awful experience it was when we arrived at on thursday check in is our room was not ready we had to wait til almost before we could even get into the room once inside the room smelled like an ash tray obviously someone had deactivated the smoke detectors somehow and had been smoking in the room we decided to just go out for an early dinner after arriving back to our room around our key didn t work we had to go all the way back down to the lobby to get a new one the next morning the maids started knocking on our door at in the morning why would you try to clean the room that early the do not disturb sign was on our door for the rest of the stay after that early wakeup we went downstairs to request a different room due to the terrible smell in the one we were assigned the front desk employee gave me a very condescending look and sighed when i asked eventually we did get a new room but i didn t enjoy the demeanor i encountered to do so our new room was fairly nice and the rest of the stay was relatively uneventful but i have a bad taste in my mouth and likely won t stay there again
1,i was surprised by the fact that there were no extra sheets or blankets to make up the hide a bed i called the desk and asked for some and they said that i couldn t have any and that only the maid could come and set up the bed my husband was ill and i wanted the bed set up so i wouldn t disturb him but they were un moved and wouldn t bring the sheets i ended up sleeping on the mattress with bath towels over it and another bath towel as a blanket they could have given me a set of sheets and a blanket i didn t pay that much a night to sleep on a bare mattress seriously lack of concern for the customer
0,i had wanted to stay in this hotel since i had heard about how historic it is and i was highly disappointed with my stay there the room that i was given was dirty and when i went back to the front desk to inquire about it they disregarded my concerns it took them a very long time to get me a new room and they whole time they were very unprofessional and did not make me feel welcome i did not stay in the hotel all night since the people in the rooms around mine were unruly and were making noises all night long i left that night but not before demanding a refund
3,my wife and i stayed here in the middle of february we took the el subway to the hotel from o hare it was very convenient the lobby was nice and the room was clean and comfortable i ve stayed in many a hotel room this bed was the most comfortable i ve ever slept in the hotel is located in a great area and close to everything walking distance to almost all the interesting sites chicago has would definetly recommend this hotel to anyone visiting this great city
3,i stayed here august through with my sixteen year old son and we thoroughly enjoyed this hotel the price was very reasonable for a hotel located right on michigan avenue the front desk and concierge service was excellent and enhanced our stay by making it easy for us to plan fun activities the john entwistle theme on our floor was a nice touch any of you single fathers out there can appreciate how difficult it can be to take a fun affordable vacation with your children and the hard rock hotel in chicago really helped me accomplish just that
0,a few weeks ago we stayed at the hard rock hotel in chicago the hotel was a bust from the get go as we arrived in the lobby we had to wait several minutes for the front desk clerk to show up we could hear her talking in the back for minutes when she got to the desk she was very short with us and not very helpful we had to wander around the halls looking for our room once we got to our room we thought the weekend was going to get better the rooms are modern and nicely designed that was about all that this hotel had going for it though as soon as we started to explore the room more it was clear this room had been a haven for a party a few nights before the bathroom smelled of vomit and the bath tub had small shards or glass from broken bottles in it we called a worker and they cleaned most of it up but the thought of it still remained as we all settled down to sleep there were a few loud noises coming from the room next door after about an hour we finally made a call to the front desk to complain the woman said that a rock band was in that room and they had just finished a show in chicago they were staying there the next nights i wouldn t recommend this hotel to anyone it s a hard rock hotel all right at least that s what the beds feel like
2,the rooms were beautiful the staff was friendly and helpful i love where the conrad in chicago was located it seemed to be close to a lot of places i wanted to visit chicago was great and the conrad hotel made my family and my stay that much more exceptional
0,i had such a horrible experience when i stayed at omni chicago hotel last saturday night first of all the plasma tv in my room was broken and the staff said they had no other rooms available and they weren t particularly apologetic about it either secondly it was supposedly a non smoking hotel but as an ex smoker i can tell that people had smoked in the room recently additionally the indoor swimming pool was closed due to high chlorine levels which was really disappointing because i was looking forward to using the pool finally check out was supposed to be at noon at am the maid was knocking at the door she asked if i would be out soon and i thought was very quite intrusive i will never ever stay at that place again
3,excellent location about a block from michigan ave and two blocks from water tower place and john hancock tower beautiful hotel felt very luxurious and high class for being a moderate priced hotel staff was excellent friendly and accommodating
1,the heating in our room didn t work and wasn t repaired depite numerous requests the rooms were very small the litter in the bin remained in the bin for the whole stay the cleaner made the bed but nothing else when we returned home my credit card statement showed that the hotel had charged me for the night stay despite my having pre paid through a travel agent it took the hotel months to re credit my card without an apology or offer to pay for my numerous trans atlantic phone calls to them
2,the fairmont chicago millenium park hotel provides a rich beautiful cultured atmosphere during my stay i felt like royalty with unparalleled design schemes and beautiful tranquil views the mood during my entire stay was one of bliss the guest services department was second to none the staff throughout the hotel were obviously concerned with pleasing the customer and making my stay as wonderful as possible when dealing with a staff member at fairmont i felt as if i were the only guest in the place the food and drink selections were vast and fit for a king i will definitely recommend fairmont chicago millenium park to my friends and colleagues i will also greatly look forward to my next stay
2,a hotel made for royalty decked out to the top with luxuries you could only dream of it is an amazing experience it s located right in the middle of everything in chicago and pulls in all the best attributes of the city into one fun filled experience the customer service was fantastic as they were very responsive and polite to my requests and fixed any complaints without a complaint of their own a beautiful experience that i would certainly do again
0,the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel was supposed to be our romantic get away and it turned into a nightmare when we got there our room wasn t done we were not offered anything to do drink or eat in the meantime and we had to wait well over the minutes that they said it would be finished the clerk at the front desk twas texting on her cell phone how rude we were totally on time and the manager said that they would take care of the issue and upgrade our room but it was not done and after waiting that long for the room can you believe it there was a dirty towel in the bathroom the television didn t work we had to wait on a repair guy to fix it plus the hotel failed to mention there was a convention that was going on and the spa was under repair i m so mad i m writing the owners and letting them know this really made me mad we haven t taken a vacation in years and i was expecting the fairmont to be luxurious and cater to our needs even the concierge snickered at my boots so what i like to wear doc martens it makes me mad even thinking about the fairmont at least my time in chicago was enjoyable even though our hotel was more than lame
1,stayed at the fitzpatrick before about years ago it was ok the management was great staff was so kind and rooms were clean but this time i promised my self never to go back the new staff was so rude i made a reservation for my anniversary on the internet and the day of check in i was told by the hotel staff that they do not have my reservation i was transferred around back and forth from the hotel staff to the reservations hotline staff was extremely rude not arrogant but rude like they hated thier job they offered check in at but the room wasn t ready till there were stains everywhere because of the high sales of rooms due to popularity on this site they must have hired a cheap unfriendly staff
1,after reading good reviews about i booked a night stay checked in late bit called early in the day to assure we d have a roll away as well as the pull out sofa for teens they somehow had us booked for two rooms instead got that sorted out and arrived around pm checked in and waited for our luggage finally went down and got it ourselves the room was a little grungy furniture shabby and discovered a suspicious stain on the duvet cover ewww called for a new duvet cover which was delivered and unceremoniously handed to me fyi it s kinda gross to have to change the duvet cover in a hotel next day tried to iron a dress for dinner and the iron didn t work called for a replacement waited a while called again and was brought another iron which also didn t work third time was a charm oh boy too bad we paid in advance won t be staying here again
2,i stayed at the millennium knickerbocker hotel for a total of three days and through out my stay i had a wonderful time the room was impeccably clean as well as the pillows and sheets the beds were large and extremely comfortable the staff though in my honest opinion is what made my stay so pleasant from the people at the check in to the waiters at the restaurant i got the best customer service the hotel was also conveniently located it was within walking distance to the shopping center i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone staying at around the area in chicago
2,this hotel is great i love its interior design of the room customer service is excellent and its gym and spa are gorgeous if you need to go to chicago this hotel would be your best choice you can also check its website for the special offer i found a great deal on it
3,i recently stayed at this hotel with my family we had a terrific experience i landed the hotel through priceline for per night and paid an additional per night for a suite on the floor my two young boys loved it as the view was unbelieveable and the pool on the floor was easily accessible i found all the employees that we interfaced with to be very friendly and accommodating i would love to stay here again
2,i recently stayed at the hyatt regency in downtown chicago my stay here was wonderful thanks to such a friendly staff i needed to do some research for work and the free wi fi made this very easy the bed was so nice and soft even the pillows were fluffy i was able to put my valuables in the in room safe the local restaurants were amazing i will recommend this to my friends and i am staying here again in the future
0,what a terrible experience my family and i had at affinia chicago first of all we reserved a room with queen size beds and received only king size bed with a cot when we got to the room we found hair balls on the floor as if a cat had previously stayed there what an absolute terror affinia was and i will never be going back
1,where do i start the gm was a nice guy for handling the incident i had anthony the concierge set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice he set me up and quoted me a price of when i got to the spa which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was with off at the end of the massage i gave the lady and said thanks you can keep the change she insisted that i got a hotel rate because anthony set me up she called anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay anthony the difference she then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which i declined in short shady dealings with this place i was quite taken back the gm selman comp d me a night but i felt swindled big time stay somewhere else the concierge has something going on
2,the homewood suites is one of my favorite hotels in chicago it is a great place to stay as a family the last time my family and i visited chicago we stayed and picked the shedd aquarium package what an amazing time the aquarium is great and we saved a lot of money by buying this package i also appreciated that fact that our room had a kitchen with two really picky children it was so nice to be able to cook or at least to have the option we also enjoyed the many neat facilities in the homewood suites chicago downtown nice pool great workout room breakfast buffet and the wine and beer dinner in the evening i wouldn t stay anywhere else when i visit the windy city
2,i just got back from the monaco in chicago i was very pleasantly surprised as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway and he usually picks bad places haha anyway the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated it was busy and the line was a little long but it moved quickly the lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good especially since it seemed to be near full the room was clean and spacious especially considering it s a city hotel we made a lot of use of the concierge since again it was so last minute we didn t really make any plans he gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for chicago pizza yummy it was also great being near the theater district and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare i thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room very trendy my husband is not as easily impressed but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon overall really nice stay in a four star or probably four and half star hotel
0,last week i booked a deluxe suite at the omni chicago hotel for a weekend stay in chicago i took the retreat and relax package deal the wait to check in was intolerably long because they were letting some people check in with a dog i m allergic to dogs and i m sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in they insisted on escorting me to to my room every time i came in like i was going to break into another guest s room or something i swear anytime i was out of my room they were watching me like hawks asking me if i needed anything you know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you re up to something i went to the pool but it was full of screaming children when i went to bed i could hear the television in the next room through my wall and what s worse they wouldn t even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress they threatened to throw me out on the street after i gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars i had to go outside probably where the dog went to piddle to do it also their on site restaurant is too expensive given that you re already paying an arm and a leg for the room the food should be free i wouldn t stay here again it was a waste of my money
2,beautiful views and awesome service my husband and i stayed at the swissotel in chicago while meeting up with some old friends from college we have been to chicago a few times but never stayed at this hotel before first off the architecture and feel of the hotel is just amazing so beautiful the views from our corner suite was breathtaking and the accomodations were flawless the fact that we could have an apartment like setting rather than a cold hotel room made all the difference from the big tub in the bath to the entertainment system and work area everything is in place to make your stay like being at home but with an awesome view of the chicago skyline we took advantage of the executive club for desserts and breakfast and had dinner one night at the palm restaurant delicious food we will definitely stay at the swissotel the next time we visit chicago
3,we got an awesome deal through priceline for a friday sunday stay at for each night the hotel is very centrally located on michigan avenue the magnificent mile you can walk to a ton of shops there are plenty of restaurants handy as well the hotel staff was very friendly and the room itself was gorgeous very modern decor not drab typical like most other chain hotels if staying in chicago we definitely will be staying there again price for valet parking overnight was insane day but what do you expect in a big city
1,the location of this hotel is excellent the hotel itself is not a star like they say in my opinion the room decor is horrible probably more european than i am used to and the room is small and furnished like an old apartment on the upside if you want to stay in a great location feel safe and can put up with some aesthetic issues and can get a great deal then this will work i prefer westin or marriott something that you can count on
1,the hotel is very impressive upon entering and the staff was very friendly however we felt our room was very dated and worn looking our air conditioning didn t seem to be working well but we turned it down and thought that it would eventually cool off our first night was interrupted by a phone call at one a m that was a fax it happened times by this time we realized that the air was not working again so after fussing with the controls it did kick on the next morning i mentioned to the concierge the issues with the phone but didn t think to mention the issues with the air because it appeared to be working after being out seeing the sites of chicago for several hours and being very hot we were looking forward to resting in a cool room before going to a show our room was degrees i called and maintenience did come to check after determining that the unit needed a motor it was another hour so we did not get to rest in a cool room before going out i feel an offer should have been made to us by the hotel also was very surprised that wifi was not a free service we will not be staying at the hilton on our next trip to chicago
0,i recently stayed in a room at the trendy talbott hotel it looked nice on the outside so i decided to them a whirl as soon as i walked in i noticed that there weren t alot of hotel employees usually the large hotel are swarming with service people ready to lend a hand i was tired and i needed a nice room so as i approached the front desk i noticed something odd food was sitting out right in front of the front desk people were talking different items such as bagels and muffins from the left over breakfast rush crumbs everywhere especially where i was suppose to exchange cash and room keys let s just say it wasn t professional the room was average and the bathroom didn t carry the kinds of brands i would have liked to see no wi fi connection and i had to walk down the hall for ice talk about lack of customer service all in all the stay was sub par and nothing special
2,the ambassador east hotel in chicago is a fantastic up scale hotel to stay in while visiting the windy city my fiancee and i enjoyed one of the king rooms on our recent stay the staff was exceptionally friendly and helpful some of the best i ve ever dealt with when traveling and valet parking is always a perk the rooms were very nice and had all the amenities you would want when at a high end hotel the bed was extremely comfortable there was cable tv of course and hbo was included so there was always something to watch wireless internet signal was excellent and i had no trouble getting online we had dinner in the hotel restaurant twice during our stay and the food was fantastic great atmosphere as well we usually only do the hotel restaurant one night on a stay but this one was worth going back to overall it was an incredible stay and we hope to stay at the ambassador east again next time we re in chicago
3,very quaint and romantic yet masculine i ve noticed that at most chicago hotel bars it s hard to get a drink much less a seat but i guess because it s a small hotel that was not a problem at the talbott plus people take their drinks out to the seating in the lobby because it s so inviting cozy and comfortable love that would love to stay again but i must say that i was surprised by all the comments on the comfortable beds ours was too firm also note there is no gym on the premises but walking and shopping is enough of a workout
1,nice big rooms but stinky mildew hallways fair room service menu and weird elevator set up really hurt my review on the omni location was great but there are a lot of other options if you get a really good deal on the room i wouldn t say no
0,this hotel was very poor with customer service they were so worried about keeping everything up to date and perfect looking in the hotel they rarely worried about their customers and their guests i had to ask for my room to be serviced for cleaning and it took a long time to get a response very disappointed
2,this is a beautiful hotel with a great view of the chicago river and a short walk to all the best places to visit in the city i had an unbelievably pleasant and relaxing stay with an in room massage and fantastic room service if you re looking for a vacation in chicago and want to experience the best the city has to offer as well as live in luxury and comfort i highly recommend this hotel and i would definitely come again
0,i had high hopes for the ambassador east hotel i really did it seemed like a nice enough place with reasonably close beach access i arrived to the hotel on a tuesday afternoon i was immediately surprised by the state of disrepair that the building was in i could actually see two members of hotel maintenance in the parking lot sitting in their truck doing nothing as i walked in nobody greeted me and nobody offered to take my bags the hotel furniture looked quaint and outdated with a fine covering of dust i went to the counter to check in and the disinterested girl working barely glanced at my papers and slid me my keys all while avoiding eye contact and typing on the computer i got to my room and despite specifically asking for nonsmoking there was a distinct smell of cigarettes inside and in the hallway having paid extra for an upgraded room i was extremely disappointed by the condition inside the drinking glasses were filthy the towels smelled of mold and there was actually trash that was left in the bathroom trash can the television was a basic crt that looked to be about fifteen years old and there was no channel guide though i suppose i didn t need one for the six channels that it had i had heard good things about the food at the ambassador east hotel but alas there was no respite here the room service that i ordered took forty minutes to arrive and my steak was cold and cooked beyond well done elsewhere in the hotel things were no better everywhere i went from the pool to the bar the staff was hasty rude and completely uninterested and nowhere was particularly clean or well decorated i really wanted to like the ambassador east hotel but unfortunately the best part of my stay was checking out
1,this hotel does not live up to the reviews the room was larger than i expected however the decor was a bit dated the bedding was ripped carpet was stained and the shower door was broken there was a long wait to the elevators and if you re on floors you need to take a second elevator to get to the roof bar and gym the main issue i had was the attitude i received from the staff there was literally only one nice person at the front desk there are no ice machines in this building so you have to request it from the front desk one day i requested it by going down to the desk and asking in person minutes later i made a follow up call because i did not receive my ice i was nastily told that ice takes minutes and i should just wait i finally got the ice minutes later two days later i requested ice again waited minutes and just gave up while i was leaving i mentioned this to the woman at the front desk and she just said i didn t get a call for ice well i obviously wasn t making it up lady i called and spoke with someone she didn t even apologize or offer me anything overall i would not recommend this hotel there are so many hotels in the chicago area choose a different one
2,very beautiful hotel the historic features of this hotel make it absolutely amazing this hotel offers many great guest accommodations of which i enjoyed the spacious tidy rooms the staff here are very friendly helpful and professional the concierge went out of her way to make sure we knew about the area and not just what was in the hotel i especially enjoyed the service at the lockwood restaurant here our server was excellent and the food was delicious i must say this hotel exceeded my expectations all in all my stay was awesome
2,this was the best choice my husband and i could have chosen to visit the hotel has stunning views from all around and the best part is that it is near the water i was perfectly happy to enjoy the luxurious rooms and comfortable decor while my husband enjoyed the solace the found in the free gym everything was so clean and invoting especially the pump room there was so much history in one rooom overall we had a great relaxing vacation away from the kids i would definitely return to the ambassador next time we re in the area
0,my wife and i were excited to visit and shop at chicago s magnificent mile on michigan ave we chose the intercontinental hotel for it s reputation and location man oh man were we disappointed the check in was smooth enough even though the hotel was busy and all seemed well we got ready to go out shopping and went to visit the concierge in the lobby to ask about suggestions and bargains there were six people in line for her and we had to wait that was no problem since we weren t on a timetable when we finally got to her and asked about shopping on the miracle mile she just pointed to the door and said it s right out the door i asked her for suggestions of the best stores for bargains and she rolled her eyes at me saying there s no such thing i couldn t believe her abruptness we left the concierge stand not wanting to return shopping went well and was fun we returned to our room and wanted to look up a restaurant for the night ourselves rather than ask the concierge we couldn t find a hotel directory in the room i called the housekeeping department and was told we re all out of directories here in the office i asked if they could check a vacant room for one she said the hotel was full and there were no vacant rooms i hung up and thought i would just look for a restaurant in the yellow pages guess what you guessed it no phone book in the room i figured we could go get a drink at the bar the hotel s s themed lounge and ask the bartender for suggestions we went to the bar and there were only three other customers we sat at the bar and got our drinks as i was about to ask the bartender for restaurant suggestions his cell phone rang he answered it and went to the other end of the bar to talk twenty minutes later he was still on the phone tired and hungry my wife and i went back to our room and ordered a pizza to be delivered from pizza hut although the hotel is nice enough and the furnishings comfortable the indifference of the staff will keep me from ever coming back a big thumbs down to the intercontinental chicago they need to look up the word hospitality in the dictionary
2,i work for a software marketing firm and that job requires me to travel at least days per year i spend a large amount of time in hotels i normally don t write reviews for hotels but the homewood suites by hilton were above and beyond let s start where it matters the rooms they are top notch there s nothing better than walking in to a clean beautiful rooms after a long day of travel the beds are among the best i ve ever slept in in hotels the rest of the room is just as nice and makes me feel at home the price low i looked for similar rooms in the area at other hotels and everything else was at least more expensive but you don t get what you pay for here you get much more than that the location couldn t be better you want to go to a world class restaurant that s within walking distance you want a great shopping experience again walking distance anything else you want chances are it s within walking distance overall one of the best hotels i ve ever stayed in
0,on a recent stay at the fairmont chicago millemmium park hotel i was appalled at the service i received at such a supposedly high end hotel when i arrived i had to wait in the lobby for minutes before someone came to the front desk to check me in apparently the desk clerk was on a personal phone call with her boyfriend and just had to know where he was going and who he was with finally i was given the key to my non smoking room away from the vending area much to my chagrin my room was right next to the vending area and i heard other guests going back and forth to the ice machine until nearly midnight and the room was obviously a room for smokers the blankets on the bed and the pillows reaked of cigarette smoke i of course complained but was told that was the only room available as they had booked every room for a conference but i was welcome to check out and go to another hotel after a fitfull night s sleep i awoke to children running up and down the hallway their parents were no where in sight my shower was cold and had no pressure i was given two towels one of which had not been laundered i could not wait to check out and informed the manager on duty of my complaints and told him i would not be recommending this hotel to anyone and would go online to write my review so anyone interested would see it i cannot understand how such a highly rated hotel could be so far from the mark
3,we were greeted by staff with excellent customer service skills our room was such a pleasant surprise from the flat screen tv the full size shower with rain showerhead hand held shower wand the wall attached toilet with flushing options on the wall the comfortable bed the lovely lighting options etc the size of the room was snug and very comfortable as would be in a historic hotel it was also quiet and i know that the hotel was sold out my sister was in the room next door we did not hear her tv we also loved walking less than a block to the shopping and restaurants on north michigan avenue
2,this hotel is fantastic i stayed there on my way through chicago towards arizona and could not believe the great quality of the hotel i d have thought i was in a vegas suite really polite staff great housekeeping and amazing prices on my way out i was telling the manager about how much i d loved the hotel and he even offered me an extra night there you can safely say that my trip was delayed roughly hours
1,i have been meaning to write a review of the omni but wasn t sure if people would believe it as most of the reviews are quite high we stayed here for nights the room was fine when i walked in but about five minutes or so i was all congested thought it might have been from the flight i then noticed there was dust everywhere the tv the minibar and worst of all the air vent it was literally hanging off the vent i called down to front desk they said they would send housekeeping up after minutes of waiting and noticing other things a bathroom door that wouldn t close broken light fixtures a toe or fingernail on the bed broken bathroom fixtures this place was a dump hopefully the pictures will show some of it i could go on and on almost minutes later the hotel manager came up to look at the room both he and head of housekeeping were shocked at the room we were moved to another room not as large as this one was because the hotel was completely booked or so i was told i stayed at the omni once prior and have to say was very impressed but this will be the last time sad to say the hotel did cut the rate of our day stay but doesn t explain how a hotel of this caliber let a room like this pass any inspection
1,i made reservations with the chicago fitzpatrick using their number for two nights in june i received no written confirmation with cancelation policy etc however when i attempted to cancel my reservation the morning of my first night s reservation i was told that they would charge me for one nights stay they have a the day before your first nights stay policy even though the hotel was not sold out for the night they would not budge on the policy this is not a common policy on michigan ave i d advise making your reservations someplace that offers more flexiblity for emergencies or sends a written confirmation with policy it was a very expensive mistake on my part to book with this hotel
3,our first visit to chicago and i really cannot wait to go back the hotel was in a great location and every member of staff we had contact with were exceptionally helpful particular mention should go to the door staff who were amazingly helpful the room was clean quiet and spacious if only every hotel were like this
3,my girlfriends and i stayed nights at the talbott returning home on saturday we all had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel the staff from top to bottom were excellent accommodating the room was roomy with our only complaint being not being able to cool the room fast enough after a day on the town the construction next door was obstructing the sidewalk but being on a oneway street limited that difficulty the doorman andrew was an excellent source at this hotel he arranged all our transportation at night to restaurants we enjoyed everything about the hotel and the city the hotel was expensive but met expectations
0,i had originally chosen the conrad chicago hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance however i later learned that i had made a poor choice upon arrival the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk although when we reached out hotel room we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one bedroom suite my family went back down to demand another room with two queen size beds the clerk after a twenty minute waiting period was able to find us a suitable room upon entering the room was noticably hot we turned on the air conditioning and after waiting for thirty minutes the room remained muggy and humid i called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room they promised a repairman within ten minutes hour later i called again and remined them that the repairman hadn t shown up they once again promised a speedy repair while waiting i discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp i called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level but i had to go get them after all this trouble i argued that they should bring it up to me but in the end i wound up going to get it myself after returning to my room and waiting another minutes the repair man had not shown up so i called again and within minutes the repairman came he managed to fix the air conditioner but it was about we were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off but as the night went on we noticed another problem the air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds it also emitted a strange odor upon checking with the front desk we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired there were not available rooms left and being so fed up with this hotel s poor service we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel i don t recommend the conrad chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time
3,we travel to chicago regularly and have always wanted to stay at the hilton chicago we booked a priceline room on the weekend of the half marathon the place was busy but the staff certainly found time for each individual guest the room was nice and just what we expected the pool area is also very nice for a downtown hotel the location was great as we were taking in the bears game on a thursday night and a sox game on a friiday night we would certainly stay there again and would recomment it to others great quality even at the regular room price
2,i recently stayed at the amalfi chicago with my wife on a business trip we decided to combine business with pleasure and made a long weekend out of our stay after business was concluded we enjoyed the luxurious in room spa service and stayed in the superb one bedroom suite with incomparable views of the surrounding city the individualized attention from check in to reservations was exceptional and better than what we usually receive from concierge service the amalfi actually delivered what they promised and more our weekend was more relaxing and enjoyable due to the excellent training of the staff and the amenities offered on site the hotel s design is modern and sophisticated with the decor being a delight to the senses lots of color and clean lines made a great impression and felt both modern and comfortable breakfast is served on each floor or in room and my wife especially appreciated the availability of the fresh fruit and yogurt being of european descent i enjoyed the croissants whole grain muffins real butter and marmalade we also brought along our standard poodle sterling and the amalfi is one of the few luxury hotels that allow for pet accommodations and understand that your pet is part of the family we purchased the pet pamper package and this allowed sterling to have his days while we had ours and we reunited in the evenings sterling slept in our room as usual at the foot of our bed and this contributed to our feeling at home while away for pet lovers this is a big plus finally transportation to and from our corporate jet was arranged with ease by the hotel so we did not bring an assistant with us on this trip to handle these arrangements as is normal this allowed us a bit more privacy and it is scarce for us to be able to do this another appreciated bonus of our stay thank you amalfi for a superb experience
2,the intercontinental chicago hotel is absolutely magnificent the rooms are of utmost standard and you get treated with such respect the staff is always there no matter what not only is the hotel beautiful but it surrounded by beautiful lights and beautiful skyscrapers i give it two dumbs up if you are ever in chicago the intercontinental chicago is the place to stay
3,the hard rock hotel was a natural choice for me to book a block of rooms for several colleagues traveling into chicago the location is fantastic a short walk to top notch city points of interest such as lake michigan millennium park and art museum and several fantastic restaurants nearby to choose from my co works loved the exterior of the building views from the rooms the art on the walls and crisp clean hip feeling of the hotel but not too over the top for business by far a better experience than your usual chain hotel where they shuffle you in and out and boring rooms here you feel special for the same price the lobby and bar have fun cozy areas to just hang out and watch the people pass on michigan ave or catch a real rock star in the lobby
1,the service was reasonably well they seemed to have my reservation and checked me in fairly easily the location was fine being that it was central to the city but i found out that it was also a tremendous drawback it was interesting that the survey i took at the hotel in order to obtain internet access at the hotel asked what my most important quality was in a hotel visit and my response quiet my visit was anything but mainly attributed to the fact that they put me on the second floor facing the street i awoke at a m and never did return to sleep because of the constant street noise and screeching of the l train that sounded as though it was just outside my window not the most conducive for a restful sleep prior to an important meeting at check out when i informed the hotel clerk of my dissatisfation he chuckled and said ah city noise
2,i took my family to the affinia chicago for a short vacation last summer and it was fabulous my kids say that their favorite part was the pool and the fact that the amusement park is really close by my wife was really stoked with spaffina the pampering and really made her feel special and they are very attentive to pets also my dog we left home but he would have been stoked with the pets amenities and attention the hotel is also connected to a ton of other hotels so their stash award lets you earn points at a lot of other hotels also my favorite part of all was that my family was happy and content which left me free to go over to underground wonderbar for a nice cocktail
2,if anyone is traveling to chicago i would strongly recommend the palmer house hilton i have spent two nights in this hotel during a recent business trip and i was impressed by the elegant feel and look of the hotel i had a guest room with a double bed at the first sight the room had perfect decor the double bed looked comfy and cozy it wasn t just a room because it also came with high speed internet and personalized listening options which were great features for a tired traveler like me since i was in a hurry in my two day stay i didn t have time to wander around the town for food it wasn t a problem because the hotel offered a few places to dine or simply for snacks the good thing is that their bar and lounge opened late at night i can assure you that they had great quality food and drinks if you are just touring the city the hotel is quite close to parks museum and a lot of shopping places if you just need a place to stay the view from the hotel was pretty good as well among all the hotels i have spent time in the palmer house hilton tops the list
0,the omni chicago hotel was in one word dreadful the hotel is in the heart of the city and traffic is chaotic the service is terrible if you want to wait for your room for and a half hours this is the place to go throughout a whole week beds are made once and bathrooms are never cleaned the hotel is no help when looking for a nice place to dine or a fun place to visit they give no info for any activities going on in chicago this hotel should be listed in the top worst hotels in america do not waste your time nor money staying at the omni chicago hotel
2,i was going to chicago last month and wanted a nice hotel that was close to restaurants and shops i did some research and believed the intercontinental would suit my needs i sure was not disappointed by my decision this hotel lots of historic charm despite being a larger hotel the service was top shelf the rooms while not large by any means were extremely well appointed and very comfortable my kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered as for me i was more impressed with the location to the magnificent mile the hotel also has a nice restaurant on site the food was very good and just like the hotel itself the restaurant provided perfect customer service dollar for dollar the intercontinental in chicago is a great deal and i will be staying there again
1,this hotel must have originally been an ordinary downtown hotel in a not very nice neighborhood the owners have painted it over and fixed up the lobby to make it an upscale overpriced boutique hotel but it s still just an ordinary hotel with a paint job stay here if you want to experience staying in a flophouse but with all the sleaze removed definitely stay at the chain s other location the burnham for a much much nicer hotel
1,my expectations were not high because i booked this hotel through priceline for night an amazing deal if not for the fact that you had to wait minutes for hot water i called the front desk to tell them that there was no hot water to which they nonchalantly replied try running it for to minutes they forgot to tell me to keep the water running after my shower if anyone else expected to use the shower my boyfriend who showered after me had to wait another minutes to get the shower warm again to make matters worse after room service was delivered we called and said we needed another fork they told us it would cost for the fork for delivey charge absolutely ridiculous at least with a star hotel you get hot water this is supposed to be a star hotel i guess you do get what you paid for i just feel bad for the people who actually paid full price
0,the name hard rock might trigger images of hip rockers but you will be sorely disappointed by staying here the website alludes to musicians and parties but if you re looking to hob nob with the rich and famous the hard rock falls short the hotel puts on a kitchy show by the decorations in the lobby and around the property but there is nothing exciting about this the service is mediocre and the rooms aren t clean i stayed at this hotel last year for a long weekend in chicago and was very much looking forward to some fun exciting romance i should have picked somewhere else save your money
0,i was extremely disappointed with my stay at the omni chicago hotel it was a hot summer day and i turned on the shower and only drips of hot water came out i called to complain and they assured me that someone would be in my room to fix the shower or show me how to use it i felt the person i spoke to was rude to me they were not accepting responsibility but talking down to me as if i was stupid after waiting minutes a bell hop came up to show me how to use the shower this was not a service person he could not get the shower to work either and apologized for the problem i was having he expected a tip and complained when i did not give him one nobody came up after that i was told i could switch to a different room so i had to pack up my belongings and move to another floor the shower did work in this other room but i didn t have the view of the city that i had in the first room i was looking at a brick wall plus there was a party in the next room that was so loud it kept me up all night i complained and the hotel staff told me they were vips and could not do anything about the noise this hotel was overpriced and my stay was miserable do not go to the omni hotel i ve stayed in a night motels with better service
3,beautifully appointed professionally staffed comfortable well located and elegant with wireless internet access plus free access in an alcove on the second floor fitness center a little small but fine if you use it at the right time good energy clientele easy access to michigan avenue next door to hour restaurant blocks from starbucks elevators that are there before you get your finger off the button they thought of everything will definitely return
3,recently returned from a two night stay at ambassador east hotel was looking for a comfortable hotel to stay at while visiting family now located in chicago mission was accomplished if you would like a quiet comfortable hotel in a great area this is it while some of the furnishings show some signs of their age it does not detract from the elegant style of the rooms and adds to the comfortable and home like feeling found staff to be friendly and helpful we will be return guests many times in the future for sure
0,after reading good reviews about the affinia hotel in chicago my husband and i decided to spend two nights there to celebrate our anniversary unfortunately the hotel missed the mark for us i did not expect to find bedbugs underneath the mattress in a star hotel because my husband and i have had a bad experience with bedbugs as a rule we always check underneath the mattress before settling down for the night in any hotel when i brought this to the attention of the front desk staff they practically accused us of planting the bugs there i was very humiliated and disappointed in the way the situation was handled needless to say we made the decision to pack our bags and went elsewhere to celebrate our anniversary i have written a letter to the hotel chain and hope that they will be more responsive to the situation i have also reported the incident to my credit card company to alert them that i will be refuting the charge for the one night the affinia charged to my account because we missed the cancellation deadline
3,we stay at hilton for nights last march it was a pleasant stay we got a large room with double beds and bathrooms the tv was ok a crt flat screen the coincierge was very friendly when we need the room was very cleaned when we arrived we ordered some pizzas from room service and the pizza was ok also the main hall is beautiful the breakfast is charged dollars kinda expensive the internet access wifi is charged dollars day pros low rate price huge rooms close to attractions at loop close to metro station cons expensive breakfast internet access charged tip when leaving the building always use the michigan av exit its a great view
2,fairmont chicago was a great choice for my wife and i we couldn t resist the elegant aria restaurant and the accommodations the room was impeccably clean and the city view was utterly amazing from the moment we checked in the staff produced a positive atmosphere with genuine hospitality my wife even suggested we should have had our wedding reception in their beautiful ball room overall i would rate fairmont chicago a
2,very beautiful hotel with a wonderful view the dinning selection is one of the best i have seen in chicago i have stayed many places downtown chicago and nothing matches this i am a single mother with two children and the concept of having a day care facility on site is just not great for me but for my children as well the shopping area has great selections right outside of the doors the biggest thing that i have to say is that the customer service was great with everything that i needed i give the hotel a out of
3,i got a sunday night stay for only off of priceline com so it would be hard to complain but this was truly a great hotel even if i paid double the first impression you get when you walk through the sliding doors of the hyatt regency chicago is wow the lobby is beautiful with a upscale mall type of look to it with an open area that has a restaurant plenty of couches seats etc to people watch and a lake with water fountains you take the escalator to the concierge directory check in area the hotel let me check in at i had a check in time i suggest you call ahead like i did so they know you are coming early the women at the desk was friendly and when i requested a higher level floor she was more than happy to look it up and even told me i have a room on the floor with a veiw of the river or you can go higher with no view i thought it was pretty nice to give me that information so that i wouldnt get stuck with a room with a view of a wall the rooms are big i had a doubles room the beds were beautiful with great pillows blankets headboards etc an ipod alarm clock was a nice century touch to the room great to plug in your ipod listen to some music and get ready for a night out or when relaxing after a long day of touring chicago the view was very nice and the bathroom was spotless and had great toiletries another great feature is the concierge area s computers that gives you access to printing your boarding pass before you get to the airport you simply look at the screen click on your airline icon and following the instructions i had my boarding passes in about a minute came in handy when i got to ohare and was able to skip a long line of frustrated passengers i was only in the hotel for day but it was by far one of the better hotel experiences i have had and i travel alot it is a business hotel but definitely a great choice for families and couples definitely would stay here again when im passing through chicago
2,my stay at the talbott was a wonderful experience the service at this upscale hotel was beyond my expectations the gold coast location is close to michigan ave the museums and many of the other sites chicago has to offer if you are visiting chicago i highly recommend the talbott
3,this is a great hotel the views are fabulous the service it friendly and the location is superb we booked a room on an upper floor and had access to the lounge where breakfast and snacks were available with picture perfect views of the chicago river the only negative is that the ceilings in the hall and room are low and can make you feel a little cramped we booked our room for a night for memorial day weekend it was a steal i highly recommend this hotel to anyone and will be returning
0,i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers recently and i was completely dissatisfied when i arrived the clerk was very rude to my guest and myself we finally got all of our things figured out and went to our room there is a river right outside and i constantly heard boats passing by my bathroom was disgusting and not to mention very small i did not have a very pleasant experience at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers
3,a bunch of us got together and we had a great time in this hotel we asked for limes and they gave us like a punch bowl of them the rooms were so awesome you really have to see it to believe how extradionary this hotel is i love the decorations on every floor and being surrounded by such elegance will definitely stay here again
1,stayed here in november on a leisure trip to chicago hotel is very dated with some rooms that just aren t good enough front desk staff was rude will not be staying here again prefer the swissotel and the hyatt properties regency is similarly priced and park hyatt is more and a list of boutique hotels in the area as well kimpton etc pros the only hotel that opens onto michigan avenue very close to all of the excitement eno wine bar has a great selection of cheeses rooms are clean cons some hotel rooms just make no sense our first room was tiny and had a window overlooking a ledge effectively no view and our second room had two windows that looked out onto a brick wall actually no view you have to pay for everything internet gym and the pool which was not available due to renovation entire hotel was very old not in a classical sense but in a ghost story one front desk staff was rude
3,the hard rock hotel chicago has become my favorite hotel i ve stayed there at least times now and have never had anything other than a wonderful experience as you might have guessed it has a super rock roll theme with some music paraphanelia in the lobby and on each floor s elevator lobby the rooms all have large photo murals that are themed to different musicians you can request being on the floor of your favorite band like kiss aerosmith etc the rooms are great well appointed super comfortable beds and luxurious sheets and wonderous pillows the large tv has a cool sound system that ramps up the viewing experience there s a spacious desk in each room with a mini bar i ve always had a room with big windows and a view down michigan ave the hotel sits right on michigan a block from the canal the bathrooms are furnished with absolutely great fixtures sporting a great design some of the showers have windows in side of them you can shower and enjoy the view down michigan or close the waterproof drapes i ve never had anything but a great experience with the staff here front desk doorman etc are all great there s a lobby bar that still feels intimate and has nice energy big screen tv to catch the latest scores too of course rock roll music pumps thru the place you can stay at a plain hotel anywhere but this is a great well designed fun and memorable hotel that you ll want to return back to if i had one concern it would be the rather crazy charge for parking your car overnight my daily car parking rate was close to per night which i m sorry to say is about the going rate in the loop stay here be cool
2,just what i needed at james i can t tell you how impressed i was with my stay at the james chicago hotel i came into town for a week long business conference and was referred to the james by a friend the crisp clean contemporary ambiance made me feel like i was on a relaxed vacation rather than work it was luxury without being over the top my room was clean comfortable and was above all standards comfortable in my down time i enjoyed a relaxing massage at the spa and happy hour at the jbar and i highly recommend dinner at the david burke primehouse the customer service from all the staff members from front desk to house keeping to the bartender was excellent i plan on returning on my spring vist and look forward to another phenomenal experience
2,the magnificent mile in chicago is a great place to visit and staying at the affinia chicago just made it that much better the location is awesome all of the great shopping spots were just moments away and getting to navy pier was a cinch and the accommodations themselves were wonderful the hotel lets you completely customize your stay all the way down to choosing your own pillow very impressed overall
3,having had a great stay at the monaco last fall with friends i was disappointed initially to arrive on saturday with husband and find that they didn t have our quikbook made reservation in their system and they had no rooms available for sat eve but they immediately took responsibility for their mistake by doing the following found us a nice room at the neighboring swissotel and paid for it gave us cab fare to get the blocks over there paid for our valet parking that eve so naturally when they asked if we were interested in returning for sunday eve when they did have room we said yes when we returned they gave us a corner suite with jacuzzi tub for our quikbook rate now that s what i call a recovery
0,the conrad chicago hotel had some of the worst service i have ever dealt with i got the executive room with a king size bed when i got in the sheets were stained with some type of chocolate or mud i called down to front desk and it took them an hour to come up and change them for me they have a pillow menu which i tried to select from but they were out of over half of them the ipod dock was not working either also the room service servers were very short with me and delivered my food luke warm this hotel is the worst in chicago and i would never recommend going there
3,i loved it here my boyfriend and i booked this hotel online and were a little worried what it would be like since we paid next to nothing for our nights here i ve paid more to stay at the santa barbara motel gorgeous hotel great staff fun bar lounge area and we were most impressed with the room the large windows in the bathroom were the best i took a bubble bath one night while looking at the views of navy pier and the skyline i remember thinking this is really living the room was comfortable and quiet again with great views just like in the bathroom chicago is a wonderful town i have nothing but good things to say about it can t wait to come back
3,we attended a bachorette party in chicago in aug there were girls total we had rooms and i did not hear one complaint from anyone during our entire extended weekend never been to chi town before i booked our hotel based on reviews from ta and we were not disappointed the staff is wonderful the happy hour was just fabulous the room was nice and clean with a great double headed shower and aveda products was an extra bonus then you also get free internet in your room the hotel was chic and hip without the pretentiousness we still talk about what a wonderful time we had and we all agree that if we ever go back to chicago we will be staying at the amalfi again trust me the pics don t do it justice
1,when you re standing in a craptastic excuse for a shower buttnaked and cold with soap in your hair because the water from the shower head has gone from a weak spray to a dribble to nothing coming out at all nothing in the world will ever convince you to stay here again the worst part is that the hotel knows this is a problem they told me that it happens to the upper floors and i wasn t even staying on the highest floor as if that makes it ok i can look past the rustic decor of the room and take it for what it is an inexpensive place to crash but c mon a girl s gotta shower
3,we stayed at the ae for two nights for a three generation girls weekend grandma mom and daughter i looked at their website for an idea of rates and looked at any packages that might interest us then i called the property directly and was assisted by a very gracious man named reece rates were a bit high for the saturday night portion of our stay but when i requested the american girl package he was more than happy to honor the advertised rate the american girl package was perfect for us my year old daughter was thrilled they give you a doll bed a backpack and a travel kit to keep they have matching bathrobes for girl and doll you don t get to keep those she also got a special welcome letter and a complimentary room service snack from a specially printed menu our room was large and clean it had two double beds with nice linens two chairs a desk and a clean bathroom the employees are all very friendly and helpful we had a drink in the pump room but did not eat there we ate breakfast nearby at a great place called the coast this hotel is north of michigan ave but it is just a short pleasant walk to the mag mile i would definately stay here again in chicago
2,my stay at sheraton chicago hotel and towers was wonderful i stayed in the traditional guest room and i slept good i was able to get to my meeting well rested thank you sheraton bobby
2,we decided to stay at the james last weekend with our kids we reserved the family adventurer with paul frank it s a special offer by the hotel to entice visitors to see the local museums and aquarium we ended up receiving chicago city passes which ultimately paid for themselves and tickets for the chicago children s museum my kids had a ball we ended the day with a milk and cookies turn down service and a special pair of pajamas that my daughter adored all in all a great weekend where my kids were the focus the adults certainly weren t forgotten since we had a great breakfast in the room the next morning
3,my stay was quick but awesome after a long day seeing a substantial line at check in was a bit of a groaner but then i saw the self serve kiosks i was checked in with keys in hand in under minutes in the morning i was able to check out on the tv in my room the hotel is a beautiful historic landmark with all the amenities of a modern hotel and all the charm of its origins the bed was fabulously comfortable i wish i could live there they have many rooms wtih bathrooms i stayed in a room like that once with a friend and we didn t know ahead of time that we had two bathrooms talk about squeals of delight that was about years ago in virginia beach i was by myself at the hilton and had no need for a room with two bathrooms but it s the first time i ve seen this since what a great feature
3,we always stay at the sheraton chicago hotel towers when we take our kids to the city you can t beat the location which is in walking distance of navy pier and michigan ave the hotel is also just a couple of blocks from the fabulous fox obel a high end grocery store with many prepared items available to go and a great cafe that serves a stellar breakfast the hotel staff are professional and courteous and the rooms are more than adequate with very comfy beds my kids enjoy the pool with it s windows that overlook the chicago river
0,i stayed at the hilton chicago during a recent business trip i elected to go with their executive suite upgrade all i can say is what upgrade it s barely anything above what you get normally and for the price i paid i was expecting much better acommodations because i arrived around the night i checked in delayed flight i did not get the concierge service as it stops at i find that an odd hour to stop a service like that especially when you re expecting a guest who has not checked in yet beyond that it took them minutes to get me into my room first it was a room mix up then it was a missing key card that was extremely frustrating as i was tired and i had a presentation to give the next morning speaking of the next morning the complimentary breakfast was a joke when i just want a stale muffin and a bad cup of coffee for breakfast i ll stay at the next super i find and the wireless internet in the room that you actually have to pay for on top of everything else was a horrible connection with angonizingly slow speed i will not be staying at the hilton chicago every again even though i frequent chicago this tops out my list of horrible hotel experiences by a long shot
0,i want everyone to know about the awful experience i had at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers when we arrived at the hotel the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system i had called earlier in the day and confirmed it after speaking to the on duty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked we later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically i believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money i for one won t be going back to this hotel
3,i want to recognize so many people who were exemplary in their service sylvia rollins head concierge i wanted a fairly last minute reservation at mk restaurant i spoke with sylvia on the phone just a few days prior to arrival and within minutes had the desired reservation ryan lettier concierge provided us detailed information on the architectural cruises our morning cruise ended up being cancelled by the tour operator and ryan provided a late check out time to cover us until we could get back to the monaco turndown service was provided as requested and housekeeping in general seemed to be at a high standard even the bellman went out of their way to ask if we knew how to get the train etc when leaving the hotel the rooms are tastfully furnished in that whimiscal hotel monaco feel beds and bedding both very comfortable the complimentary happy hour and morning coffee tea service were both very utililzed by the hotel guests
3,if you re in chicago and want to stay in the loop the allegro hotel is perfect for you it s centrally located stylish rooms and attentive staff i stayed at the hotel for nights and was very pleased with everything the bed was very comfy and had plenty of fluffy pillows large flat screen tv radio with ipod docking station and bathroom was hip and clean everyone that i came in contact with was very friendly and helpful my last day there i ordered room service and not only was my meal perfect and delivered on time the kitchen called to see if everything was alright i have never had that kind of follow up service i ve stayed at the palomar in dc another kimpton hotel and received exceptional service there too i will definitely see if kimpton has a hotel at my next destination
3,stayed here for nights in apri from check in the stay was perfect all round staff were so helpfuly and friendly especially chris and scott the location couldn t be better right on michigan avenue so easy access to everything room was lovely and spacious and always clean and tidy at the end of the day will definately recommend it to friends and family
2,i truly enjoyed my stay at the omni chicago hotel we stayed in a suite which was clean and extremely nice at a very reasonable rate my husband and i spent quite a bit of time in the indoor pool but personally i preferred laying out on the sundeck service was excellent they were friendly and all of our needs were met promptly i would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to have a great experience in the downtown chicago area
1,i would not recommend staying at the swissotel in chicago i was travelling with a friend and we arrived at different times she had booked the hotel but had added my name to the reservation since i would be arriving first the night manager at the hotel was extremely rude and told me i could not check in since they could not find the note about my name being on the reservation this was their mistake they told me i could sit in the lobby for hours until my friend arrived they did nothing to try and help me until i stood there and complained for twenty minutes i can t believe that a manager would treat a customer this way there are other great hotels in chicago this hotel is not worth the aggravation
1,hi ho hi ho off to chicago we go here s the skinny if you re hoping to run into a washed up rock star cece deville for us and no the teenagers had no idea who he was you may want to spend your hard earned money here i took my younger sister and a couple of her friends teenagers for an overnighter in chicago on our way to wisconsin i chose the hard rock for the ambiance i mean come on it is supposed to be cool well it wasn t the positives it is in the carbon carbide building which is beautiful the location it sits in the middle of everything the lobby has two computers for guest use the fitness center is very nice cardio machines have individual tv s and there are head phones in case you forgot yours they have protein bars for those that like them for a post workout snack check in and out was quick and valet was very courteous the negatives the rooms were small and ours wasn t clean pistachio shells on the floor the rooms were painted purplish gray we were on the prince floor with a picture of bob marley hanging on one of the walls the girls thought the coolest part about the hotel was the fuzzy throw pillows bathroom had only a shower and not a full tub the cable reception was poor i kept looking for the bunny ears to fix the picture it isn t anywhere near the hard rock cafe there was very little memorabilia there is no pool and yes i knew this when i made the reservation to wrap it up i won t be staying here again if i am going to drop almost benjamins on a hotel room i will stay at the palmer house hilton but that is a whole different review
0,i d expect a luxury hotel to pay more attention to details the room really hadn t been thoroughly cleaned i found hairballs under the bed the mirrors were streaked etc the desk staff took forever to even acknowledge me when i was checking in three of them two on the phone and nobody even made eye contact for minutes then they gave the vaguest answers to some pretty basic questions about the neighborhood you d think they d know where to find a starbucks the internet was ridiculously slow the whole two days i was there
2,my husband and i stayed at the conrad chicago on our anniversary tripped and had a wonderful experience thanks to the staff not only is the hotel and a great location with many places to eat and socialize within walking distance but they rooms were also clean and quiet the staff was helpful and accommodated our requests we ll definitely be staying here again next time we visit chicago also if you stay you must eat at the restaurant fabulous food
1,i booked this hotel for a business trip since i was able to get a rate on travelzoo and figured i d save my company some money i had also read excellent reviews on tripadvisor i had a guaranteed and confirmed room reservation for two nights in november when i arrived in chicago at i decided to go to dinner prior to checking in so called the hotel to request a late check in and was told no problem when i arrived at the hotel at i was told they didn t have a room for me and that i d have to move to the four points sheraton which they paid for it was a major inconvenience to have to move and completely unacceptable that my confirmed room was given away i was told that they overbooked and didn t get as many cancellations as they expected i did check into the hotel the next day and once there did have a good experience i would recommend staying here but do ensure that your reservation is indeed confirmed and avoid any late check ins or you might not have a room the experience designers were great and very helpful the rooms were very nice and comfortable felt like home the breakfast could stand to add on some bagels for the healthy factor it was nice that they did have fruit i think that once the kinks are worked out that this will be a great hotel they just need to get the basics down
0,me and my business associate had a job in chicago and wanted to stay somewhere that had more features we did some research online and came across the hotel moncaco we decided to stay for nights when we arrived we noticed that it was in a busy part of the city with bright lights the staff was upstiff and didn t not offer much hospitality our room did have a view but of the city lights and kept our room bright even with the curtains closed the beds appeared soft but did not offer much comfort for what we paid we expected more
1,after leaving some important documents in the room i called and asked for the lost and found department seven times over the course of a week eventually i had enough and asked for a manager and was put on hold then disconnected finally a deceivingly friendly operator promised me she would have someone call me back in a few minutes it never happened so avoid this place because after they rip you off once they ll keep doing it later they cannot be trusted at their word
0,homewood suites is a hilton group hotel located in downtown chicago though close to many sights when we visited there was extensive construction going on along michigan avenue so every morning we were awakened right at am to the sound of jackhammering and bulldozers we reserved the basic suite though we arrived at pm well past check in time our room was not ready for minutes the management apologized but did not offer any sort of compensation for our inconvenience once the suite was ready it was nice but then we quickly discovered that there was no hot water in our bathroom we were relocated to another room with apologies but again no offer of compensation for the trouble once we were finally settled the free welcome dinner reception had wine and beer the food was okay but we were so frazzled from the issues we had checking in that anything would have tasted good at that point the staff suggested their complementary grocery shopping service we though it was a good idea since we were already so tired unfortunately it took them three hours to finally deliver the groceries to our suite and the bill was far more than we expected all in all we were disappointed with our experience at homewood suites we understand there are problems that may arise but the fact that the management did nothing to make it up to us is unacceptable i would not suggest this hotel to a friend visiting chicago
0,i stayed at the affnia hotel in chicago and was extremely unsatisfied i would recommend everyone to avoid this hotel i paid overall for nights in a cheap small untidy room granted i ve stayed at hotels of similar quality but never have i paid so much for one of them i could not believe what i saw when i walked into the room it was tiny and there was small patches of mold on the wall that had been painted over the breakfast i ordered wasn t terrible but certainly wasn t good the wifi connection was horrendously slow if you want to spend a big buck on a hotel fine just don t spend it here
0,the talbott hotel claims to be chicago s premiere small luxury hotel after staying there and experiencing the service environment and the hotel in general i can say with confidence that this just isn t true i arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and i was immediately disappointed no one came to my car to collect my bags and i was forced to lug them inside myself the doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags once inside the atmosphere was not what i expected the lighting was poor leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building the carpet looked dirty as if it hadn t been vacuumed or washed in quite some time and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage when i arrived at the front desk i was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me after checking in i went up to my room and was once again disappointed the bed was very uncomfortable and i ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water that night i ordered room service the food took minutes to get to my room and when it finally arrived it was cold the fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them i would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends and probably not to my enemies either stay away
3,i have just returned from a lovely shopping trip to chicago it is a very nice hotel and i will love to stay there if i visit chicago again there is a lot of positive to say about the hotel staff is excellent never experienced such an excellent service that alone is worth coming back for was pleasantly surprised that the room rate was including breakfast a few things that could make this hotel even better a hand shower in the bathroom the hairdryer to be placed in the bedroom instead of the bathroom when the bathroom is all damp after a shower i prefer leaving the bathroom to dry my hair free internet access in the lobby i was surprised i had to pay or usd for minutes to log on and check in with my airline only with a few airlines you can check in without paying
0,the ambassador east is a particularly crappy property given the numerous quality hotels in and around the gold coast unfortunately i saw an amazing rate and decided to book this experience will be a reminder that you get what you pay for while the lobby was gorgeous and appears to match the photos on the website the room i was assigned was run down and looked nothing like the photos posted on the website it looked like someone had put a quick coat of paint on the walls but the furniture was old and the fixtures in the bathroom were rusty the room also smelled of must or mildew while the room did have air conditioning as advertised it was an in window unit that sounded like it was on its last leg i was only here for a single night but had i been here for anywhere longer i would have requested a refund please if you re staying in this part of town do yourself a favor and book at any one of the numerous other properties around here the hampton inn and hilton garden inn are both nearby clean and often have special offers these aren t the only properties in the area but both of these will save you a potentially unpleasant stay
1,having stayed at the excellent affinia chain in ny i had very high expectations when i saw the trip advisor rating i immediately booked what a huge disappointment the quality simmons pillow top mattress is covered with very cheap foam pillows the kind they sell in the store for you cannot sleep on these the windows are so thin you can hear the buzzing from walk don t walk sign on superior below the walls are so thin that when my neighbor smoked i was awaken around midnight my room engulfed in smoke odor a call downstairs yielded no results there are nice furnishings but many are chipped showing bare wood the desk chair was full of loose threads the water flow is very weak but the towels are nice there are unpainted floorboards the kind you find in day s inn they charge for internet service the tiny lobby has materials and pictures of what the hotel will eventually look like the sign outside is also a banner having stayed all over the u s you are better off at red roof this is really an embarassment for the affinia chain wait until they complete the renovations in i did supply this feedback at my checkout and the front desk apologized by shaking my hand good heart but the problems are not fixable
0,when my husband and i went to amalfi hotel we were expecting first class service first when we got there we learned they had given our room to another guest and we were not able to get a suite like we had booked room service took forever and the food was subpar supposedly they had planners to help explore the area but we requested one and never saw hide nor hair of a planner the spa staff seemed incompetent the only positive things i can say about amalfi hotel was that the rooms were stylish as advertised i give this hotel two stars
0,my stay at the hyatt regency was an experience that i ll never ever forget not in a good way check in was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant i went up to my room and looked around all seemed ok at first i was bushed so i flopped on the bed ohhhhh noooooo the bed was as hard as a military bunk from my army days but i was so tired that i just passed out of course i woke up with a back ache great i figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so i plugged the tub turned the hot water on full force and poured in some shower gel i put my foot in expecting some real heat the water was barely lukewarm i called the front desk but they were no help the clerk just apologized frustrated at this point i turned on the tv and switched on the air i put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and i saw something slimy inside of the vent it looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something i couldn t take anymore of this i went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk it seemed as though the guy was on something he kept smiling as he apologized no empathy as if he s used to hearing about the goop in the ac he offered me a free night but there is no way that i d stay at this place again ever
1,three nights there on business hadn t realized that the place was under construction and therefore the bar and restaurant are in the basement very bleak told the front desk that i hadn t realized about the construction so i d have to switch hotels they said they were still going to charge me for nights so i stayed tv didn t work tried to get them to fix it and they ignored me eventually after i called again a few hours later a couple grumpy maintanance guys came and fixed it long and complicated experience at the business center which doesn t open until btw where i ended up paying to print pages had to buy these cards and then the woman behind the desk ended up printing them herself anyway and charging me for them i was left with on a card for use at the business center in the basement of the swissotel in chicago miles from where i live i asked for a refund on the card and no surprise she declined to help me with that nice room nice view but the hotel is sterile and the service was incredibly bad worst experience i ve ever had at a hotel when traveling for business
3,just spent three nights at the amalfi hotel while in chicago on business booked a king corner room and loved it largest room i ve ever had in a hotel in chicago incredibly comfortable very clean the breakfast and evening cocktails were a nice bonus too and the location couldn t be beat walking distance to the the river the loop michigan ave shopping and convenient to public transportation i noticed a number of reviews commented on the noise yes there is some street noise and the building across the street is under construction the noise from that was usually between if you want to sleep late during the week ask for a room on the back side but really in downtown chicago it s not going to be silent if you want silence stay in the suburbs if you want a great hotel at a great price right in the thick of everything stay at the amalfi
2,when my new fiance told me about his business trip to chicago i was quite annoyed mostly because he insisted i come along he made up for me so not wanting to come along and be alone all weekend with this wonderful hotel his mother told him all about this hotel when she and her husband stayed here in the summer of she loved it and so did i i was so bummed about being all alone for most of the weekend but the decor wonderful staff and massages made up for it i spent my time in the spa and the asian restaurant and couldn t have asked for a better experience i am definately coming along on the next business trip
1,i stayed there on october when i pulled the covers of my bed there was a small dark brown insect the size of a grain of rice which was either a bed bug or cockroach i trapped it under a glass see the attached pictures and called the front desk the housecleaning person claimed it was a cockroach absolutely horrible service by the hotel management to respond to the problem failing to follow through on promises they made to me setting aside the bug problem i caution that the windows are quite thin we could hear a lot of the street noise which made for a hard night s sleep not to mention worrying about insects even after changing rooms for a night after tax i strongly encourage you to check for alternatives
3,when making my reservation i made it for one of the most busiest weekends during the summer memorial day the staff was able to get my family in at an affordable rate the suites are very spacious clean cozy and comfortable upon on arriving staff were friendly willing to exceed expectations and serve me with enthusiasm the hot breakfast was delicious each morning the beds are very comfortable and provided a good nights rest i would recommend this hotel to my friends and anyone who need additional space when traveling and on a budget compared to other chicago hotels
0,i recently stayed at the ambassador east hotel for two night and my visit was nothing short of disappointing expecting to have a wonderfully romantic weekend with my fiance we specifically chose this hotel because we prefer boutique hotels for the extra attention from the staff and unique atmosphere our expectations for the ambassador were not met the room was small and frankly outdated the bathroom smelled musty the a c in the room had two settings polar cold or off the walls did nothing to muffle sound from adjacent rooms and it was loud at night a good night s sleep was impossible staff were indifferent do yourself a favor and avoid this hotel frankly it s not worth the steep price and mediocre character since there are far better and more accommodating boutique hotels in chicago i know i won t be back at this place
0,traveled to this hotel on a family vacation we chose this hotel because it was pet friendly upon arrival we smelled just how pet friendly it was the dog that greets you attacked my dog there was constant barking throughout the night and during breakfast i found hair in my eggs i would not recommend this hotel
2,i just came back from this awesome terrific hotel last week and i have to say i loved it my wife and i were there for a week due to a business meeting and right when i stepped into the hotel i knew that this business vacation will be well spent the customer service was very great and an employee even guided us toward our room we were introduced to a fantastically lit room with beds a flat screen tv and even free internet access my wife loved it and kept on using the free shampoo and body bath soap when i headed down to the lobby for my conference i got lost and asked one of the people who worked there where my meeting might be held he leaded me to the door and i was very impressed there is a fitness center which i went everyday and this great restaurant called c house situated nicely next to the hotel lobby where i had a nice steak and my wife a salad all in all i thought that the trip was really worth it and my stay was very welcoming at the affinia chicago i highly recommend that whenever you visit chicago you should stay there you will not regret it
1,i chose this hotel for a nice weekend getaway and was nothing but disappointed the previous weekend i stayed at a star hotel a few blocks away and was much more impressed there the hard rock had a number of issues including very dark room not much light artificial or natural lots of street noise very cheap decor and furniture broken cabinet door very warm room said they would send maintenance but they never arrived had bar charges on account that were not ours overall i was very surprised that this was a star hotel i expected a much better experience
1,truly a tattered run down facility that you should avoid rooms are small dirty and in no way represents the web sites representations staff is poorly trained and a very big disappointment at best it is a star facility ands with so many options in chicago please avoid this one i had no choice to stay here as a client booked the rooms
3,we stayed at the conrad for only one evening but it was such an amazing room we would have liked to stay longer we were on the newly renovated floor and the room was gorgeous and super clean there was a flat screen bose sound system and even an ihome for our ipod wireless was free and they bring you a free bottle of water at turn down everyone was very helpful and so friendly we can t wait to go back again
2,as i walked into the hotel i was greeted warm heartedly they took my information from me in an efficient manner and got me to my room quickly i was very pleased to see that my bed was laid out perfectly and that there was plenty of towels in the bathroom also i was happy to see that the shampoo and soap provided was sufficient overall i was very happy with my stay at this hotel
0,a recent stay at the james hotel chicago revealed the the recent updating at this hotel was a facelift only although the rooms and public areas look nice the hotel still needs serious work our first room was not clean when we arrived and this non smoking room had a serious odor of cigarette smoke we asked for a new room which was clean and odor free we had to involve the manager before our request was granted the new room was better at first glance but was severely lacking we could not get the temperature properly regulated the room was always either too hot or too cold for our two night stay in a hotel commanding the rates of the james we expect the room temperature to be a comfort which is taken for granted not something which is a constant battle our mattress was horribly uncomfortable when the rooms were updated the james skipped new mattresses ours was worn to the point of having indentations you can t get out of when you lie down you sort of sink into a hole this matter of basic comfort should not be an issue in a luxury hotel last but not least we found the hotel to be loud at almost all times during our stay in spite of the calming decor the noise level was raucous and not at all conducive to a good night s sleep all in all we were unhappy with our accommodations at the james chicago and would recommend you avoid the hotel even though it is in a convenient location you will be happier almost anywhere else
0,the intercontinental chicago was not as great an experience as i was expecting it to be when i first arrived the front desk staff could not find my reservation in the system they then tried to make me book a higher paying room i ended up having to ask for the manager who conveniently was able to locate a room for me with the same rate i was expecting top notch service and class but apparently those services are reserved for the elite i was not doted on as i should have been and found that i had long wait times when i placed an order with room service or needed the concierge for the price i was paying to stay there i would have thought there would have been more of a catered and personal touch to the service
2,my family really enjoyed this hotel the weekend we were in chicago check in was quick and easy the staff was friendly and very helpful the room was clean the beds were comfortable and we had a great view of chicago next time we come to chicago we will definitely stay here again
0,this hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere it smells because pets are allowed this hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed there was mold in our room and bathroom pet hair everywhere kids love pools how can they claim to be kid friendly without one my kid was bored the food was basically the same every day no variation in the menu pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their travel club because our room didn t even remotely resemble the pictures they did the old bait and switch we reserved a family room when we opened the door of our room we realized that it wasn t what the website pictured or had what the website described we kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers definitely do not recommend this hotel
2,we stayed for two nights for a meeting it is an upscale chain hotel and was very clean the service was very good as the hotel front desk employees were kind and knowledgeable the rooms are decent sized and have soft mattresses the restaurant has good seafood but was a bit expensive we would come back again
2,i had to write this review my tired body walked through the doors of the fairmont it felt like i walked through heaven s gates the lobby was majestic and the staff was so friendly that i was instantly energized the front desk staff was very helpful and quick to find my reservation and get my bags up to my room they were so nice to inform me of the health club and spa oh those wonderful spa treatments that are offered are incredible i took advantage of a soothing pedicure during my visit my very first as well as a massage i was amazed at the size of the meeting conference room that we used for an afternoon the room was so clean and the bed was better than the one at home the food downstairs in the restaurant smelled so good that as tired as i was after the meeting instead of room service i went in and the food was mouth watering delicious and the wait staff was very hospitable they take great pride in everything even the wake up call was friendly my stay was so great that i want to go back again soon
2,friendly staff clean building and rooms the hotel was located nearby everything we were interested in seeing staff was willing to help give directions and very knowledgable of city rooms were beautifully designed and well lit spacious and comfortable
2,excellent staff and customer service very clean and spotless elegant and luxurious with a beautiful ocean view the bed is very comfortable and relaxing i give it a five star
0,chicago has many wonderful luxury hotels for tourists and business travelers when visiting the windy city however the conrad hotel and resort is one to avoid while the description promises clean accommodations luxury amenities and deep soaking tubs in relity the rooms fall short of expectations i opened the door to my suite to find a musty smell in the room similar to that of an old neglected closet a bit disappointed i decided to ignore this fact hoping to take a nice long soak after my travels i made my way to the bathroom while i did find a large deep bathtub there was a hard water stain giving it a dingy look hardly what i expected for the price i paid for the accommodations in the corner of the bathroom i found a reminder of a pevious guest a clump of blond hair the maid service seemed to be lacking not to be deterred from enjoying my stay i decided to watch television on the inch flat screen i had been promised unfortunately the battery to the remote control was dead i called the front desk at my wits end to complain about the issues but was greeted by a desk clerk with a very sassy attitude who seemed to doubt my every word overall i would definitely not recommend the conrad hotel and resort in chicago my room was dirty the staff was unfriendly and the ammenities were few and far between on my next stay in chicago i will definitely stay elsewhere
3,it has been a couple of years since i stayed here and got it for a night last weekend on hotwire i paid only and stayed a saturday night i was very impressed with the redecorating done to the hotel the lobby has always been great but the rooms were a little shabby in the past not any more as the hotel has been redecorated in the last few years the location is still amazing and with the berghoff open again there is a great restaurant within walking distance
1,over hyped and over priced the fact that they have a complimentary wine reception every night at doesnt take away from the fact that they have terrible beds and the place isnt as clean as it should be for a star hotel the hallways smelled like a dog parlor and the carpets in my room look like they hadn t been cleaned well ever the decorative pillows on my bed were so filthy they were actually stained brown and looked like they had been sitting outside for everyone to use and then put back on my bed the decor of the hotel was nice and eclectic but it wasnt enough to convince me to ever stay here again the bed was the most uncomfortable thing i have every tried to sleep on i couldnt sleep the whole week that i stayed there it was hard and lumpy and the pillows were tiny my final say is that it is an over priced holiday inn
2,having recently been in chicago for business and based on proximity and aesthetics i decided to reserve a room at the conrad hotel in chicago and i couldn t have been more delighted with every aspect of my two night stay every conceivable amenity is available from the plasma flat screen to both wired and wireless internet connections available i was able to stay in constant contact with the office all while in the enviable lap of luxury my room was not only comfortable and clean but warm and inviting just as if it were home away from home if you re in the chicago area reserve a room at the conrad hotels and resorts and you will not be disappointed
2,this is the hotel for the discriminating business traveler it offers spacious rooms that are elegant and refined with a cozy area complete with chairs and fireplace they are the perfect place to entertain clients or discuss strategy for a business meeting with a colleague the restaurant offers just the location to impress a perspective client and all of this elegance and refinement in the heart of downtown chicago
2,my husband and i recently chose the palmer house hilton for a rare couple s getaway from our usual life and an escape it truly provided there is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time let alone with ever elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user a bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us because things like alarm clocks hairdryers and ironing boards were already there electronic media even available for rent with a comfortable bed control over how the room felt no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the chicago culture in close proximity too often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning but the hilton was a true vacation thank you
1,my wife and i frequently stay downtown for a night in the city we have been to many hotels in the downtown chicago area my opinion of the swissotel spend your money elsewhere and get a much better experience the swissotel has a very cold atmosphere and its very difficult to feel comfortable the room was average at best however the cost per night was far from average the view from our room faced a construction site which is a soon to be trump building that will block the lake view from the hotel other hotels are also a couple blocks closer to the action and again for the cost we would expect more our room and the lobby areas had a strange smell and someone was actually vacuuming the hallway floors at which woke us up we called the front desk to complain and were extremely shocked to be treated rudely by the person at the desk we also had a couple of friends come downtown and they were waiting in the lobby when they were approached by a gentleman asking if they were guests of the hotel they said no but that they were waiting on us and he actually asked them what our names were and then they looked it up to verify that we were on the guest register he didnt even apologize to them for the inconvenience and imbarrassment overall it was just an unpleasant experience because we were expecting top notch treatment spend your money for a nicer hotel just off the lake or off michigan avenue for real top notch service anyone giving this hotel a top review obviously hasnt had the opportunity to stay at a nicer hotel in the area
2,the location of this hotel was superb our room was spacious and the view was spectacular the staff at the hotel treated my family with the upmost respect one of the front desk staff even helped my five year old tie his shoes while we were waiting for the porter we will stay here again and advise our friends to do the same
2,having come to chicago with my three sisters for a relaxing weekend of shopping and spa days the hotel allegro chicago filled every bit of my checklist we arrived and immediately were checked in and shown to our rooms we both had the double double deluxe the rooms were gorgeous well taken care of clean comfortable well decorated and luxurious the hotel also has a spa which was perfect because we didn t even have to leave the hotel for our relaxing spa day the hotel has great staff they were always attentive to our needs my favorite part was the complimentary tea and cofee i am a coffee addict and getting my caffeine fix any time of every day was great stay at the hotel allegro chicago if you want great service from a relaxing and luxurious hotel in the heart of chicago s hustle and bustle
1,we stayed nights over spring break in what was called a jr suite but resembled a wide hallway with a window at one end bad cheap furniture carpet that stops short of reaching the wall a tv that sticks out into the middle of the room and a window that whistled when the wind blew bad bad experience find aother hotel plenty in the area
3,spent two nights at the intercontinental on a business trip this is a tremendous towering hotel in one of the best locations in chicago right on the magnificent mile and superbly convenient for shopping and well placed for the business area my room was in the historic tower a masonic club which has been converted at enormous expense the effort has been worthwhile my room was very large and well furnished with a beautiful bathroom which contained a separate shower cubicle it had breathtaking views down michigan avenue there is a superb recreation centre with an impressive swimming pool beautiful bars and a good restaurant zest that serves a great breakfast there is wifi in the rooms per day and tea and coffee making facilities no trouser press but there is an ironing board and iron the staff is friendly and anxious to please i recommend this hotel in the strongest possible terms it s expensive but it will be difficult to find a better one in chicago
2,when i was asked to stay at the swissotel in chicago i immediately went to their website to check them out what i found there was decent nothing really stood out it wasn t until i actually went there that my eyes were opened the amazing customer service i received there was exceptional every whim and detail i asked for they helped me perfectly the room was neatly fixed when i arrived and was cleaned every day when i asked about more towels the maids were happy to help me out if i were ever to be in that area again i know exactly where i m staying the swissotel
0,i had such high hopes when i booked a stay at the knickerbocker hotel in chicago a few short weeks ago when i arrived i should have known things would not be as i expected them to be the host at the desk was rude and seemed put out that i was there when i finally got checked in and arrived in my room i found that the temperature in the room was far too hot the air conditioner was not turned on and on a hot muggy day it would have been nice to enter into a cool room i turned on the air conditioner and after quite some time the room cooled down since i arrived in the early afternoon i decided to order room service from the nix restaurant that is in the hotel i ordered the gooey triple decker grilled cheese at i was expecting the best grilled cheese sandwich i had ever eaten when it finally arrived more than an hour later it was cold and the cheese was far from gooey it also comes with a bowl of tomato bisque soup which needless to say was also cold for the quality of the food was way too much to pay for this meal after a meeting with clients we stopped by the martini bar for drinks the waitress was rude and seemed to be overwhelmed by the amount of people she had to serve needless to say it took forever to get our drinks we heard other patrons grumbling about the amount of time it took for the drinks to arrive as well finally we got our drinks we all ordered a french martini we all took a drink and immediately all our mouths puckered it had far too much pineapple juice in it making it very very tart at each you would think it would be made to perfection far from it the evening finally over i went back to my room where i now found the temperature to be too cold due to the air conditioner not turning itself off when it should have after a miserable night i checked out glad to be done with the knickerbocker hotel
2,this hotel was an absolute dream to stay in i couldn t have picked a better hotel to spend in such luxury i enjoyed the set up of the rooms and the space they offered the room decor was extremely elegant and the location was great as well i honestly felt like i was at a spa the price was very reasonable as well i would definetly recommend this hotel to everyone i know if you ever get a chance to spend a night here definetly choose the suite rooms
3,the knickerbocker hotel is fantastic it s an old hotel with updated rooms so you get the old timey charm and fresh comfort all at once the hotel has a fabulous location it s a one minute walk to the cheesecake factory and bloomingdales and about a minute walk to einstein bagel company the best bagels and cream cheese ever macys and saks this location can t be beat you re at one end of the magnificent mile so it makes for easy strolling as you don t start in the middle and then backtrack the hotel staff are super helpful and friendly checking in and out was very smooth and the concierge cheryl was amazing she booked all our dinner reservations and activities for us and recommended an incredible restaurant called carmines which was a minute walk it was the greatest italian restaurant i have ever been to and i can t recommend it more the rooms are small but not too small we had a beautiful big samsung flat screen cordless phones a rain shower ample clean towels and beautiful marble countertops the hotel rooms have european charm to them and made me feel like i was at a star hotel in europe the beds are very comfortable and the duvet is soft like butter the only complaint i had was that housekeeping woke us up at one morning when the knocked on our door despite the fact that we had the do not disturb sign on when we answered and asked her to come back later she seemed a bit miffed the issue was corrected though and it didn t happen again during our night stay the hotel has some unique items on their room service menu ie grilled cheese with mini tomato soup for dipping very cute their late night menu however is lacking it would have been nice to see some soup on there that being said i rarely order from room service when on vacation so i really don t see that being a big deal overall i would recommend this hotel without hesitation i think we paid about a night and i would say it was worth far more than that we had a wonderful experience and i truly look forward to staying there again wouldn t stay anywhere else
3,great beds clean rooms amazing bathroom nifty view wonderful service expensive parking but it s chicago speedy in and out very european in sensibility and amenities but with air conditioning
2,staying at the swissotel in downtown chicago is not so much the typical stay so much as it is an experience not only is the hotel located in a great area to get to all local attractions but while you are at the hotel you will have many amazing accommodations at your disposal there are two gourmet on site restaurants and a lounge to relax and get great food the rooms are over sized and the beds are among the most comfortable you will ever find finally the service is award winning so anything that you do not already have at the swissotel will be at your fingertips with their assistance overall i would highly recommend this hotel to anyone who is looking for more than the typical hotel
0,i selected the talbott for my recent family vacation to chicago we chose the hotel for it s close proximity to navy pier and otherwise central location in retrospect the phrase location location location apparently does not apply to hotels it s a good thing the location was so great because just about everything that happened inside the hotel was bad upon our arrival our room was not ready the clerk could have been nicer about the whole situation and told us simply that we would have to wait without offering any sort of help with our luggage or a timetable for when our room would be ready when we finally arrived in the room the sheets were not clean a call to housekeeping proved difficult as i do not speak spanish the second day of our trip housekeeping never showed to clean the room despite the presence of our please service sign hung on the door we stayed in for some room service after a long afternoon on michigan ave when the food finally arrived a full hour after placing our order it was cold and not very good despite these poor impressions the management was unwilling to compromise on price at checkout my call to corporate headquarters was answered by a call center in mumbai they will not receive my business again
0,i recently stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel and towers and there is no way i ll be going back check in took a long time as there many people arriving for a conference and only a single staff member at the reception desk my room itself was barely passable the bathroom seemed to need a good cleaning and the room itself looked like it had seen better days long before i ever was here for the price i was paying you d think they d allow access to the work out facilities but they wanted an outrageous per day charge top it off with the small pool and no hot tub and you won t want to be spending any time here at all to top it off the promised discount rate wasn t honored at the end of my stay despite being assured that all was well at check in i ended up arguing with the manager about it when i was checking out since i had to catch a flight no resolution happened and as of yet i m still waiting for responses to my calls and letters chicago has a lot better hotels to offer and for the price per night i paid it wasn t worth it even the shula s wasn t enough to make me want to return here
3,just got back from days up in chicago shopping with girlfriends first time i have stayed at the omni i did so because i saw a rate that included of free food on travelzoo the three of us year olds all stayed in one suite with double beds and a very comfortable pull out sofa we had plenty of room food in the restaurant was great service was outstanding from everone we came into contact with early morning delivery of free coffee juice and hot chocolate was fabulous and recommendations from the staff on where to eat time of movies shopping areas etc was really helpful need i mention the outstanding location simply the best we all decided that the omni is our new favorite hotel
0,we originally made reservations for a weekend getaway but after looking at their website read about their romantic weekend getaway having never been in the area before or stayed at an ambassador hotel we really didn t know what to expect but the pictures online made it look more inviting than it turned out to be upon arriving the parking valet was on break and we ended up having to park our own car unless we felt like leaving it in the line of traffic it only went downhill from there the bed sheets had footprints on them and the bathroom had an odor that we couldn t figure out what it was we ended up getting a different room which was very mediocre needless to say we won t be staying here again
3,the only minus for this hotel is they do not provide the free morning coffee at all the other kimpton hotels it was a great place to stay for the theater but our rate did say morning coffee the robes were not in the room and it took a long time hours but other than that a great place the concierge was excellent
1,i just returned from a night stay at the hotel i had requested a high floor quiet room neither request was honored the windows are not well insulated because the traffic car horns and sirens continued all night long on the first night two drunk parties woke us up in the hallway the safe in our room did not work someone had locked it before our arrival one of the pictures under the tv had been removed leaving a screw sticking out of the wall the lights are so dim that is next to impossible to read a small alcove with a stained bench had a reading light that was about watts our room key cards didn t work so we returned to the lobby where they recoded them upon returning to our room they didn t work again and we stood there trying over and over again until finally we succeeded with no help from the staff the bathroom is small and has no fan so the steam covers the mirrors and unless you leave the bathroom door open it does not clear on friday night one small cookie was left in our room what about a second guest are we supposed to split a inch diameter cookie on sunday the phone rang with a am wakeup call we had not requested to be woken up the concierge did not know the way to get to o hare by train and gave us a longer route than was necessary i have stayed in much better hotels in chicago quieter and more spacious more elegant and worth the money this is definitely not worth a month by the way i live in washington dc and am used to city noise this was unacceptable
2,wow i have been to many hotels as a business man and have seen my fair share of garbage dump hotels but wow this hotel was great the staff was prompt the room was extremely clean and everything just ran like a well oiled machine i was particularly impressed with the fact that the front desk gives out free toiletries and other things usually i have to pay for a stupid toothbrush but not here i really enjoyed staying at intercontintental i was very worried about the chicago area s reputation of bad hotels but this turned out just great next time my boss flies me out to chicago i know where i am staying
3,my wife i celebrated our anniversary at the knickerbocker could not have been treated better before we were out of our cab our bags had been loaded on a cart we were walked into the hotel by a doorman the rooms were well appointed the entire hotel staff was very friendly this is a prime location for shopping sightseeing or nightlife
3,mostly great with a few islands of relatively minor problems first the good outside of the hotel and lobby were decorated like a winter wonderland as befitted the season the restaurant service was absolutely flawless servers who don t write orders because they are expected to remember them remember clients clearly from one day to the other and go above and beyond consistently rooms are comfortable yes the beds are great the gym is well equipped second the slightly off putting mmmhh we got the i love chocolate package which advertized bfast every day dinner once snack once and a gift and we have an a club favorite guest membership which also advertized a gift so no gift either for the chocolate package or the favorite guest membership upon enquiry the snack was the gift not at all what the package suggested that said bfast was sublime and the chocolate dinner outstanding as well some problems at checkout though we got charged for all dining despite having booked the package and it took quite a while for a polite but seemingly less than informed front desk staff to correct the problem would absolutely go back but probably not on a special package
2,my stay at the hotel monaco chicago was amazing the staff are polite and well poised eager to give a helping hand in a short notice to someone like me who had never even been in the city of chicago it really gave me a good feeling throughout my whole trip the rooms hallways and facilities were exceptionally clean and tidy and whenver i went out i would always find my room perfect be it for a night of undwinding after one of my conferences or just to hit the mattress and sleep during my stay i stopped at their restuarant where i had one of the best american style meal in a while overall the hotel monaco is a place i would surely stay at again if given the chance to visit chicago for a second time it is truely exceptional
1,stayed at the fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on tripadvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel good location but the room was dirty and not just from the last housekeeping it was dingy a place where you needed the slippers they provided and this was a suite also the refrigerator was caked with ice and didn t work furthermore because my travel agent had mixed up the dates i was to travel i showed up a day late the hotel said it wasn t a problem and that i wouldn t be charged for the no show the night before i had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day then the fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve neither i nor my corporate travel desk will use the fitzpatrick again two dots only because it s in a good location and because the lobby was clean i m generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad
0,i had an awful experience here the staff were rude and unhelpful it took forever to check in and when i did they took a while to even find my reservation when i got to the room it was marginally clean and when i complained they said they were full and could not do anything for me i would never go back they are obviously not worried about customer service
0,we booked an american girl place package at fairmont chicago millennium park told that we d have a room with a nice view apparently their idea of a nice view is of another building ended up getting a smoking room when we booked non smoking cost us more a night than we were told and staff was incredibly rude at the restaurant would never recommend coming here for any reason whatsoever
3,other reviews complain about the small rooms for a major city we found our room quite comfortable with a king bed and really nice furnishings one feature we liked is the ability to open the window the knikerbocker is a small boutique hotel right off michigan avenue in the best area of chicago the staff was friendly and helpful for the we paid on hotwire we could not have found a better room in downtown chicago
3,my boyfriend and i were amazed by the breathtaking view of lake michigan we are from texas so the view of the city was very important to us we had no problems at this hotel rooms service location were top notch
2,classy decent and serene these words clearly define the totality of my stay at the talbott hotel in the heart of chicago the hustle and bustle of the city did little to affect the conducive atmosphere for relaxation provided by this posh hotel the lounge was so welcoming and flashes of smiles from every angle the staff from the bell boy to the managers were polite helpful and responsive to my needs the room service was classy and to cap it all the beds were just as comfortable as back home making the talbott a home away from home my wife and i enjoyed the t rex experience and learnt a lot about the city of chicago and what it has got to offer believe me we will return with the kids because the talbott is family oriented and friendly to kids it felt very safe anytime we are in chicago the talbott is gonna be our home away from home
3,i travel a lot for business and quite frankly my expectations were starting to reach new lows i usually always choose w hotels just for the consistency of average hotels the affinia in chicago has raised my expectations and w hotels are going to suffer in comparison this hotel is one of the cleanest i have stayed at in some time service was impeccable friendly front desk staff and the extra towels i ordered arrived literally within minutes the gym has new equipment with plenty of space and such a fun vibe without dark hallways and loud music i have to thank the other reviewers their reviews led me to the affinia and i was so pleased my new chicago hotel it will even lead me to try the manhattan hotels
2,the swissotel chicago is a delight to visit located in downtown chicago this hotel has nine different styles of room accommodations to serve everyones taste they have children friendly rooms as well as the exquisite presidential suite rooms have exceptional views of downtown chicago this hotel also has a penthouse fitness center and pool for entertainment other places to stop by to eat is the palms geneva and the lobby lounge
2,we recently stayed at the fairmont chicago millennium park while travelling for business what an incredible experience friends had stayed there years ago but when we showed them our photos they couldn t believe the amazing renovations while we loved the modern decor and style our main reason for choosing this hotel was because of what they call fairmont pure rooms i have had so many awful allergy attacks while travelling so i wasn t too optimistic that they could actually make a truly hypoallergenic and allergy free room i have to say i felt great during our entire stay we enjoyed a delicious bottle of wine and incredible cheese and appetizers at eno what a treat to get such amazing food and wine without even having to walk out of the hotel this hotel is truly beautiful everything you would expect from a high end big city hotel our stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park didn t disappoint us in any respect our only disappointment we don t have a reason to go back to chicago anytime soon but i have a feeling we will be making reservations for another visit in the very near future
1,the room was dingy and run down it felt like staying in a cheap motel the carpet was exceptionally worn wallpaper peeling bathroom grout dingy the place felt like it hadn t been redecorated in years on top of that the windows would not open not unusual for a hig rise hotel and there was no air fan for ac or heat how the temp control was supposed to work i have no idea they said radient cooling whatever that is but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation we even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated so much for privacy i can t comment on the food because we ate out at every chance chicago has some fantastic food and much of it within easy distance to the hotel the hotel is in a good location near the waterfront and millenium park shopping and dining the conference facilities were average but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non existent i will never stay in this hotel again especially for the price because of the poor room quality
0,i was very disappointed with this hotel i have stayed in other swissotels and enjoyed them very much but the service can only be described as aloof there was no warmth during the prolonged checkin procedure and the woman repeatedly asked me to provide information i had given her minutes ago precise indeed room service took forever to pick up good sign in a way busy because they are good but the food arrived very late and very cold the man tried to replace it but than took another hour and i was never given a price reduction free dessert or anything to apologize as for cleanliness they must be next to godly as they knocked on my door at despite the fact i had a doorknocker requesting no service i m a late sleeper very disappointed with my stay this hotel clearly did not help build the chain s reputation
2,to whom this may concern my name is jamie brown and i was a recent guest of yours between july through july and your staff made my stay so comfortable i almost didnt want to leave the kitchen in the room and the complimentary grocery shopping service made me rethink leaving all together and when i didnt feel like cooking the complimentary welcome home dinner with a glass of wine helped me clear my mind for all the paper work i had to look forward to the free wireless internet access both in my room and sitting by the pool helped get all that done and helped me get my laps in as well i really couldn t have asked for anything more i felt like a queen and i never though i could feel that way just staying in a hotel i thank you so very much for treating me so kindly and i will gladly be visiting you again very soon only for more pleasure and way less business sincerely yours jamie brown
3,we brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time small rooms but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene lots of interesting amenities in the room convenient to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping really loved the lobby a great place to hang around or wait for someone lots of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere watch out the concierge like all concierges at big hotels will direct you to mediocre large restaurants where they get kickbacks we have stayed here several times and i always check for rooms here when i travel to chicago however the hotel is often full so book early
3,my wife and i stayed at this hotel at the end of may she came for the weekend for a function and we extended the trip to take in the city we got a deal on this hotel through travelzoos night stay for night plus we got the full buffet breakfast the room was wonderful extremely large king size bed with expansive sitting area we are used to smaller hotels with little room to move the bed was extremely comfortable with lots of pillows no wear or damage in room at all except sink tap dripped a bit poor taps we could have upgraded to river view for night but chose not to we enjoyed the room for what it was floor looking south the buffet breakfast was great lots to choose from and very fresh with made to order eggs non stop coffee and juice and the servers were so eager to please great to have breakfast included in night stay might be a bit dear to pay at person it was nice to sit and relax with good breakfast coffee and newspaper and not have to figure where to catch a morning meal concierge desk was most helpful in suggesting places to eat always informative and ready to provide maps directions multiple suggestions and even make the reservations cards included to admit without paying cover charges at some jazz clubs location was great blocks from el and other transportation and easy walking distance to the parks and right on the river if in chicago again would not hesitate to stay here again a swimming pool would have been nice but we did not miss it
3,hi stayed here for three nights recently from check in to check out all staff members went out of their way to make sure everything was ok and if there was anything they could do to help us directions restaurants transport nothing was too much trouble the dinner from monday to thursday was a wonderful surprise also the breakfast was more than adequet stayed on the floor and slept soundly hotel close to everything for the tourist or business traveller restaurants and shopping all within mins
0,my wife and i decided to stay at the amalfi while we visited friends in chicago we will not stay here again nor would we recommend this luxury hotel to any of our friends amalfi claims that your stay begins with a warm greeting but we received the exact opposite the front desk clerk was rude sighed and rolled her eyes anytime we asked her a question and became agitated when asked for a pet friendly room apparently there was extra work for her since we had to change our reservations and add our dog who we had to bring at the last minute the room on the pet floor was alright nothing spectacular and unfortunately had a slight scent of covered up dog urine we proceeded to dinner at keefer s restaurant and had to wait an additional minutes past our reservation time i have my suspicions we were segregated upon because of our casual attire opposed to the elegant environment that was prominent throughout the restaurant the next day i could not get the wireless in the room to work correctly and had to finish some work at our friend s house my wife had called for some extra towels and pillows which took about half an hour to receive she also ordered breakfast because breakfast in bed was her favorite until the eggs that showed up had a long black hair in them we were set to stay for days but only managed to stay we will not be staying here again
1,i ve been here for days great location right off of miracle mile near all major hotels best shopping and theatres rooms very large hotel staff very friendly and helpful and respond immediately problems there frequently are homeless people even during daylight on superior between st clair and michigan avenue the main route you walk for or all activities and just about everything is in walking distance from here at night the street on the north side of superior is dark and it usually smells strongly of several unpleasant odors the street people do not approach you although they may stare as you go by usually or more along the way where they sleep on the window sills of neiman marcus i would not think a woman would feel safe by herself i am from a large city and do not have a street people phobia there are homeless up and down michigan street but this is different as it s a lonely stretch and no open business is along either side of the street the entire hotel needs a lot of cosmetic work and apparently will soon undergo a major renovation for now expect two extremely small warm slow elevators with long waits serving floors and warm cramped hallways all the walls throughout the hotel need painting and the wallpaper is peeling in places in the room several electrical outlets were hanging out of the connection the carpets were stained the bathrooms needed new grout some mold visible the tv is very small inch and the windows very very dirty you won t get your room serviced unless you ask for it sometimes more than once the pub downstairs is run down dark and kind of creepy food and room service are very expensive as is parking day public and day valet on the plus side the bed was very comfortable there was ample comfortable furniture in the sitting area plenty of space and a decent view as the hotels spans st clair street toward the north and south you can see a sliver of lake michigan pool small but clean all in all it was clean and quiet and provides lots of space for sitting around in the room but i think it is overpriced and i would not stay here again
3,review s a little late but my husband i first stayed at the amalfi in totally based on reviews i read on this website we were totally wowed loved the location the room the aveda bath products but most of all loved the evening reception breakfast on our floor i returned to chicago with girlfriends in and booked us in a suite at the amalfi it was great room was very spacious and my girlfriends were quite pleased will stay next time i m in chicago too p s they honor a government rate
2,great hotel went for the weekend with my wife and had a wonderful time the hotel is one of the cleanest well kept hotels i have stayed at beautifull location on michigan ave downtown chicago overlooking grant park beautifull scenery great staff and wonderfull food as well i would recomend this hotel for anyone who is looking for a nice vacation or going for work
2,my husband and i stayed at the palmer house hilton in chicago for our anniversary the hotel was beautiful and luxurious as one would expect from a hilton brand hotel in a major city the service was excellent with check in and check out going smoothly the location of the hotel was ideal for us as we had plans to attend the theater visit the lincoln park zoo and picnic by the lake all of these were very close to our hotel the price was reasonable for the location and luxurious accommodations we also enjoyed the hotel restaurant and lounge highly recommend
3,my nieces and i stayed here for a long weekend we had a wonderful time we arrived early around and they let us into our room this was very nice otherwise we would have had to store our luggage and register later room was very clean as was the bathroom with women we needed extra towels they brought them up right away and then we got a call to make sure they were delivered room was also quiet construction going on behind us and we never heard anything beds comfy and so were the quilts good location for michigan ave all in all a wonderful stay would return
0,i found my stay at the hotel monaco chicago to be less than satisfactory they lure you in with a fancy website promising the world and more but their services and amenities turned out to be a facade the pictures on the website show a grand five star lobby and one would assume the rooms match but when i received my room which by the way i could barely afford i found it to be no more luxurious than my local motel they mention that they are pet friendly let me tell you that is code for smelly there was a faint urine smell throughout the entire hotel and i was awake all night because of the incessant barking would not stay again
2,great hotel the staff is friendly corteous and professional they made me feel like i was a returning guest which i was not but i will be the rooms were very clean and i slept well in the comfy bed they have a complimentary workout deal with the nearby healthclub that i took advantage of several times since it was to cold to run outside my only issue was the battery for the tv remote died however a call to the front desk remedied that situation in about minutes stars
1,we stayed at the james hotel for a birthday the location was excellent for shopping and restaurants but also very loud the room was horrible very small we had a double double and it was the size of a college dorm room plus completely white walls and linens absolutely no color except for one accent pillow it was very sterile and uninviting we were on the floor and the lobby for the elevator was dark and done in red and balck with minimal lighting it looked like the entrance to hell if not a haunted house staff was very nice and accomodating i would not return to this hotel
2,for a short time during vacation i had rented a room from the ambassador east hotel i have to say i was quite impressed with what i experienced and would referre others looking to stay in a hotel to that given location the hotel is comfortable and spacey with nice staff who are always polite to aid you whenever it is needed and trust me i am not the nicest person in the world so this says a lot the food is good location is great everything is easily accessible and all the given luxuries of a hotel are well kept here
1,i was scheduled to stay at the hard rock in june but had to cancel i had booked the hotel back in january when i called six days before my arrival date to cancel i was told that i would be charged for my stay because i did not cancel seven days in advance i told the customer service rep that i had never heard of such a practice but she said in a very smug manner that i was told back in january i honestly don t remember being told of the cancellation policy but think it is a unprofessional practice to capture some additional dollars since it is not an industry standard to require a seven day cancellation policy when you book directly with the hotel i for one will never stay at a hard rock hotel and will make sure that my friends and business associaties know of this unfair practice
3,just returned to seattle after a visit home to chicago and i loved the james recently stayed at the ritz at water tower and the dana around the corner both of which were great but the james was perfect secured the room through a package w american express for a great deal so though the view wasn t great the space decor and location can t be beat staff was friendly courteous and very helpful the gym was substantial and though i didn t try the restaurants room service the menus looked yummy i ve stayed in chgo in that area on avg mo over the past three years and the james is at the top my list now if you can get a good deal i highly recommend
0,do not stay at this hotel a friend and i booked a night stay one weekend when we were visiting a friend in chicago though it was a bit pricy we decided on the knickerbocker because it was in a great location and the rooms looked large and well kept our flight was delayed so we arrived a few hours after the designated check in time however despite calling the hotel in advance to notify them of our delay when we arrived they gave us a hard time and we had to wait an hour until we were allowed up to our room the concierge and manager were both extremely rude to us and made it seem like we were a huge inconvenience to them by arriving so late to top it off the maid service was terrible the only thing they seemed to do was make the bed no vacuuming no fresh towels etc we didn t want to stay the third night but were forced to in order to avoid a ridiculous cancellation fee this hotel is way too much money for the services they provide you d be better off staying in a motel
3,i love this hotel it is one of the best that i have stayed in the lobby was beautiful and the room was nice and comfortable the made services was terrific no matter what time we left the room it was made up when we came back i asked the maid for a couple of extras and she was very nice and friendly that is what i liked about the hotel the staff was so nice and friendly i was there with my daughter for a girl s weekend from thursday sunday everyone from the doorman to the concierge to the people at the desk etc was wonderful i can t say enough good about this hotel yes the bathroom was small but i wasn t moving into the room i was just staying there a few days and was hardly in the room anyway i will definitely stay there again
1,will not stay here again we were here pre construction so didn t have the noise problems that others are now experiencing but room and service quality were so poor that we will not return our suite was large enough but it was dirty dated and worn the bed linens were stained and the bathroom did not appear to have been cleaned properly public hall areas had room service trays sitting for two days disgusting we politely requested housekeeping to touch up our room and pick up trays and they never showed we had paid for the king tut package which was supposed to include tickets to the exhibit they had no record of this and didn t honor it of course the exhibit was sold out so our main reason for visiting chicago was ruined as we weren t able to see this part of the field museum my also polite letter to hilton and the manager was never acknowledged very very disappointed in this property and am now avoiding hilton in general when possible
3,the omni chicago really delivers on all fronts from the spaciousness of the rooms to the helpful staff to the prized location on michigan avenue while this address in chicago requires a high level of quality the omni delivers check in for myself and a whole group of people with me was under minutes the staff had plentiful recommendations for dining and events and the rooms are some of the largest you ll find at this price range in chicago even the standard room has a separate living area and work desk the fitness center has free weights weight machines and two rows of cardio equipment i shared the room with others and did not feel cramped in any way all in all a great property
0,i had really high hopes for this hotel the location seemed great and the prices were too unfortunatley you get what you pay for despite being located near the miracle mile and navy pier there weren t many other redeeming qualities the staff was very rude we arrived late after a long drive from detroit and found nobody in the lobby to help us check in once we finally got checked in our room hadn t been cleaned and there was trash left over from the last people we were told the cleaning staff had gone home for the night and they couldn t get to it until morning we had planned on seeing some of chicago s attractions like the field museum but we could hardly find anyone to help us out with where to go their website advertises lots of specials and packages but we found absolutely no way to purchase them finally when we checked out they had charged our room an extra cleaning fee because the cleaning we requested on the first night ridiculous
2,we stayed at the millennium knickerbocker last week and it was really wonderful first off the staff is excellent all of our needs were addressed quickly and with a smile the hotel really was the perfect launching pad for us to take in everything that chicago has to offer all of the shopping of michigan avenue was just steps from our room we decided to go for the shedd aquarium package we started the day with a really wonderful breakfast at the hotel and then thoroughly enjoyed our all access pass to the aquarium very cool after our long days of sightseeing and a quick stop at the wonderful martini bar it was so nice to come back to the room which was elegant but a very comfortable sanctuary from the busy city to top it all off they have the most incredible shower that i ve ever used and even better it s all green what more can i say the millennium knickerbocker was a huge part of what made our vacation so wonderful and memorable i highly recommend it
2,when you enter the lobby at the millennium knickerbocker hotel you immediately see that this is a special place where you are going to be pampered the staff are very friendly and helpful and seem genuinely happy to assist you in any way they can the check in process is smooth and friendly as i expected when you enter your room the decor catches your eye luxurious yet not stuffy is how i describe it the restroom tub is large and made of marble the whole room is tasteful and made to make you feel special yet at home i highly recommend the millennium knickerbocker hotel to anybody looking to escape for a while
3,this hotel was perfect for our girls getaway the decor is fun refreshing loved the roof top bar every staff member was friendly always smiling the location is perfect for michigan ave shopping the beach dinner and night life it was a mile or two from millenium station the concierge recommended a couple places to hang out after dinner and added our names to the guest list i m sure they do it all the time but still a nice gesture
1,the hotel itself was beautiful and wonderful staff but the bottom line for me was that it was impossible to sleep through the night because the noise of the ambulance sirens continued throughout the night for three consecutive nights there was simply inadequate soundproofing even floors above the street ok floors as there is no floor i hesitate to write this review but i rely on trip advisor reviews when traveling and had i been warned about the ambulance sirens i would have chosen to stay elsewhere if you are a sound sleeper and noise is not an issue then it is a lovely hotel and excellent value conveniently located wonderful staff but quiet is a key priority for me so i would not stay here again
2,great hotel went to see the museum of contemporary art which was great but this hotel almost had it beat the rooms and even halls are very beautifully done great service too a
3,we just returned from nights at the ambassador east what a gem the location in the gold coast neighborhood is perfect for finding restaurants and walking the magnificent mile there is a train station about blocks away the room was very comfortable with nice amenities and there is free internet service on the floor best of all was the bell and lobby staff they really went out of their way to be helpful and greeted us warmly each time we left and arrived i would say that this was the nicest hotel staff i ve encountered in all my travels
1,i have stayed at this location many times over the past few years and have enjoyed the neighborhood cost and amenities the hotel is currently under construction and while they claim to be open you wouldn t know it you need to take an elevator to get from the street the lobby and the rooms are bare lacking even an alarm clock the beds are propped up on a modern bed stand but you might think that you are in a stale mental asylum and not a nicer historic hotel i will try them again once the construction is through but would recommend staying at any other hotel in the meantime it was a very frustrating experience
2,this is a beautiful hotel inside and outside the rooms were very comfortable and clean the hotel made my experience of visiting this city even more wonderful i highly recommend this to anyone
1,not a good start when the front desk isn t willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room we reserved a king suite and the hotel put us in a queen suite without telling us up front only after we confronted the manager did they come clean about the switch he offered us a free breakfast but would not up grade our room the whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the omni we will not be retuning to this hotel again
2,i really loved my stay at the talbott my room was amazing the bathroom and i am very picky about hotel bathrooms had ample room for all of my stuff which is a bonus for me the staff treated me really well and they were very friendly i was afraid that i d get a little lost since it was my first trip to chicago but the staff helped me navigate to the downtown area rush st michigan ave which are very close by the hotel reminded me of those i d stayed at in europe the room service is hours which for me was a bonus because i am up mostly during the nights this is the only place i will ever stay if i visit chicago again for a single woman traveling alone to a strange city this hotel made me feel very safe and comfortable
2,my husband and i visited the fairmont chicago millennium park for our honeymoon the customer service was amazing from the time we booked our packege to the time we checked in everything was absolutely amazing these people were proficient respectful and very thoughtful the fairmont had a lounge a wine room a bar and a restaurant i couldn t decide where i wanted to go first after we put our bags up we headed down to the wine room it was totally delicious we also got free wine just because it was our honeymoon then after a few glasses of wine we hit the spa once again excellent everything smells like honeysuckle and everyone smiles all the time we stayed in the gold room although it was a little bit smaller than i thought it would be i was definitely satisfied with the huge king bed with even bigger pillows my husband and i relaxed in fluffy white bath robes while we sipped champagne while we watched the sparkling lights of the city it was a wonderful experience that i will never forget four thumbs up
3,i stayed for four nights while attending a conference the hotel is in a great spot easy walk to michigan ave shopping or rush st but just off the busy streets the room i had was spacious and very well appointed the staff was friendly and the fitness center while not huge was well equipped and clean i ve stayed at a number of hotels in chicago and this one is my favorite internet wasn t free but at for hours is cheaper than most business hotels and it worked very well
0,i have no idea why this is considered a four star hotel the omni chicago s age shows and not in a great ambiance way the rooms are dingy and just plain worn looking i say rooms because we had to switch our original room as there was a terrible musty odor almost like mildew that permeated the first room we were given seriously it brought tears to my eyes the staff seemed rather indifferent to our dilemma but finally agreed to switch us to another room the new one didn t smell but was clearly past its prime housekeeping was almost nonexistent we had to call them back both days of our trip to empty the trash and for towels how can you forget to leave towels for the guests i m not one to complain but for the kind of money we spent for a weekend here we were expecting at least a little luxury and special treatment we received neither and will not be returning to the omni chicago
0,i recently stayed at the swissotel chicago with my husband and two children while the room was comfortable i did not think that it was the best choice of hotel for those with children the main reason for this was the dining while the in house restaurants had children s options there were not any other dining options that were a bit more informal anyone with children knows that you don t want to take them to a sit down restaurant at certain times this was especially true since we were traveling we arrived at the hotel with tired children in hand and wanted to eat a quick meal and then put them to bed however our only real options on location were these fancy restaurants this was certainly not the most family friendly of options for a hotel with a kid friendly package
2,the conrad chicago was by far the best experience i have ever had in travel leisure not only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable but the food in the restaurant was exquisite not to mention the perfect service from the resort s employees i was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs i m naturally a fitness freak so i was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the floor best of all it was available to guests at any time day or night the resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area so it wasn t a far walk to scope out the shops the most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous chicago looks all lit up it was so relaxing just watching the city come to life i was very disappointed when i had to pack and leave any time that i make my way back to chicago you better believe i will be staying at the conrad chicago i recommend this resort to everyone i know who does a lot of traveling
3,this was one of the best hotels i ve stayed at in chicago i ve also tried amalfi and a number of larger chain hotels downtown this one was the best great service beautiful room roomy bathroom top notch amenities
1,we ve stayed here before but this time around was a marked difference in quality and service the staff wasn t rude just incompetent for example we ordered wine glasses for the room because the hotel no longer services a mini bar in the room which seemed like a really cheap way to go for this type of hotel nonetheless the staff brought us coffee mugs the list of issues goes on unfortunately including the low grade in room movie options our audio and video did not sync on our rental we eventually had to stop watching after minutes and the room itself was not clean the bathroom sink vent holes were black with mold clearly the hotel has pulled back on not only amenities but training or sufficient staff oh but the price point for this hotel has stayed the same find a newer hotel there are many in this great city
2,i stayed here with my family when we were in chicago on a family vacation all i can say is wow a fantastic experience all around first off the hotel is magnificent the lobby entreway is jaw dropping to say the least everyone we dealt with from the desk clerks to the cleaning staff to the doormen were all exceptionally cordial and friendly the rooms themselves are fantastic perfect for a business person there for a stay or for a family there for recreation the new serenity beds that the hilton offered were to die for one of the most restful nights sleep i have had in years the kids loved the ipod docks in the rooms and my wife and i loved th fact the kids could keep their bedroom ice cold like they like it and we could keep it warmer in ours as usual it had wifi which was ultra cheap and very very fast over all i highly recommend the palmer house hilton
0,i stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower hotel a couple of weeks ago while in chicago for nights i must say i was not impressed this is an example of a hotel that tries too hard with little result except for inflating your bill to start with the hotel lobby was totally gaudy it had sculptures and artwork that seemed meaningless and i guess was supposed to give an air of style the room was ok i suppose but certainly not worth the premium price i paid for it the hotel food was presented like it was some kind of amazing french cuisine but the food while arranged nicely tasted unremarkable and again was overpriced my final verdict is avoid this hotel if at all possible it is simply not worth it
1,as i sit here in my floor room at the hotel allegro i listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left she seems to have a cough today in the room on my right someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit i hear the water running and the toilet flushing i also hear footsteps in the room upstairs even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms i ve stayed in about a dozen kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst the room is dirty the carpet covered in spots and stains the curtains with a large brown stain i don t want to guess what it is paint peeling rips in the wallpaper the decor is a bit garish with pepto bismol covered walls green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet the size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable but i m so glad i had earplugs to avoid listening to others toilets flushing all night the location is good for downtown theaters or business only three elevators serve this storey building and they run very slowly chicago has many nice hotel options many i ve enjoyed quite a bit unfortunately this is not one of them and even more unfortunate for me i m stuck here for two more nights i was looking forward to staying here because most kimptons are hip comfortable and attractive this is not
0,my wife and i stayed at the ambassador east hotel last month for my son s wedding when we got there nobody helped us with our bags and they took forever to valet our car after waiting minutes to get my car parked he expected a tip which i found rude after finally getting to our room i noticed crumbs on the floor and a dirty bathroom i was extremely disappointed with the room and the service i will not recommend this place to anyone
2,my husband and i stayed at the hyatt regency chicago to celebrate our ten year anniversary we could not have picked a better locate the price of the hotel was really affordable for a couple on a tight budget the flat screen television and the comfortable beds were a favorite of mine my husband loved the stetson steakhouse and the hour stay fit gym we really did not leave the hotel during i stay there because basically everything you need is only a walk or phone call away if we ever travel to this area again this would be my first and only pick for a wonderful stay this hotel gets four thumbs up from my husband and i what a wonderful ten years celebration
3,i was completely blown away by this hotel it was magnificent i got a great deal and i am so happy that i stayed here before arriving i was nervous as i had read a few bad reviews about the impact the renovation was having on peoples stay for example very noisy however whilst the renovation was still going on and the gym was not open nor the restaurant it made no difference to me my room was huge bathroom was spacious with excellent water pressure bed was perfect and the view was amazing hotel is so close to the great shops of magnificent mile plus a comfortable walking distance to hancock tower and millennium park
1,what s not to like problems getting the room you actually reserved i had to call this hotel three times and email four times in order to insure that we actually got the room we had reserved overcharging they charge for everything here wireless the fitness center the business center i ve only run into one other hotel that ever charged for use of the fitness center note to the intercontinental if you re going to charge for something that is commonly included you should advertise that fact what s next charging for sheets on the bed very poor customer service the staff does not communicate in full sentences or wait to hear your answer this is chicago not new york how about a little midwestern patience
3,hotel monaco is in a really great location only a block away from the miracle mile and a couple of blocks from millenium park sears tower is also well within walking distance and if you don t mind walking you won t have a problem walking to greek town and lincoln park we did the daily complimentary wine hour is a really nice touch that we unfortunately were only around once to try out if you can leave your car behind you won t need it and the parking is quite pricey which is not very surprising considering the location everything was clean fresh and modern and the staff very helpful the only bad thing was that the noise from the elevated train around the loop was quite loud and that our room happened to be next to the maid s supply room so it was quite busy in the morning
2,i must say this hotel is absolutely beautiful my wife and i were blown away by the penthouse fitness center and pool all the way up on the floor very well designed rooms with great linens and pillows the bathrooms were a nice change of pace from the boring hotel bathrooms we usually see overall an excellent experience here great views and close to everything you could want to do in chicago
1,i would not recommend this hotel although it is in a good area the room was very small and is getting rather dated the room had extensive damage the paint on the bathroom ceiling was peeling the wallpaper in the bathroom was peeling the wood work in the bathroom looked like it had been chewed on there was mold and stains on the bathroom tile the room was very small there was not room for a sofa just a small faded chair and ottoman the carpet had stains on it also the bed was comfortable but there was not a top sheet just the bottom sheet and a comforter overall i was not satisfied with the hotel for the price that was charged i have stayed in other hotels in the area that provided much more space cleanliness and value for the money paid
2,my recent stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park was everything i desired and more for my luxury shopping weekend in chicago i loved the contemporary style of the rooms complete with modern conveniences like a inch flat screen television and ipod docking station i appreciated the walking distance to all of chicago s premiere shopping areas the concierge was extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations while the bellman was excellent at providing me with private car service the services i received at at myspa were some of the best in the world dinner at aria restaurant was delicious in short fairmont chicago millennium park was the perfect luxury vacation meeting all my needs and more
1,very disappointed in our stay in chicago monoco we have stayed many times elsewhere primarily in washington dc and are accustomed to great customer service beverages like water or soda at the wine bar coffee and papers in the morning help with bags not only did the chicago monoco do none of these things the staff was not helpful either requests were not honored and the staff did not seem happy to be there you got the feeling you were bothering people if you asked a question no bellman the doorman did not open the door or help with bags even though we were traveling with a child i had to request a fish when they did not bring it really baffling as we love the monoco in washington
1,my family has dubbed the omni in chicago fawlty towers because there always seems to be something wrong this time our room was right above the kitchen and the odor of cooking grease wafted through our bedroom all night long it smelled like a greasy spoon restaurant and it permeated all of our clothing the bedroom window was bolted shut so we couldn t get any fresh air into the room with the amount that the omni is charging for a room they should have a much better ventilation system
0,whilst no doubt being in a good location this hotel falls short in other areas most notably is cleanliness as although the lobby was very clean the corridors of my floor as well as the room was not dust lined the carpeted floor for the hallways and in the room the the bed emitted an unpleasant odor as if the sheets had not been changed in some time the furnishings were nice and modern but with various blemishes upon close inspection bathroom was relatively clean with the exception of the shower view was nice for this particular room and service was relatively quick the food in the restaurant was average but again cleanliness was an issue this time with the glasses which were stained the waiter promptly apologized and returned with new glasses but this is still inexcusable in what is advertised as a high class hotel i will not make the mistake of staying here again
1,i never write these reviews but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the travelers choice terrible service lazy doormen bellmen concierge valet lack of respect allow dogs to bark all morning after multiple complaints phantom charges to room front dest at checkout and checkin were pompus the icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son and the doorman watched on doing nothing me and my girlfriend are young look young in how we dress but in all honesty make more money than most and we were treated like cheap poor kids i had dinner reservations at spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up the concierge exclaimed that you know its not jeans and running shoes right mr blank assuming i was too dumb to realize that a star person restraunt wont allow tennis shoes because i am young very dissapointed very nice looking comfortable beds great room service contemporary younger crowd but service was terrible
2,it was my first time to visit chicago and i would say i d definitely go back not just because of the air and water show that we really enjoyed but most importantly because of the hotel that we stayed in the millennium knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests but with pets too at first i was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog but i was surprised it turned out the other way i ve experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and that s really frustrating it s just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly i would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit chicago
1,swisses chicago nice but lacking in some pretty basic expectations in our modern era in a great spot along the chicago waterfront a spacious room is a comfortable respite from the city but don t plug in your computer or hope for a free donut in the morning no free wifi here or affordable breakfast or a free swim in the pool just a ten dollar a night charge for internet an on average plate for breakfast and another bucks a night for the fitness center i ve stayed in small town no star motels where wifi is free as part of a dollar room get with it this is no free breakfast is not so bad as you probably ate too much for dinner and don t need it anyway but for those of us who aren t charging everything to the company card some basics would be appreciated coffee milk oj stale donuts muffins maybe some cereal throw us a little something besides fruit flavored water in the lobby with regards to swimming this is another one wrapped up in a fitness center fee but the pool is only open till pm plan accordingly this all makes the fiji bottled water in the room seem like a bargain summation drop the fees the nickel dimming of folks and just charge what you need to charge to compliment what is otherwise a nice hotel
2,my friends and i were in chicago last month and were looking for a resonably priced hotel in a decent neighborhood well we came across the hotel allegro and immediately fell in love everything from the colors the staff the architecture and the pricing were amazing we couldn t have found a better hotel the service was impeccable talk about a star hotel for someone with a star budget my friends and i plan on staying here next year when we return i can t wait until then
0,i stayed three nights recently at the hilton homewood suites downtown chicago overall i can t rate this establishment highly the person at the front desk was disorganized and took over minutes even to find my reservation once i finally got my key the desk person just thrust the keycard at me like she was happy to be rid of me it didn t get any better when i got to my suite the bed was poorly made and i found a couple of long blonde hairs on one of the pillows the room was very stuffy and i swear might have even had a vague pet smell my shower was not very clean notable hard water stains on the shower door and the bathroom sink had a small continuous drip also the carpets didn t seem fresh and even had high traffic dirt noticable i also visited their small gym workout area and was disappointed there also it had limited equipment that was in poor repair the floor in there was even slippery which made it a definite trip hazard while the indoor pool looked good as i dipped into it the water felt a bit slimy and did not have a good smell all in all the amenities the unfriendly service and the sub standard cleanliness makes this hotel one i would definitely not recommend to anyone when that is paired with their sky high room rates it s just not a place that should earn any repeat guests
1,this is my letter to the management sir or madam i am writing to give feedback about our recent stay the amalfi we were a guest from to during our stay we used the valet service operated through standard parking our vehicle was returned with stolen items from the glove compartments much to my chagrin day valet service did not include proper security monitoring despite the premium over self park i understand that these parking services are sub contracted by the hotel but i would think that any worthy hotel would remedy the situation this was not the case i hope that your staff will be able to take measures to rectify the situation for future guests
3,we usually stay at the sofitel but thought we would try the conrad for a change i don t think i would rate this hotel over the sofitel but it was still class but i do think the service was better at the conrad we arrived at the hotel just before the restaurant closed and soon we were the only table left normally service goes down hill then but our waiter eric was the best even when i kept ordering my after dinner ports the meal may not have been the chop house but it was still very good the bar was ok no crown reserve they did have the cask at a drink ouch the room service was very quick our room was very clean and the maids replace everything including the ashtrays during their visits the only fault we could find was the temperature on the floor it was so hot that we had our window open the whole time with the heat turned completely off which wasn t so bad since my wife smokes the temp on the where the lobby bar and restaurant was fine we enjoyed the hotel enough that we will be back in sept one last thing if you like a cheap fantastic breakfast go to the west egg only a few blocks away
0,this hotel was full of drunks the lobby was full of crowds at night and the bar was way too busy there were people stumbling all over the hotel at all hours of the night yelling in the hallways making lots of noise the staff had little to say i wasn t aware of the noise level when i booked the room and when i threatened to make other reservations the people in the lobby had nothing to say we asked for a water view and got a city view again the people at the front desk weren t accomodating at all overall we had a horrible experience
0,the intercontinental chicago magnificent mile the outside of the hotel itself is as the name says is pretty magnificent despite being set in what has to be the filthiest section in the city for the cost of the rooms starting at a night you would think they would have a competent parking attendant i was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room and if that was not enough to top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account i would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations
3,i actually booked this reservation with the hotel over the phone and got a great rate much lower than the usual price it was a lovely hotel beautifully appointed walking distance from the places we wanted to go we would highly recommend the fairmont
2,best hotel in an excellent location i stayed at the sofitel chicago water tower with my husband and kid as he came there for a business purpose my year old kid was jumping on the bed and he really enjoyed the atmosphere of the room the front desk people were too welcoming and the staffs were very friendly the room service was also good the room was very clean and the bathrooms are so good i like the decor of the room the french restaurant in sofitel is so good and we both enjoyed the dining i will surely prefer to stay in sofitel on a next time travel to chicago
1,i was looking forward to staying here for my wedding in late september and was surprised by the signs of hard times that were subtle but affected me and my husband for example he got locked out of our room times once having to wait for minutes in the hallway after going to the spa the other time was when he was getting ready for our wedding ceremony so that was stressful because he lost some time the keycard just would stop working then a fuse blew so we had no power while trying to get ready it happened to me also coming back from the spa and i called on the hallway phone to get help luckily right after that an employee who was randomly walking by asked me if i had been waiting long as if she knew this was a problem i said no and she called down to check apparently no one had even called security to get me back into my room she had a set of keys and let me in thank god then on our wedding night my husband wanted to order from room service it was a little after we were told that room service was closed for the night even though all the literature in the room brags about hour dining that fact was never communicated to us when we checked in i feel like the quality of service and amenities are slipping we later heard something about a lot of employees getting laid off so maybe that s why people weren t too intersted in providing good service i don t think if i would recommend that anyone stay at this fairmont nor will i ever again btw the spa is great to hang out in even if you re not doing a massage
3,the hard rock hotel is great for a relaxing getaway the rooms are quiet the bed is comfortable and the bathroom is a nice size we had fabulous service and got a great rate other than the fact that there were no bathrobes it s listed as an amenity and the sony radio didn t work it was perfect would definitely stay there again
2,during a recent business trip to chicago i had the pleasure of staying at the hotel allegro the lobby gave a good first impression it was a very clean with a modern designer s feel and the customer service was great i proceeded to the counter to check in and within minutes i had the key to my room i was told to check out the infamous restaurant but i was tired from my flight i checked into my room the room was great a king size bed flat screen tv and standard desk all designer furniture after i unpacked i had to check my email hooking up to their wi fi was quick and painless i had a good night sleep and early wake up the next day for my business meeting i decided to try the restaurant for breakfast i had an omelet and fruit the restaurant was great and the food was perfect i only wish i had more time to stay and enjoy lunch nevertheless duty called the concierge had my taxi waiting for me right after breakfast and i was off to work i would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting chicago it s one of the best i ve ever stayed at after multiple business trips
0,i recently stayed at the palmer house hilton on a business trip to chicago i will do my best to make sure that future employees of my company do i have to stay here when the reservation was made an early check in was arranged due to travel arrangements my travel companion and i were to get to the city in the early hours of the morning we had arranged an early check in without having to pay for the night before there was no fuss raised when we agreed on this and so we assumed it would be fine when we got there however there were no rooms available for us for hours and they refused to keep our bags we were forced to change clothes and wash up in the public restrooms of the office building where our first meeting took place and cart our bags around with us they offered insincere apologies and didn t offer to comp us anything for the inconvenience the rest of the stay one night was nothing to praise i guess not having bugs would count as positive i would definitely never recommend that anyone stay here
3,stayed at the chicago hilton for three nights and from the minute we walked through the door i was very impressed check in was quick easy and i was very glad that we were able to check in despite being earlier than the advertised check in time we were given a twin room with two bathrooms which was brilliant it made getting ready to go out much quicker the hotel location is great opposite the park which is a must see although located on south michigan ave it is easily within walking distance of all the shops and sights of the whole of michigan ave would also recommend the street one block back from michigan ave for good shopping for breakfast i would recommend grabbing a muffin croissant or bagel from the bar just past reception rather than going for the more expensive breakfast in the restaurant for evening entertainment kitty o sheas is a must typical irish bar with good drinks and live music finally the bed at hilton chicago is the most comfortable bed ever i would have taken it home if i could definately made for a good nights sleep
3,my wife and i stayed at the ambassador east hotel for the first days of our honeymoon in mid october we decided to split our honeymoon up and stay in two different hotels so that we could experience different aspects and areas of chicago in a week i ll start out by saying that this was a great experience at check in i indicated that we were on our honeymoon and were upgraded to a suite the ambassador east is probably a to minute walk from the north end of the magnificent mile it is also just a or minute walk to a lot of great restaurants and bars on rush our room itself was incredibly spacious and well appointed our suite on the floor had two very large closets a large living room and a large bedroom the bed was incredibly comfortable and the bathroom was nice enough if i would have payed full price for this suite i probably would have given it a rating of but because the staff was so kind and because my wife and i had such a great time here i decided to give it a five it is also worth mentioning that the concierge was very helpful my wife and i decided to eat at the pump room restaurant but we were not very impressed we found the food and service mediocre the atmosphere was probably pretty neat when sinatra used to eat there back in the day but not anymore although we were unimpressed by the pump room the staff were kind enough to seat us in the sinatra booth which was back in a corner and enclosed by curtains that neat experience was really the only redeeming value of our meal here the ambassador east is an older hotel but it is in a charming older neighborhood the staff s kindness and overall charm of the hotel itself really impressed my wife and me when we are in chicago again we will definitely consider staying at the ambassador east again
3,stayed for nights at the james wonderful location mins walk to michigan avenue with all the shops staff here were all incredibly helpful and genuinely friendly nothing was too much trouble rooms are huge and the beds the most comfortable i have slept in room was very clean had separate seating area with sofa and chairs with a flat screen tv there was a bar area with stereo mini bar and coffee maker there was another flat screen tv in the bedroom area bathroom very good with complimentary shampoo conditioner shower gel and body lotion hotel is also pet friendly there was even a large bowl of iced water and a barrel of dog biscuits at the front door of the hotel pets even had their own options on the room sevice menu
3,we have stayed at several high end places in chicago and this is still our favorite location is superb staff are particularly gracious and welcoming without being cloying cornell at the front desk is unfailingly helpful as is the concierge we love the extra room that a suite provides and if you join the frequent guest program high speed internet is gratis as is a breakfast beverage delivered along with the newspaper each morning at the time of your choosing bedding is of excellent quality and they offer truly amazing blackout curtains we have never had a bad stay at this hotel
3,as we pulled away in a taxi heading to the airport for our trip home my wife turned to me and said we picked the right place having chosen the talbott from other trip advisor reviews i found myself thinking in terms of a trip advisor review when we arrived nice entrance friendly reception i noticed everything and immediately knew the talbott was a non corporate warm hotel with touches not typically seen in big name hotel chains the smell of the elevator and attention to decorative details strongly reminded me of europe simple not overstated but elegant the location is great there was light snow but we walked to the art institute rush street the theater district and we re from california where anything below degrees keeps us inside all i can say is if you are the kind of traveler that wants comfort class and somewhere unique stay at the talbott oh yeah we were in a room that looked down at the construction we were on the floor and could not hear a sound it was very quiet
1,we reserved a room with a sleeper couch a few weeks before our stay after checking in and unpacking we discovered that the sleeper sofa had been removed supposedly during renovation the front desk clerk and bellman never mentioned that there was no sleeper sofa even though they saw all of us check into the room colleen one of the managers was argumentative and did nothing to resolve the problem we ended up having one of our children sleep on the couch and the other slept on an antiquated rollaway bed we never spoke to the general manager who was conveniently absent from the hotel during most of our stay we stayed here on more than one occasion over the past decade and had never encountered such incompetence we had to make several phone calls to receive a miserly discount and we never received an apology the lack of training of the staff was clearly evident as was the cavalier attitude of the management
1,the good location views decor room service friendly staff the bad shower curtain in replacement room was too short and leaked bed was just ok the ugly had to pack our bags again and change rooms after loud noises from the elevator kept us up i am a heavy sleeper but even with my white noise app cranked on the hotel s ipod dock it was still loud enough to keep me up also our toilet leaked into a puddle by the shower the staff did however provide a replacement room although not immediately also they mentioned that they had aready been aware of the noise problem with that room from past customers
1,elegant lobby comfy beds nice sheets but we were given a not fancy a little dated room on the floor which had a view of the monstrous venting structure and was located off the lobby so we heard the elevator all night at the hilton one is charged for internet access on each device per hour we stayed in the middle of ohio and received total access for free we didn t drink the water or try the breakfast buffet the staff was friendly but of course you tip for a smile they did give us a cot for free as we had asked for a room with a fold out couch as we were a party of didn t use the gym or pool on the floor but looked nice small pool no view of the water possible though we were right at grant park we tried to view the fireworks from a higher story no such luck read more
0,on a recent business trip to chicago i had the unfortunate circumstance of staying at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel upon entrance the lobby is beautiful and the hotel seems very nice however as i approached the check in counter the woman working there was very terse and rude to me they had me booked in the wrong kind of room and when i asked about changing it i was snubbed and made to feel like it was a tremendous imposition for them to accommodate me after a half hour i finally received the correct room the linens on the bed were of a very cheap quality they were scratchy and had a musty smell also the bathroom wasn t cleaned properly as there was still trash in the waste basket including a condom and there was no shampoo also i had a coffee pot in the room but no coffee when i called the front desk to ask for some they told be it was not free and would i like to charge the coffee to my account i found this hotel to be shocking and highly recommend that no one stay there
2,i stayed at the millennium knickerbocker hotel for a fun weekend in chicago the standard room had a nice king size bed that was nice and comfortable i love a hotel with all white sheets because then i know it s clean i really liked the simple and modern decor especially the huge upholstered headboard nice fixtures in the bathroom and granite counter the bathroom was so much nicer than my own bathroom at home the staff was friendly can t really judge the service because i didn t have any problems or complaints so i didn t have a reason to interact with the staff much overall it was a very nice hotel in a great location will definitely stay here again on my next visit
2,the hyatt regency chicago is a wonderful hotel me and my husband recently stayed there on a summer vacation and it couldn t have been better the staff was very polite and helpful and the rooms were very clean and they had some of the best beds i ve ever slept on not to mention the view was amazing if i had to rate this hotel i d definitely give it five star next time i m in town i will most definitely stay there again
1,first let me say i try not to be too critical but in some cases the truth is warranted we checked in and things seemed fine location was excellent woke up the first morning to a slightly rumpled bed covered in stains i hope filthy and not star hotel quality requested a linen change and heard a knock on the door a gentleman was there to let me know if i wanted it done to take off the privacy sign i did and no one even came until later in the day the room was big enough had no drawers suposedly remodeled but carpet didn t reach the wall toilet paper holder fell off constantly and shower head was broken the mirrors were great and the water was always hot the walls were paper thin i heard every conversation the guests next door had they were not noisy but you could hear everything including the t v through the walls and vents internet was worked for a bit and then not again i called customer service and spent minutes on the phone and they asked if they could work on resetting the system and call back later the hotel did give us a credit for the charges at this point enough was enough we packed our bags and checked out the front desk was very helpful kudos to rocco for caring and being the only friendly staff we saw other than the bell hops
1,this hotel has a great location and very friendly staff however the physical condition of the property has certainly fallen behind the competition i use to be a regular at this hotel but have not been back for years rooms have not been well maintained old carpets frayed at doors wall paper peeling off of the walls tv s from the s there is currently construction going on in the lobby area making it impossible to get to the restaurant without leaving the hotel and walking to an outside door
1,i live in chicago and have frequent occasion to recommend hotels to friends and business acquaintances we recently put up a candidate and his family we were recruiting for our company at the conrad we had had good luck with this hotel when it was a le meridien it was a disappointment for all concerned as a conrad on the plus side our guests were able to check in early with no problem and they generally liked their room on the downside they learned after the fact that all rooms with two beds have no bath tub only a shower our guests moved to a room with a bath tub and found hairs in it which they had to clean themselves when the coffee bar had no caffeinated coffee and our guests asked for some they were told it would be delivered immediately when they called minutes later the front desk admitted that they had forgotten while the concierge and doorman were quite helpful our guests told us that the front desk personnel were sullen and unresponsive our guests were generally under whelmed by one of the five best hotels in chicago conrad has a long way to go to compete with the four seasons peninsula and park hyatt
2,when i first booked my reservation at this hotel honestly i didn t know what to expect i mean i m kind of a music person but this was my first real experience with a musically themed hotel upon staying here however i am convinced that i made the right choice in my stay the dining accommodations were excellent and i was served probably some of the best food i ve ever eaten at a hotel it was intelligently placed in downtown chicago and i wouldn t have to walk too far to see some street performers or just take in the majesty of the city itself the room i had booked had an excellent view of the skyline and i could ve easily sat for hours just marveling at the city sprawled out before me the whole hard rock and musical aspect of the hotel was just the icing on the cake of my stay if i had to stay here again i would
0,i recently visited chicago i stayed at the hotel allegro chicago first of all i did not enjoy the welcome as i checked in to the hotel my hotel price was off the roof and i only used it to sleep and eat breakfast the food served was not up to par i felt like it was a cheap free lunch my room was crowded and my waste baskets did not have bags in them my toilet paper row was half way finished when i checked in i felt that the house keepers gave us dirty looks as we went in and out of the room i did not feel safe i had to hide my valuables and i kept the busy sign on the door so no one would enter and take stuff the rooms did not appear as they do on their website it is actually the opposite looked to me like a regular motel inn but i paid way more than i would have at an actual motel inn i did not appreciate that none of the electrical outlets worked and my phone was dead for my whole duration of the trip i would not recommend this hotel to anyone
1,we booked our hotel stay thru yahoo and requested a room for with beds when we got to the hotel not only did they not have a room for us we pre paid but they said they could not guarantee what we had requested online they could only give us what was available the hotel staff was rude and condescending and only after i got upset did they finally tell me they did have a room for us if you book online beware you may not get what you paid for they did not stand by their promise they advertise in each room
1,i can easily say this is one of the worst hotels i ve stayed at the the receptionist up front was a snooty sarcastic teenager or post teenager you can get better service from a waiter or waitress at a diner the room was dirty stains on the carpet the showerhead was moldy and rusted the doors of the bathroom and main door all had dents and scratches the towels had a horrible aroma the hotel is very narrow so we were near a construction zone so i would plan on waking up at am if you choose the talbott the next day i asked for another room and the concierge who was a decent guy moved us to a larger more comfortable room that room though was right by the elevator and it was torture hearing the sounds of the elevator which just would never stop i asked for late checkout at and the receptionist refused stating that we would be charged for a half day if were not out by noon i had to speak to the manager who gave us till please stay away from this hotel i think a holiday inn would be better andrew f gulli
1,me and my husband stayed in the allegro hotel chicago for days nights recently we got a room with a king size bed although the room is small we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages all however we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us the walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound of the days our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign the worst is upon returning to the hotel at night we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage the housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins this is unacceptable to us the hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night although it is near the cta trains i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view am staying again at a kimpton hotel in san fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change overall not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to chicago again
3,i stayed for just one nite at the sheraton hotel and towers and was a little nervous after reading a few negative reviews from other ta posters but i was not let down i got the room via pl and was first placed in a room on the floor with a fabulous view of the roof of the lobby and a parking lot since i had nothing to lose i asked to be moved to a room with a view the front desk attendant rasheeda wanted to make sure that the room i had at first was clean and was in order and i assured her that it was she then moved me up to the floor with ease and it took about minute i was quite surprised as i have heard that they treat pl and hotwire folks with a little less love than full price customers the new room was very clean and spacious and overlooked the navy pier a few other skyrise condos and the beautiful infinity of lake michigan all this for yep i skipped room service and walked to the local gourmet market as suggested by others and it was pricey but all food there was delicious the room was comfy had an ample closet and room to breathe as well as a convenient internet connection location i didnt use it since i wasnt staying that long but at least it was on the desk the bed and pillows were very comfy but i awoke at about in the morning sweating from the comfy but very warm and somewhat weighty duvet on the bed this was a great deal for the price and i would absolutely stay here again
2,my husband and i stayed at the james chicago hotel for our anniversary this place is fantastic we knew as soon as we arrived we made the right choice the rooms are beautiful and the staff very attentive and wonderful the area of the hotel is great since i love to shop i couldn t ask for more we will definatly be back to chicago and we will for sure be back to the james chicago betsy m louisville ky
1,i have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is probably the worst service that i ve ever experienced the staff was unaccomodating and the hotel did not provide the services that it claimed it would i decided to try the monaco because it seemed interesting was close to the theater and had what seemed to be a good rate what a huge mistake the front desk staff was condescending and not even remotely helpful the room was not clean the gold fish we had requested came many hours after we told them we would be arriving they never bothered to come turn down the beds and the late check out priviledges which were guarenteed when i booked the room suddenly became upon request boy the extra minutes they gave me sure were helpful dont waste your time or your money here at best it s nothing special personally i like the fairmont in chicago but anyplace woudl be better than the monaco
1,we booked the amalfi looking for a great boutique hotel in chicago the hotel is a nice property with clean rooms and nice amenities in a good location however when i booked the hotel i was offered an upgraded room from a king room to a corner king room for only more that was great until i checked in the corner room looked at two brick walls and an alley during the night there were several homeless individuals fighting in the alley it would seem that this is a place for them to congregate on top of this the dumpsters in the alley were being emptied by the waste department between and am in the morning the noise was crazy loud i think this is a nice hotel with some unfortunate aspects due to its location the staff is extremely friendly and very helpful
0,my wife and i stayed at the affinia chicago last week in a studio suite which was not worth the extra payment it was an absolute nightmare to begin with the room is listed as oversized when it s nothing of the sort we ve previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about square feet smaller i believe the only extra space was in the closet which isn t very useful unless you plan on living there we had our two sons with us so we had to make extra sleeping space our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time complaining of bugs moving around he must have been umcomfortable also as i sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock the room service is horrible they took minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around and she had to wait up for that my family would never go back to this hotel and i highly recommend you also stay well away
0,my husband and i stayed in this hotel for what was supposed to be a romantic weekend it was far from that we could hear the television in the neighboring room and when we called the front desk to complain the person who answered the phone was extremely rude we were unable to relax at all also the room was not very clean there was a definite smell of cigarette smoke and the bed was as hard as a rock we will not be returning to this awful place
2,my stay at the palmer house hilton was wonderful i was attracted to this hotel because it was going to be me and my finance s first time in chicago the location of the hotel was perfectly placed downtown chicago we took advantage of the hilton bed and breakfast special upon check in on friday afternoon we went to the lockwood restaurant before going to the room for the weekend we stayed in a one bedroom suite with a king size bed the hotel was spotless i have never been in a hotel room that was so clean the portions of food was perfect and everything they provided was on point i would recommend this hotel for anyone who is going to visit chicago for the first time the staff is professional and let you feel like a king and queen
0,we booked a room at the hilton chicago for two nights to stay the weekend but upon arrival our reservation could not be found i even provided the hotel with our confirmation number but it still wasn t available fortunately another reservation had not shown up so there was space available for us once we settled into our room for the night after a long flight there was a bad odor coming from the bathroom apparently the cleaning solution they used was tainted and they had to re clean it after our arrival needless to say with both of these poor experiences in just one night i will be hesitant to ever stay in this hotel again let alone any other hilton around please consider someplace else before the hilton chicago
3,well located and well staffed the amalfi was a clean and comfortable place to stay it lacks a restaurant or bar but many are near by free continental breakfast and evening cocktail
0,when i walked into the millennium knickerbocker hotel my first thought was wow this is very yellow and not the good kind of yellow like a sunny day no the ugly yellow that you would want to wash off your pretty white blouse my room was fairly descent although the yellow theme seemed to leak in it was a victorian feeling in the lobby that turned into a modern feeling in the rooms and bathrooms i would have liked to see less yellow and maybe a bit more of that fancy feeling from the lobby in the rooms
2,sofitel chicago water tower is a four star hotel that is minutes aways from the magnificent mile navy peir the museum of contemperary art lake michigan and upscale boutiques this hotel is great for tourest it has great rooms and high end sweets it has a modern diesighn and rich arcitechusall legacy it has great food and out door dinning it also has a great veiws while drinking wine and champane cotails in there amazing bar overall this hotel is by far the best hotel ive stayed in
1,while overall a decent property the incident i had with this hotel has been like none other in my history of travel i recently stayed at the hotel monaco for five nights checking out on monday march shortly after leaving the hotel and retrieving my car from the valet my partner and i noticed a large scrape on the bumper of the car that wasn t present upon checking in we had not requested use of the car for the duration of our stay i called the hotel approximately two hours after checking out and was directed to speak with the garage manager at park one their valet company who stated that he would review video of the car and call me back within hours to verify that the car was unblemished upon arrival and was scraped upon departure from the garage the garage manager mike yunan didn t call back until i had an email exchange with the general manager of the hotel marco scherer when he finally got back to me the garage manager stated that he would file an incident report and claim with his insurance company travelers which would eventually deny the claim because garage staff wouldn t admit fault or liability nor did they supply the video they stated they had of the car entering or exiting the garage which could have verified that the damage wasn t present upon check in but was at check out their insurance representative even told me that the garage does not have surveillance at that location contradicting the garage manager in the end this kimpton intouch guest got stuck with a bill for parking at this kimpton property an almost paint scrape on top of a per day parking fee rental car expenses several hours of lost time in dealing with the issue and one gigantic headache in the end do not trust the valets or staff at this hotel and take your business elsewhere if at all possible
1,we stayed at this hotel in february the room was great we had purchased it at a raffel at work for a fund raiser for united way so we probably paid more then we needed but it was for charity we were woke up at in the morning by a group of at least young people that were so loud coming off the elevators and down the hall ways they must of woke everyone up on our floor of course one of the rooms they rented was right next to ours they were so loud shouting profanities and banging on the walls that we thought there was maybe a fight going on we called the front desk who sent security up immediately security tried to get the people that were not registered guests to leave we called down to the front desk two more times to send security back up again since nothing changed this went on for over an hour until it finally quieted down because of this we ended up over sleeping in the morning since we were so exhausted when we complained about it in the morning managemnet would do nothing for us because as they stated we used a gift certificate well we still paid for it they would not give us one thing free for the trouble that we had we would never stay at this hotel again obviously they really don t care about their guests
2,located right in the heart of downtown chicago i visited this hotel on a business trip the first things i noticed was how friendly the staff is and how clean the rooms are even compared to other luxury hotels seeing as i had a night layover before my meeting i decided to stop by the terrace and get a drink i got a mojito and i must say i was very impressed i ve had my share of mojitos and it was one of the better ones once i retired back to my room i found the sound system to be excellent bed was soft and the tv didn t appear burned out at all overall i give this a five out of five the staff was helpful and friendly the whole time and the atmosphere was perfect i wish i could have stayed longer
3,i have been times in chicago and i have stayed in different hotels this has been for much the very best option the lobby the warm of the receptionist the room the hotel is very good it is walking distance to the magnificent mile and there s no chance for you to get lost from this hotel if you like to travel with style this could be a very good option
2,we chose to stay at the hilton chicago because it was in such a centralized location everything that our family wanted to do in town was located so close what i didn t expect was for the beds to be so comfortable i can t remember when i got a better night s sleep the staff was very friendly and the hotel grounds were impeccably kept we ll be returning to the hilton chicago the next time we re in town
0,i was extremly unhappy with my recent stay at affinia chicago when i arrived to check in my reservation that i had made and confirmed weeks earlier was not in the computer i had to wait minutes in the lobby while a room was being cleaned for me the whole time the desk clerk gave me dirty looks and texted non stop on her cell phone while the office phone rang off the hook i had no toilet paper in my restroom or trash can in room i ll never go back dont waste your money
2,i stayed here for a weekend while visiting some friends in town it was a little pricey but definitely worth it the staff was super friendly the pool was clean and well maintained and they even had a really good veggie burger in the restaurant downstairs i m a vegetarian plus i paid for a room with a lake view and it was gorgeous i would definitely recommend
1,i expected a glamorous room and i walked into a disappointment housekeeping and management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel if you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms doesn t go down past the closet is wide all old dirty brass fixtures beds that are a little bigger than a twin showerheads that barely put out water then this is your hotel i might be spoiled by staying in marriott s but i stay in hotels of the year and was severly disappionted no free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again
3,everything that i read from other reviews was pretty much on the money they have excellent customer service the employees there really cared about their guests there was always coffee tea hot chocolate in the lobby good hot breakfast and dinner with wine and beer the doormen were nice and willing to help out for directions the room did the job there was a kitchen flat screen tv s and a pullout couch included it was close to the el but for us we found the buses to be more useful i would recommend getting a pass we got a day pass and it was well worth it for which we got at jewel osco not too far from the hotel for the most part the majority of the people that were there were older people on a business trip and families but us three girls didn t mind so i would definitely recommend this place it was one of the cheapest places were found out of all the other hotels
0,your website wowed me enough to book online although i had never used your hotel i had high expectations when visiting your hotel with my family on our recent trip to chicago and i was very disappointed the first problem was that there was not enough staff at the desk we had to wait a long time to get checked in when we finally got to the room the beds were unmade and cleaning supplies were in the bathroom the maid hadn t finished the room and she d left her stuff behind of course we called the desk right away and got a new room but it was a huge hassle the next problem was the dog of the person across the hall and down one we knew this was a pet friendly hotel but we envisioned well controlled non barking pets this animal barked repeatedly when my kids were trying to go to sleep i called the desk twice and eventually the barking stopped i think the dog just gave up because it didn t sound like the desk staff knew what to do the crowning disaster at least for my kids and husband was that the remote control for the tv was dead we managed to get that taken care of but it was just the icing on the cake your hotel looks great but actually being there is not great i cannot recommend it to anyone
3,we just returned from our first trip to chicago and stayed at the omni i read many reviews on trip advisor and picked the omni based on its wonderful reviews and they were right on the location staff rooms amenities etc were all wonderful huge thank you to ta members who suggested signing up for the preferred member program we did that before we left and received complimentary beverages in the morning and newspapers among other perks i loved being woken up to fresh orange juice and the chicago tribune newspaper we were in room which was perfect corner suite with two out of the sides of the rooms being windows with a great view the room was huge with a gorgeous king bed and great living area with plasma tv the bathroom amenities were wonderful i loved soaking in the tub with the mineral salts that were provided the turn down service was great as well we would come back to our room with relaxing music playing and our bed ready for us we ate at their restaurant twice and the breakfast buffet was delicious the blueberry muffins were the best i have ever had everything was so fresh and prepared perfectly the staff at the omni is so accomodating everyone is always smiling and asking you how your stay is have to thank the concierge melissa and curtis they were both so helpful with great dining suggestions and maps for everything we wanted to do i also used the gym during my stay and it was great all the machines were top notch and each treadmill has a lcd tv attached and the gym itself had two plasmas they also had cold lemon water for you after your workout i am a stickler for cleanliness and it was sparkling every morning it really was a fantastic stay at the omni and we would never stay anywhere else i also wanted to mention we never heard any construction while we were there everything was quiet and we both slept wonderfully on the big comfy bed thank you trip advisor for another great trip suggestion
0,the pictures on this website sure are deceiving in real life the palmer house hilton is not nearly as pretty as its made out to be the cleaning staff was still there when we arrived at our room and they made us wait outside while they were still cleaning now granted it was only minutes and sometimes guests can be messy but i thought that was the only weird thing i would have to put up with on that trip it wasn t they charged us for a mini bar fee when we don t even drink no one told us that we would have to pay for liquor anyway they also did not get our wake up calls to us on time so we missed our tour bus and almost a whole day of our trip we had to spend extra bucks on cab fees just so we could see the city in the way we d planned and then it wasn t as good because the tour guide wasn t there and we got lost my husband lost the key to our room at one point on this trip and the desk gave him a hard time about getting a new one it was terrible i certainly won t be staying here again
1,we stayed in the amalfi in july of july weekend i was very apprehensive about leaving my diesel ford excursion with the valet at amalfi it has a few modifications to the engine and can be damaged if not operated correctly i explained the procedure to the valet drivers and felt like it was a complete waste of time when the vehicle was returned to me the valet driver did not let it idle down and cool the turbo off as i had instructed when i tried to start it it wasn t happy but did finally start i was so relieved to get it back i just wanted to leave driving away i noticed that the top speed recorded on the gps was previous top speed was done a few days earlier driving across south dakota i could just picture the flying ferrari scene in ferris bueller s day off i couldn t imagine where in the crowded chicago traffic they found a place to go that fast though it wouldn t take long to make that happen see reference to modified engine above a little while later we stopped for lunch and i noticed a dent in the front bumper i contacted the hotel and was referred to their claims people no remedy lesson learned brett
0,my wife and i stayed at the conrad chicago hilton a few weeks back i had a conference in the windy city and my wife decided she d come along to do some shopping first off let me say typically i love staying in hotels any chance i get i ll spend it away from home in a comfy hotel bed that said this place was terrible the room had a slight odor to it kind of a fishy smell the people at the front desk were rude to us and i found a soiled pair of women s panties under the bed gross not to mention that once we got home we both had bug bites up and down our legs now we re worried we brought bedbugs home with us if i could take this trip back i would what a terrible place shame on you conrad hilton shame on you
0,i was unimpressed by the quality of this hotel the overall look of the place was marred by what felt like poor maintenance given that this is supposed to be a luxury hotel and charges rates at that level this was most disappointing nor was i impressed with the snooty attitude taken by the hotel staff
2,this hotel is beautiful it is very modern and has a very luxuary feel to it the location is wonderful it is close to magnificent mile and the navy pier which was a great place to show the children on our vacation we had the option of private parking which made a feel secure with our car and the valet was very nice and helpful i also take my work with me everywhere i go so the wi fi at the hotel was a plus they have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing this place is great for the price due to the looks of the hotel you will be surprised at how affordable it is this is very nice place and it gives you a feeling of being the queen or king for the duration of your stay
1,attended a wedding in chicago sofitel is new humming very very modern w hotel style minimalist and a great location however i miss the basics of a less trendy hotel we checked in at pm and our room wasn t ready when they gave me a key the maid was still in the room making it up for me i had to wait in the hallway on the weekend i came back for a nap at about pm after vacating the room at am and it still wasn t made up the housekeeping line was never answered so had to call front desk to get someone to make up my room also called housekeeping for a new hairdryer and they never brought me one i gave up this is a hot youth hotel but for my next visit i think i d prefer some of the classic amenities likely timely housekeeping a somewhat larger room that you can walk around and a less trendy hot loud clientele i m over
3,had to bring my new puppy with me on a business trip and stayed at the palmer house the service was wonderful staff was very friendly towards dog owners even stopped to tell me how nice my dog was easy access to red line from midway valets were prompt at retrieving car they recommended calling down in advance we did and the car was there waiting
3,we have just returned from nights at the conrad chicago everthing about the hotel was excellent wonderful room and service from all the staff was first class great view from our room the hotels location is great right in the centre of the magnificent mile a wonderful stay in an amazing city was made perfect by our stay at the conrad
0,when i first checked the hotel s website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there but i was totally disappointed once i got there first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that then when i was trying to enjoy the view they windows were all dusty and dirty so i decided to get out of the room and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww its all i can say about this hotel
0,on my recent weekend stay at the fairmont chicago millennium park hotel i was very disappointed i chose this hotel after scouring various hotel websites in the area from the look of the website my expectations were above average i felt the website led one to believe it was upscale upon my arrival i checked in i was shown my room and at first glance everything seemed fine with the room as i was settling into the room i began to notice a general lack of cleanliness i noticed spiderwebs in corners and a lack of cleanliness in the bathroom also it was advertised that there was an i pod docking station in the room however it did not work and i had to call down for them to bring a replacement i as a guest should not have had to call down these items should be checked to ensure they work properly before a guest checks in i found the restaurants on site to be crowded loud and not to mention an unusally long wait to be served my meal i did inquire about a few of the menu items and my waiter seemed to have a lack of knowledge about the menu items overall my experience was not good and the next time i am in the area i will chose another hotel for my stay
1,we stayed at this hotel with our two teenage daughters duing a part business part family fun trip in july we were very impressed with the location within walking distance to great restraunts and shopping inlcuding water tower place a great mall we were quite disappointed with the room cleanlinees and size the bedspreads were filthy and so thin the room decor is in dire need of an upgreade the bathroom had no fan and it really smelled badly of mold and mildew the shower actually had mold in the corners this was a very tight squeese for people especially the bathroom the beds and pillows were quite uncomfortable even the elevators were tiny and could barely fit people thank goodness there were a few elevators luckily we booked this room on priceline and would have never paid full price the only upside was the great location also beware its cheaper to take a taxi to the airport than the airport shuttle millenium promotes the airport shuttle but take a cab
0,since this was our first visit to the windy city we wanted to stay somewhere that was central and unique we read many great reviews regarding the kimpton brand so we gave it a go the go ended up being a no go we were sorely disappointed when we arrived the ladies at the front desk were very nice we have two kids with us so we needed a crib for our month baby we were told no problem unfortunately it took them about or hours to get us the crib and we were in a lurch as to what to do next then we noticed a bug or bugs near the fridge area yikes we called downstairs to complain and to be switched to a different room or floor our request was met about minutes later by this time we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions we almost wanted to throw the towel in customer service was so lacking we wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city but had to wait around for our new room and the crib this is not what we expected at all for this high price will have to think hard before we book with a kimpton hotel again
1,this was the time that we have stayed at the hyatt regency chicago the first time was far above our expectations for a per night room the rooms are very nice and the beds are comfortable this time we got a great rate through travelzoo night for a room with a view we were aware of the parking per night the first night we got there the valet was yelling at us and said that we couldn t park they were full we had no clue where to park at this point and had to drive around for over minutes looking at closed parking garages it was a saturday evening finally found a spot and were told that it would be this was blocks from the hotel mind you its outside and we have luggage to carry too not very good service for a star hotel we got inside and apparently they were running a nightclub out of thier lobby its called the harddrive that s cool and all yes it was very noisy but once we got to our room it wasn t an issue the hvac controls to our room were broken the first night we were ok but by the second night it was blazing hot in there degrees so hot we couldn t sleep it was miserable they sent up the engineer and he determined that there was definately a problem and opened our window floors up it never did cool down enough in there we kept that window open all night it was below that night and the window being open didn t help they would not put us in another room either at checkout monday morning our bill came to after taxes for the room we then had a second bill in which our internet and parking was billed on for cool i got my reciepts and went on our way on wednesday i was on my online banking checking my account to find that hyatt charged me and another charge of that is almost more than what the reciepts from checkout say i was furious so i called the hotel nothing was resolved by my phone call they treated me as if isn t but something you wipe with she said give it another day or two and see if the additional authorization falls off that didn t settle well with me but what could i do i waited its friday now i check on my account again and the charges cleared as they should have with the correct original amounts and they still have authorizations on the two incorrect amounts as well they have charged me an additional im so furious and guess what hyatt doesn t care they gave me the same line as they did wednesday save yourself some hassle and don t stay at this hotel unless you have extra money for them to play with
0,my husband and i were really looking forward to spending our anniversary at the conrad hotel for the price we were paying we were expecting a luxurious hotel with all the amenities unfortunately it was quite the opposite upon arriving we were greeted by a rude and incompetent receptionist not only could she not find our reservation due to the fact that she kept misspelling our name but she refused to apologize when she finally did find them and acted as if it was our fault she couldn t spell our room turned out to be okay except for the stain on my pillow case which ruined the experience for me we ate at the restaurant on site and were less than impressed with the food it was alright but nothing out of this world we felt we could have gotten a better meal elsewhere all in all the conrad was a big disappointment to both of us
2,hard rock hotel is a must to visit no matter what city your in hard rock hotel is the place to stay filled with fun and unique traits to the rooms and dining this hotel is the place to be great views in every location especially chicago the service is incredible along with the food and decor the hotel staff will help you feel right at home no better than home
1,first let me say the front office people at hotel monaco are wonderful and the location of the hotel was just what i d hoped there are some other problems the furnishings are quite rundown and housekeeping wasn t very helpful we booked a suite and the sofa bed chair and coffee table in the living room area had all had some very hard use i ve attached pictures so you can see the considerable gap in the sofa and the lack of pillows comfortable it was not the chair bottom is all broken down too i invited one of the assistant managers to view our furniture and a slight adjustment was made in our rate as to housekeeping we had ordered an in room coffee service which kimpton s web site says is there but you have to specifically request and at no time did housekeeping leave us coffee we had to call the front desk every day and housekeeping neglected our fish and on our next to last day we found it floating dead at the top of the fish bowl i had requested water be added to the bowl when i noticed it going down and my note was disregarded these things may not matter to you but if you plan to spend a week like we did you might want to be comfortable the bedroom and bathroom were superior just the living room was bad
3,we visited for my birthday we had never been to chicago so was not sure where to stay found the deal on this hotel from travelzoo great rate staff was awesome very helpful and nice location was great enjoyed our stay but still like nyc better great great hotel would stay again
0,i stayed at the affina chicago for my anniversary the hotel is in a great location but that doesn t make up for the poor customer service and rudeness of the staff it looked like the cleaning crew forgot to vacuum from the last guest since there was hair on the carpet i spent more money than i would normally hoping for a luxury experience and left very unsatisfied
1,just returned from the james hotel after staying at the park hyatt i have stayed at most chicago hotels pennisula four seasons the ritz fairmont etc had heard a little about the james and the primehouse at the james we paid more for the room at the james then at any of the above mentioned hotels what a disappoitment the room we stayed in had double beds the toilet broke and overflowed the tub didnt drain while showering and the huge bathroom door that was almost too heavy to close broke several times the closet had no door but a curtain to close and no drawer space for clothes at all the room was very small and non descript much like staying at an ikea but without the color windows to outside terribly dirty and the elevators dirty and small the staff however was top notch and exceptionally helpful and friendly the room had a huge plasma tv that was nice there is no way this hotel is star yet the room rate close to a night was way of of line we paid more here than any of the above mentioned hotels the rate should have been about half of that
3,the staff recognizes you by name with excellent eye contact the welcome back sets the tone for your stay flowers in the lobby and reception area beautiful the house keeping staff is terrific helpful and prompt room service food was served hot and that makes a big difference too pump room food was surprising tasty and impressed my clients well done
3,i arrived at the sofitel for a joint leisure and business it is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable the rooms are spacious great beds pillows and linen the bathroom has a great shower and bath wifi works really well and the desk is large the staff are wonderful the location is great for shopping spa s starbucks and hairdressers i loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it
0,my husband and i recently stayed at the conrad chicago for three nights a thursday through saturday let me say we were less than pleased with our experience we chose to stay in the king bed deluxe room and for an average of over three hundred dollars a night we were sorely disappointed with the accommodations upon entry the room looked as though it had not been cleaned thoroughly the rug looked dirty and there were crumbs or something on the dresser the room was size was average and again for three hundred dollars a night we were expecting a almost suite type room the major annoyance was how loud people were we came in after midnight each evening and long after we went to bed we could hear people coming down the hallway yelling and running that is totally unacceptable for a supposed high end hotel you can expect a loud guest maybe once but every night is ridiculous the service was also extremely sub par we had to wait minutes at check in because the girl at the counter was too busy talking to another employee about what she was going to do after work one day we put the no house cleaning sign on the door and a maid literally walked in on me she completely disregarded the sign did not even bother to knock and just unlocked the door and came right in it scared me and i m just glad i was not getting out of the shower or changing so to sum up we will never stay at the conrad again we will never recommend it to anyone else and for the money there are a hundred much better hotels to stay at in chicago
3,this hotel was great in a great area right downtown and close to everything the daily happy hour had great food wine and premium liquors the free breakfast was even better actually i believe everything was included breakfast happy hour business center wifi our room was a king size facing the back of the building really clean new and comfortable small touches such as books and cds to enjoy made the room feel less like a hotel would highly recommend
0,i was very disappointed with this hotel the front desk clerk was rude she was on a personal call and took mins to get off the phone when i arrived in the room the bed wasn t made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty i called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignment on the twelveth floor once downstairs the clerk treated me as though i had done something wrong when i arrived in the new room i found the bathroom less than clean there was hair all over the floor toilet and shower the shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror my allergies started to bother me immediately upon entering the room so i checked the filter in the air conditioner which looked like it had never been cleaned the comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum while waiting on acceptable room i went to dinner which proved to be as bad as the rooms the lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy the steak was rare and i asked for medium not to mention it tasted like rotten meat the veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry to top the whole experience off when i went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a day hospital stay
1,this is a tough one to review as the star ratings were from star to and had to figure out an average is where it was here are my tips and props complaints room star i had a corner suite the room was pretty nasty actually stay away from it there was a constant banging noise from above when i first got in i thought it was the person above me bumping and grinding after an hour i knew even if it was someone high on speed and redbull would not be going that strong well the sound continued on for days not that i minded too much as i keep things on for white noise but it sure would bug others also there were about cig burns on the carpet and sofa in addition it looked like someone left the iron on the sofa also there is a gray furry pillow on the bed that looks like a big dead rat i could not imagine all the dna left on that thing either gags bathroom nice size but not great the faucet was lose really lose and the toilet would not flush right service great everyone i encountered did a great job making me feel welcome good stuff food i had meetings there so experienced the breakfast and lunch they made it was really good much better than most hotels bar very cool good music great service and good drinks the scene was decent as well small bar but was not cramped so maybe other rooms are nicer well hell they better be regardless if one room is like that especially a suite i have to think others are like that as well it is too bad though the views are great and they actually have windows that open big shocker for the city in general
3,from the moment i stepped up to the front entrance my luxury service began i enjoyed every minute the fairmont the king room was spacious and the decor chic the coffee maker was the coolest and the bathroom is huge i really like the separate shower tub and separate door for the toilet the desserts and cheese spread at eno so yummy before the fairmont the w hotel was my favorite chain of hotels to stay at
2,the hyatt regency chicago is one of the most beautiful hotels that i have ever stayed at i stayed there for days and two nights my room had an amazing view and was clean and furnished beautifully the staff was very kind and very helpful the concierge staff was kind and helped me to find enjoyable things to do in chicago overall a beautiful hotel in a beautiful city
3,nestled just off the beaten path and about two blocks from the river the fairmont chicago offers an excellent location to operate as home base for your trip to chicago the staff were friendly and helpful arranging many of the sightseeing events we enjoyed while in the city there are many attractions withiin easy walking distance the art institute is a must see and millenium park is a fun visit the architectural tour by river departs a dock that is very close to the fairmont and there are lots of restaurants nearby the rooms were excellent and the club room is worth the extra expense we would definitely stay here again
2,if you are ever going to visit chicago and need a place to stay i recommend this hotel this hotel made my stay in chicago one that i will always remember the rooms were very big and luxurious everybody was friendly and showed a fabulous display of customer service the room service always got there when they said it would and it was nice because it was hours so i could get anything whenever i wanted the price of this hotel for my stay was unbeatable especially because i got great service and i saved a lot compared to the rates of other hotels in the area and their two restaurants were exquisite if you are ever going to be in the chicago area and need a hotel to stay in i recommend this hotel
3,my boyfriend and i decided to stay at the conrad chicago for our anniversary the second we walked in we were immediately won over by the look and feel of the room white luxurous bedding on the king bed plasma t v subroofer surround sound speakers my boyfriend was more impressed than me as i reminded him that we didn t come to chicago for the hotel room very large bathroom w tub and separate stand in shower granite countertops his her robes and slippers the view wasn t great but we were on the floor and not really high enough to see anything but the side of the building next to us not a large room by any means but again we didn t go to the city for the hotel room it was the prefect size for the amount of time we were actually in the room we got a great rate on it at hotels com but i think the going rate is usually closer to mid s i ve stayed in quite a few hotels in the downtown area and none have ever impressed me more than this one we will definitely be staying there again on our next trip into the city
0,i stayed at the sheraton chicago hotel for a business meeting and had an absolutely horrible experience when i arrived exhausted after a series of delayed flights i was told that my room was not ready not ready at are you kidding me after waiting in the lobby for minutes i was finally called over to the desk only to be told my king room was changed to a room with two queen beds fine whatever i get up to my room and unload all of my bags only to find my a c doesn t work i call down to the desk and the clerk tells me that they are sold out and there is no where to move me but she could discount my rooms no apology nothing im exhausted and deal with my degree room when i went to check out the next morning i find out no one even bothered to apply the discount again no apology i have never received such poor customer service in my life and will not be comming back
1,while it was a nice hotel but i am rather frustrated with them during our stay our room was cleaned twice by housekeeping the first day was fine second day my diamond earrings came up missing noticed they were missing while in the packing up and checking out process my biggest mistake was not staying there and dealing with this further but we had a family reunion and funeral to get to while the front desk was great and said they would handle it i believe they say these things just to get you to go on about your way we filed a police report and the gm of the hotel is supposed to be working on it we have called several times but receive no answers they keep telling us the cleaning staff have been there years that dosen t matter to me if they are not held accountable what s to stop them from taking anything there is a dishwasher in the room and they found my daughters ring which was in the same glass with my diamond earrings in the dishwasher they say i put the cup in the dishwasher first i am on vacation trust me i m not doing dishes second why would i wash one glass and leave the other dirty dishes in the room so while it is a nice hotel lock up your things of value they may come up missing and you ll be left frustrated
1,we stayed at the swissotel for a three day weekend and were disappointed to see the construction when we arrived is it just me or is this information not clearly stated on their website a giant tarp where a lobby should have been was pretty weird and unwelcoming the room itself was fine more bland and generic than the european elegance claimed on their website the lack of hot water was definitely not fine though there were a couple pluses to our stay at swissotel the location is good the bed was comfortable and the room was clean these few good points certainly did not redeem our experience and i wouldn t pick this place again even post construction
2,the sheraton chicago hotel and towers is my favorite place to stay in chicago i travel to chicago very often to visit my son who is training for the u s navy they make every stay feel like a luxorius vacation the indoor pool and sauna are amazing and i never have to miss a workout because the gym is fully equipped if you dine at the lb bistro you must try the eggs benedict the staff are friendly and the prices are very reasonable for a hotel of this stature
3,we just returned from a girls shopping sight seeing trip the palmer house was like home away from home the hotel is undergoing renovations but we did not notice any inconveniences or hear any noise from the work the lobby was breathtaking all dressed up for christmas the staff from check in to housekeeping was very welcoming and friendly our room was updated with two beds and two separate baths which was great for everyone to have their own personal space i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone chicago is a great town
3,i was apprehensive after reading some of the more negative reviews of the hotel allegro however our stay there was without problems and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful the room was not huge but there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into one another the bathroom was small but well appointed overall it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased others have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway one other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and i can t even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe the area is also very close to public transportation we used the trains exclusively and got around quite well without a car we would most definetly stay here again and recommend it to others
