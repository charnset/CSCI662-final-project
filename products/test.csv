0,buyer beware these new journey releases are reissues of their remastered releases they are not remastered in rhino should be ashamed of itself for this it s been years i would have gladly paid for a remastered version but not for new packaging
1,having read this book as well as barnet schacter s on new york during the revolution both works i find are flawed in different ways the likeable thing about gallagher is that he manages to convey the story in less than half the time the hard thing to realize about the battle of brooklyn is that it really wasn t much of a battle the author here makes some grandoise statements about a new age of citizen warfare being ushered in with the advent of this battle if that is so then the complete defeat of washy s army bodes ill for that development gallagher is on better ground when he provides a nice overall of tactics and warfare in the century he gives a good account of training and recruitment in both armies one of the more interesting things he mentions is that due to the two rank line used by both sides in the revolutionary war casualties from musketry and artillery tended to be light this is an interesting point and one not brought out by many historians of the period in europe stronger lines of and sometimes ranks were employed which provided greater strength but also more density hence increased loss from fire a point well worth considering when looking at the battles of the revolution most historians miss this completely or are not interested in it gallagher provides more of a military history in general on this subject but he does waste a lot of time with preleminaries more than half of the book is spent providing the standard background for the causes of the revolution etc while certainly required for the general reader when a book is as short as this one is it seems almost pointless when we get down to the battle itself gallagher gives us not much more than schacter does the british flank march completely compromises washy s position the outlying forces are swept away clear and simple the confusion of command between putnam and sullivan no doubt made a bad situation worse washy s complete lack of strategic perspective shows up totally here the defense of brooklyn much less manhatten itself was a foregoon conclusion washy was mad to consider defending brooklyn much less manhatten in the first place he committed his ill trained army to an impossible task that he did not lose completely was due more to how the british under howe chose to wage their campaign most american authors try to put a bright light on what is essnetially a dark canvas at brooklyn the americans ran period a few units stood their ground in particular the marylanders but no one else really did the reason why american losses were not greater was because they did run some authors try to say that british losses in killed and wounded were greater than americans at this battle this is true partly because the british had to attack some strong positions that held for a time until pireced by the assault british losses were often greater in this regard because americans usually ran once the british bayonet began to strike home still of the casualities sustained by the americans here more than most us historians care to admit fell to british musketry and bayonets the british loss was still well below as the great maurice de saxe said in his memoirs of warfare in this period more of the enemy can usually be despatched when he runs as opposed to when he stands to reserve fire until the enemy line breaks was considered the most effective tactic of this period in that respect many dozens of rebels must have been shot down as they ran before british bayonets gallagher provides some understanding why the british did not storm the heights right away this has often been one of the major criticisms of howe s victory why didn t he follow up after marching all night to outflank the americans the british were disorganized and tired they had also foght a running battle with a fleeing enemy howe did not believe his army was in any condition to storm brooklyn heights memory of bunker hill or no of course this does not explain why it was not done the following day if we look more closely at howe s position we can perhaps explain his rationale his commission was both a general and peacemaker he wanted to convince the rebels to come back into the royal fold he could best do this by showing how futile their resistence to the crown was to have destroyed washy s army in brooklyn would have been gratuitous excessive such loss of blood would have defeated the purpose in mind in restrospect it is easy to find fault with this strategy and it would prove to be the only chance the british really had to crush the revolution in its infancy the battle of brooklyn needs to be looked at from several perspectives gallagher gives us a good start but i think a more comprehensive work still needs to address all the issues here
0,horrible the trampoline came in with out of the legs missing this is the second product form stamina that came in damaged i would not recomend to anyone
0,i will never deal with this company again my product arrived late and was obviously very old due to the corroded batteries in the airsoft gun it would not work after we cleaned it and i got no response from the company i had to throw away the gun along with my money i have enjoyed amazon in the past but would appreciate them reviewing who they allow us to do business with thank
1,i ve been a skating fan for many years and would recommend this book to everyone i thoroughly enjoyed the inside look at brian boitano s career from start to present it s easy to read so one can browse through it like a newspaper or magazine but it s also stuffed full of valuable information about the technical aspects of skating and the behind the scenes preparation activities for competitive skaters the beautiful pictures lend itself to being picked up and enjoyed again and again hats off to brian boitano suzanne harper and all the people who helped create this treasure for my coffee table
1,these shoes are the best i like the removable wheel you could heel to school and when you got there you could take your wheels out so nobody will know that you have them on you will be heeling across the floor in no time if you keep practicing on them it took me a while to get the hang of these shoes you should be absolutely satisfied when you try out these shoes they are the only shoes with removable wheels in the heels

0,this game was put together with a nice concept be a ctu agent and help jack bauer stop the terrorist attack also i liked the fact that there is a mole and that someone right next to you could destroy the whole game however the interactive games and such used to get more clues are not made well though you try to do what it tells you to do it doesn t seem to work since these interactive parts are so simple yet not made in a way that one can control what is going on you waste your time trying to do them and you never get to the end i had three college students and two adults try it adn no one could seem to get it to work correctly so if some bugs were worked out this game could be a much bigger success
1,photoshop is incredibly awesome and in reality most professionals already know that fact and have no need to read further about the program it is a must have for them however the learning curve here is extremely steep this program is designed for people that use it in their jobs daily to produce images for sale there are less inexpensive and easier to use programs out there for people looking to edit images for personal use including photoshop elements
1,these films used to be on tv all the time i was amazed at how clever the plots were i didn t remember some of them weird woman is my favorite b film and i m always recommending it to people movies used to be so entertaining it s great to have this collection available to film fans we can overlook chaney s stiffness as the rest of the cast really compensates for it
1,i am years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera i have had all types of cameras over the years mostly film canon slr s i too bought all sorts of these mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love slr s i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i can t keep my hands off of it it lacks nothing although the kit lense is good i bought a canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo s with it i love the way you can use the points to focus i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now don t have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a wonderful new feature like low light or non shake this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can t outgrow it its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be it won t hold you back the battery life is great the built in flash is good but i bought a and that s even better i never figure i m wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come i always missed my canon slr s and now feel that i have an old friend back again only much much better believe me you can t go wrong getting this camea its beyond description
0,i got this toy for my one of my triplet sons for his birthday and i am appalled that i paid for such a poorly made product they say it transforms into the batmobile that is a joke you have to take most of it apart to get it to fold back up so why bother with that feature in the first place the whole thing is made terribly it barely stands upright and the little plastic chains that suspend the one set of platforms keep coming off the little plastic hooks none of my boys play with it and now i am stuck with it because i don t have the box anymore to return it bottom line this was a complete waste of money
0,mississippi and sugar baby are great songs up there with the best dylan has done however the rest of the album while listenable isn t all that memorable still i suppose it s amazing that he can still produce a couple of great songs still after over years performing and recording the same cannot be said for peers like paul mccartney or the stones overall time out of mind was better although that too was a little overrated with only not dark yet standing in the doorway and trying to get to heaven truly belonging to the canon of great bob songs
1,this is a great pack n play it s easy to set up and take any place the bassinet is great very sturdy and larger than another one that i have the colors are bright and the music piece keeps our baby s attention my only problem is the piece for the top whenever i try to use it the arms bow in and it doesn t look very sturdy i also have trouble using this piece and the mat on the ground it just doesn t seem very sturdy and i have tried everything other than that i am glad that i bought this
0,the accessories that come along with this nice are great albeit somewhat impractical who s going to use a slingshot anyway but the thing that stands out most about this knife is the plastic handle survival knives with hollow handles can go either way as far as usefulness and quality but this handle has a cheap brittle feel to it that suggests easy breakage it s not too hard to conceive that the blade could break off from the handle under enough stress which makes this blade a dangerous one to use do not buy this knife or any other knife with a hollow plastic handle
1,they are exactly what i was hoping they would be i love the contoured front pouch all the web sites i saw and read about them said you may want to order size larger then normal i would agree with this unless you want a more snug fit my wife loves them as well and was quite pleased with the look and feel i ordered different pairs of unico s and they re all good quality and look and feel great
0,i have to clarify this is not the same as youthful essence it does not work the same and the product is not the same i must clarity that i dont want to confuse anyone here youthful essence for instance is not pasty or harsh or gritty it is very smooth and makes yours skin incredible and soft
1,all i can say is you must try this
1,this is perfect for someone who is prone to knock things around that are on their belt my husband uses this one and it has taken lots of knocks i would give it starts but its downside is that it dulls the vibration so he misses alot of calls
1,my year old daughter got this puzzle for christmas and she simply adores it this is her fourth melissa doug puzzle and i have to say she loves them all as soon as she is done with one she puts it away and runs for another one keep making wonderful puzzles melissa doug
1,i ve had several trimmers over the years and this one is by far the best strong motor easy adjust strong vacuum other reviewers commenting on the flimsy guard is kinda suprising to me one wouldn t want to push down hard against the face when trimming a beard the idea is to glide the unit over your beard you re not raking you re trimming also the unit is easy to clean out after use the waste receptacle snaps out easily as does the cutter head in order to shake out or brush out debris
1,my second pair knew exactly what i wanted small woman with small hands and small fit perfectly great deal
0,do not buy this cd he is definitely wack his silly rhyme style and dull voice sounds lethargic over uninspired beats as a member of children of the corn he was weak and he still is weak the other member of his dip set crew outshine him on his own cd how lame is that through away any cam ron cd s you own and immediately replace them with music by jay z
1,it was a relief for me to be able to keep and upgrade word and excel and to get virtual pc for access as well i used them a lot on my pc a few years ago and when i first switched to mac couldn t find software that did what they did i had no trouble installing the upgrade on my imac nor did i have trouble installing virtual pc the only thing that was disappointing was that i couldn t find out whether accessing the internet from virtual pc would open me up to pc type viruses or if mac s unix system would protect me there too i continue to be disappointed that the mac version of this software is not as rich as the pc version but the upgrade itself worked well for what it was meant to do
0,i though this shark would be bigger i bought the same one at a gift shop in ri for cents years ago
1,this game is very good it jsut sucks u in and u cant quit and before u know it it is don
1,in my case it was for my dad s birthday a couple days ago and it went great i placed my order a week before the event i know probably could have been too late but it arrived days later packaged really well in dry ice if you re looking for a gift for a male relative you will never go wrong with getting him some omaha steaks
1,i m a vegetarian and although my husband isn t he enjoys this soup just as much the tofu in the mix creates a creamy texture if you re expecting a potato au gratin flavor you will be disappointed however if you ve made homemade miso soup from scratch and like the taste this product makes an excellent time saving substitute the tofu serves a source of protein and the seaweed provides medicinal minerals this soup is excellent to drink when sick and remarkably soothes a sour stomach my local health food store charges per box of packets amazon sells it for a box substantial savings
1,i bought this watch and it is cute but the face is smaller than the picture makes it look luckily it was for my teenage daughter and not for me cute though
0,i ordered this item several months ago and its yet to arrive
0,the maternity support didn t stay in place it kept bunching up in one spot and didn t help my back at all i would not reccommend anyone to waste their money on this product
0,i purchased this camera based on previous good experience with an older model fujifilm camera reviews here price and functions at the same time i also purchased the larger xd card almost out of the box this camera has given me nothing but grief what others had said about the blurry photos i can certainly echo a month or so after purchase the lens would not open or it would not open totally i first thought the batteries were dead and that was the cause after changing the batteries the problems still existed some of the time not always just sporadically just enough to cause me to miss many unique and memorable photo opportunities in addition to that now that i m looking at other brands of cameras i find the xd card i purchased is not transferable so i m out the cost of that as well another malfunction of this camera is after erasing all photos on the xd card taking more photos and uploading the new photos i found that all the photos originally erased were still there and uploaded again with the new ones i don t know if that was a camera or memory card malfunction but it just added to my dislike of this camera i would not recommend this camera to anyone it s a total dud i m very disappointed with fujifilm and am now looking at nikon and cannons good luck fujifulm you need it
1,i bought this for my husband for christmas i researched a lot of frames for reviews picture quality size of picture ease of loading it with pictures and overall look this frame is excellent and my husband really cherishes it
0,i tried this product because i had been using arthred g powder which was discontinued this product did not mix well either when stirred or shaken and the taste is so offensive that i could not finish drinking it it tasted and smelled rather like soap if you used arthred g you know it was easily mixed and did not effect the taste of the beverage there is no comparison here i would totally avoid this product
1,i rented this movie about three years ago and fell in love with it i recently purchased it as a chritsmas gift for myself i loved it
0,i m not a good photographer but use my cameras for vacation backpacking pictures the was the fourth point and shoot nikon camera my family has owned one of the previous cameras had the lens quit woking probably because it got some dirt in it on the the lens extends out pretty far when the camera is turned on i accidently dropped it from about off the ground when it was only a few days old it landed on the back but flipped over on to the lens the outer ring of the lens ended up crooked and would not retract or focus i sent it back to nikon and as i expected they said the repair would not be covered by warranty they charged to fix it mastercard has a program called purchase assurance that will hopefully cover the repair cost the other night i saw a commercial on tv for an olympus camera that could be dropped from feet get wet or even frozen down to degrees f and still take pictures i wish i had seen that ad first the nikon takes great pictures but is way too fragile for a small point and shoot camera not buying nikon anymore
0,so i bought this item and i hated it i wash my hair everyday and it completly dryed out my hair it does smell good though but other than that ive used it about times and thats all it took to realize this is just not for me

0,i keep an indoor garden and i need accurate readings it is of poor quality and unreliable don t buy this
0,i was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings i have purchased leg avenue before and found them to be excellent however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone s truck brand as a matter of fact i ve bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings leg avenue is now off my list of course if they priced them three for a dollar now that might be worth the price
1,tom delonge is at it again with a new band and a new album even with being accompanied by the lead guitarist from boxcar racer angels and airwaves managed to have a completely different sound they dropped the more punk rock tone of boxcar racer in favor of an emo alternative style of rock the first released single the adventure is quite enjoyable and even though i haven t checked too deeply into it i think it s the theme song for nbc s studio besides how can you go wrong with an album that s gone double platinum in the uk and gold in canada
1,good job making a sturdy case that does not add too much bulk to a very thin device my major fear was that this would make my too thick and i would not use it it is just right and great protection for my by the way i replaced a with this and case because my daughter accidently sat on my and broke the screen it is a great piece of protection
1,this is a great lipstick and a wonderful idea from cargo i would very much recommend it the lindsay color is great and the formula is very smooth and sheer enough so that it goes well with your skin the four stars are because i love smelly things and this one just smells like lipstick it could smell yummier i suppose but so far i love it
1,i bought this camera in august it is really well made and the controls are easy to navigate i think it takes really good pictures inside and outside who cares about video quality its a camera not a camcorder lady i think it is a really nice camera its really durable too and it looks nice i would buy it again i researched a bunch of cameras before this one and i chose the sony in the end its one step up from just taking everyday pictures they look really pro i d buy it again
1,we finally have a stopwatch that fufills our every need the display was so large all i had to do was merely glance down i ve gone through several stopwatches but this one is the most durable
1,the desert gets really dusty so having this product to swipe over my car especially windows helps me save money on car washes i wish the package had included a bigger cover to store the brush in it s awkward putting it back into the same cover it came in once you start accumulating dirt
0,all thomas the train products are overpriced there are too many companies out there with a better selection of wood train sets for half the price choose one of those save yourself some money
1,this is a great camera the quality is good and the camera is very durable i ve accidently dropped the camera several times and it still works however i would suggest getting a memory card if you want to take more than pictures at a time
0,not what i expected when renting this movie as others have said clarissa came off too pure and innocent futhermore i don t understand why such a viriginal woman would run off to be with one of the most horrid men in the world everyone knows what lovelace has done there are numerous accounts yet she goes with him anyway blah the acting was ok the costumes were excellent i love period movies but the plot dragged and dragged and dragged and as another put it i was very glad when clarissa kicked the bucket i read a lot of historical fiction classic novels and love period movies but there was no liking this one it just couldnt be done
1,the megasoft bathrobe is pretty soft and thick relative to other bathrobes it has a nice feel to it the bathrobe is made of japanese yarn and the yarn is made of cotton so the bathrobe is made of cotton cotton of course strinks in the wash but the strinkage is tolerable i purchased the expresso color and after a few washes the color faded but that is to expected overall i am satisfied with this purchase and would purchase it over again if i had the choice to do so
0,i got this as a freebie along with w and it lasted only as long as i received it for one year the use of fur and skins was nauseating and i couldn t have been more disgusted at the vapid innocuous insights it offered this magazine has no redeeming social value
1,the earrings are lovely especially given the bargain price they came in a nice box too so if you want to give them as a gift they make a nice presentation overall couldn t beat this deal
0,i was very disappointed with the durability and time that it took to get this tent set up it took me about hours to assemble the tent and then once it was up it could never stay up the joining brackets couldn t hold the poles together and everytime the tent was moved or touched it fell apart i went inside the tent to put it back together and one of the poles fell straight down hitting me under the eye and cut it this is why i am returning it if it s not safe for me to be in then i certainly don t want my daughter playing in it
1,this product helps my colicky baby sleep through the night especially since she can t kick off the blankets i highly recommend it sizing is different than baby r us i m probably going to have to do some exchanges so thought i d provide info x small newborn to lbs small up to months to lbs medium months to lbs large months to lbs x large months to lb
0,i so do not understand all the rave reviews on this book i read it recently for a book club selection and let me tell you if i didn t have to read it i would have put it down after the first twenty pages and never picked it up again i found it to be dark depraved disgusting and depressing an examination of love in all it forms hardly these characters were just plain goofy i finally figured it out towards the end of the book these characters were so miserable because they were lost spiritually they were looking to other humans to provide them with true love and that is just barking up the wrong tree i am giving it one star only for the rich use of language
1,this is not my first purchase from iman cosmetics i love the coverage the powder gives and the color compliments me very well i would definitely purchase this powder again
0,i don t have a particularly large skull but these barely fit together on the bridge of my nose i don t see how the manufacturer can claim one size fits all as i said i don t have a huge melon like mike myers s brother in so i married an axe murderer the idea concept is great but i ll probably return them unfortunate because i was really looking forward to using them people with really big heads caveat emptor
0,this is the classic original round stick old spice deodorant formula and now i realize that it is really dated the formula hasn t changed since its inception and you will know it when the alcohol starts to burn your underarms if you want the great smell of old spice then just use the after shave and cologne but stay away from the old stick deodorant i ll continue to use the old spice high endurance deodorants which have improved modern formulas scents and work much much better
1,these earrings are very good quality sent to me quickly and in a jewelry bag a very nice gift
1,but buyers should be forwarned that the print from which this dvd is made was a poor one and alpha video the distributors of this classic capra movie made no attempt to clean it up here we have an example of a key artwork about america s psychological and political framework during emergence from the economic depression of the crying out for careful restration to the condition it so deserves
0,i enjoyed using this phone for some time it was functional it felt solid and it had a nice low profile look however after around a year and a half the continued act of opening and closing the phone has caused the hinge to crack and to gradually break off completely i now have to hold the phone together with my hand while i talk which is extremely awkward this is especially frustrating given the rest of the phone is so well made furthermore it seems to have unfortunately failed just before my upgrade opportunity in a couple of months and right after my purchase of some extra accessories batteries chargers search around online for hinge and you will find a lot of other people with problems like mine this in itself wouldn t be a problem if samsung would willingly replace the phone however they are not claiming it as a design defect and neither samsung nor verizon are offering to replace it bad form for both although perhaps verizon isn t as much to blame i would avoid both samsung and this phone because of this incident this phone is seemingly designed to be durable but it frankly is not meant for the long haul and is too pricey given its average performance
1,after using this software for a week i m generally pleased with the results the learning curve is not too difficult to climb though i have some prior experience with less sophisticated versions of this type of software the box comes with a thick printed manual which is nice to have for reference the index in the manual is good but not great unfortunately the manual is not comprehensive it appears to cover the core functionality but does not have any depth to its discussion of power tools the manual appears to be a nearly verbatim copy of the online help the software comes with short online instructional videos basically animated screen captures with voice over commentary the two or three videos that i ve watched have filled in the gaps that the manual left open my pc has a era celeron and of memory it renders the drawings fast enough to not be frustrating and i have limited patience for this sort of thing however i have not added great amounts of detail to the plan yet mostly just walls roof electrical and some trim the addition of detail may slow rendering down enough to be annoying other reviewers have complained about performance but the documentation has hints for speeding up if you run into problems while the core parts of the software are pretty good the power tools leave a little something to be desired this may just be a lack of education on my part but if so then i m going to blame the skimpy documentation these power tools almost appear to have been developed by either different groups or by third parties overall they lack the polish and usability that is part of the core software take the room wizard for example this is a slick way to put together the interior floor plan of the house the problem is that the room wizard launches almost as a separate application and when you re done it asks to update the current design when you say yes it appears to paste the picture drawn in the room wizard back into the main application from there it is difficult impossible to get the interior layout to overlay your foundation design i had difficulty with other power tools the topo designer is clunky the site planner has an annoying lot size limitation no line can be more than the estimator won t let you add additional materials you can put in the cost of concrete for your foundation but you can t add fill or stone for drainage if i have to manually put this stuff into a separate spreadsheet then having a built in estimator is pointless and so on again maybe this is a learning thing but the rest of the software is easy to figure out why are these so different overall i would give the software stars four stars for doing the stuff it absolutely must do very well minus one star for advertising extras that don t work so good plus a star for good documentation on the core functionality minus half a star for failing to document the extras i figure that the extra thirty to fifty bucks of cost over competing brands is due to these extras but i haven t tried the competition
1,this product arrived in a timely fashion and fit the grill perfectly
1,these shoes make my feet look so tiny but they are so cute i wore them with jeans and will wear them with a pencil skirt next week turns out jessica makes pretty good shoes cute
1,for anyone who loves trumpet music as i do this album is a must wynton marsalis has mastered twenty all time favorite pieces with such brilliance that no other trumpeteer comes near by comparison opening with j clarke s the king s march wynton proceeds to favor listeners with such baroque favorites as purcell s entrada from the indian queen j clark s the prince of denmark s march and j stanley s trumpet voluntary fantastic selections from bach mozart and haydn follow with the album also including such delightful listening as the last rose of summer carnival of venisee and flight of the bumblebee you won t be disappointed with this purchase
1,patriotic terrorist fighting storyline exposes the political games played in washington that many times put our military in dangerous situations this book inspires me to patriotism and also deep gratitude to the special forces men who are so brave i know the book is fiction but i can t help but feel that it is more truth than fiction mitch rapp s wife anna is getting a little hard to stomach she is a good example of how an aggressive woman can nearly neuter a strong man again hard to recommend to absolutely everyone because of the explicit sexual situations i hate to encourage my teenage boys to read it although is absolutely wonderful and inspiring portraying men as real men
1,i really like these as they are a lot less sweet than other brands
1,like the mtm show newhart has a style of humor that s timeless and this show seemed to get better with each passing season
1,her voice takes my breath away i fell in love with her i highly reccomend it
0,between the amended politically correct ending to this famous tale and the so very hokey interaction between kirstey alley and lloyd bridges i couldn t wait for this to be over the animation was very poor quality the music was not the focus my grandchildren lost interest shat else could possibly have been wrong
0,reading through john irving s the cider house rules i found myself continuing to read mostly out of a desire to have the book over and done with and only partly out of a sense of curiosity in obtaining a bachelor s degree in english i had to read a lot of books among them were many books that i did not like but never before had i read a book that was so completely devoid of subtlety every single scene in the book feels as though it was specifically designed and manufactured by the author to move the plot along people become pregnant have abortions and die with such terrible regularity that you can foresee it dozens of pages before it happens this goes way beyond mere foreshadowing the book doesn t flow naturally you can virtually see the author hiding in the shadows playing the puppet master there are just so many coincidences so many old friends just happening to run into eachother so many people becoming pregnant just at the exact time to make the story progress perfectly all of the characters vaguely distantly connected to eachother i don t want to spoil the plot but suffice it to say that the plotline involving the eames rhymes with screams family is just too much coincidence to bear it s as though the author is god and the characters completely lack free will and then there s the protagonist homer wells i put protagonist in quotations because despite being the center of the story homer wells barely does anything in the story he barely even speaks during the story he is virtually a non character devoid of personality or will around whom the other characters and events of the book revolve the scenes that do not involve homer wells at all and they make up the majority of the book are without fail the most interesting scenes i think that the real protagonist of the book is dr larch but even melony seems more real than homer does the story is very long and rambling subplots are begun and then abandoned and only mentioned in passing much later on minor characters keep popping into the story then disappearing only to pop back into the story exactly when they re needed conflicts are either quickly and conveniently resolved or simply ignored and forgotten like the situation with debra pettigrew after such a rambling at times rather boring plot the ending feels rather rushed it is as though the author realized that he suddenly had to resolve everything tie up every loose end in the last pages and tying up loose ends in this case means a lot of people conveniently dying to spoil the plot just a little homer wells who has throughout the book been opposed to abortion because he feels that a fetus has a soul suddenly and inexplicably and completely reverses on this opinion i personally am pro choice as well but i found that homer s sudden reversal was completely contrary to his character and caused the ending of the book to collapse into a bunch of nonsensical happily ever afters
0,as with some of the other reviewers mine stopped working and blew the fuse in my car for the cigarette lighter i bought a vector brand inverter at wal mart and it is much better
0,not a great deal of new insight here i did learn a bit more than i knew however about meade s failure to pursue at gettysburg mr boritt is the editor and author of one essay other essays are by four historians stephen w sears mark e neely jr michael fellman and john y simon alan j jacob
0,the video editing capability is tough to deal with and not impressive when you figure it out the tools are not explained and there isn t as much to do with it as they imply may be nice for birthday party editing i don t know i didn t like it it s not worth the other capabilities might be nice but from what i ve dealt with that s not the case
1,i ve used ez up tents for years at trade shows and other venues since i saw a review here that said it was used as a shelter for months and then it failed i thought i d point out that these are not permanent shelters i had one fail due to rain damage once left it outside after our wedding it covered the caterer table and we had a torrential downpour the canopy filled with rain the weight broke the support it was a tremendous amount of water the equivalent of a person sitting on a single crossbar the reason ez up likely told the person they don t cover wind and rain damage is because in eight months the thing had to have been rained on and blown at if you re looking for a fast to assemble cover for trade shows street fairs etc ez up s great
0,no way to change the inputs on your tv the dvd functions and the tv functions are accessed alternatly by pressing a tv button but there is no way to tell which the romote is aligned to therefore when you press the power button you have no idea which you will be powering on off the tv or the xbox and if things couldn t get any dumber if you press the eject button while the remote is in tv mode it doesn t work the eject button is only designed to work with the xbox yet it is disabled when in tv mode there is also no option to program a receiver as many others mentioned this remote looks nice but the people who designed it must have been drunk do not buy this remote unless you like wasting your money on garbage
1,tazo s chai black tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part on the paper tea packet tazo writes a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the himalayas on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of chai as cinnamon creamy sweet spice and medium bodied yet full flavored with the spicy kick of cinnamon ginger cardamom and black pepper tazo describes the aroma as sweet spice those are pretty accurate the black tea blend is a little bitter though even with minimal brewing it s a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter the ingredients in chai are black teas ginger cinnamon black pepper cardamom cloves and star anise it is caffeinated tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea tazo is owned by starbucks their web site is fun and quirky with a zen type focus definitely worth checking out it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings but not as good as numi i m soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo chai gets only four stars
1,this is the best micro peel i have ever tried the thing i noticed first was that when i applied when hope is not enough and the present they went on so smoothly they absorbed equally in my mid s my young skin is fading but this really brought it back i won t say i am again but i am sure the difference is obvious i am a hairstylist and my customers have been making mention of how great my skin looks since i added this to my bag of tricks it is a lot more effective that i would have thought and i have not had a microdermabrasion since i started using this times per month
0,first of all i was very disappointed when i received my waterpik cf cascadia showerhead it is all plastic i do not recall seeing that anywhere in the product specs i thought when i oredered a chrome finish that it was some form of metal sedondly even with the head made of plastic the plasic flexible hose is not strong enough to support it we could not use it because the hose would just hang there and spray the wall we installed it repeatedly following each step of the instructions every time thinking we were missing something i eventually returned the showerhead to amazon
1,i love lindt lindor chocolate truffles i fell in love with the milk chocolate and since i am such a big white chocolate fan as well i had to try this one its divine i will give it that but it tasted more like vanilla frosting than white chocolate it felt like i was eating some sort of vanilla cake frosting out of a can than white chocolate so i was dissapointed that aspect but it really is a great item despite that
1,unlike many of the other reviewers i actually bought this shaver to use on my head i have been shaving my head for the past years and during that time have used a panasonic it was a fine product able to be used either wet or dry unlike the braun but i had no idea that upgrading to the braun would make such a difference i shaved my head in one third the time it took me using the panasonic no longer did i need to keep going over the same spot again and again the braun took off the hair in one or two passes cutting just as close with considerable ease and less irritation i can t believe i wasted two years shaving with my old shaver i know panasonic has since come out with new and improved shavers and i can t comment on its new vortex shaver but i know i won t be returning my new braun any time soon
1,although not perfect i ve used roxio cd dvd platinum and nero and returned to using this product this should also be called burning cd s for dummies it is that easy to use i ve also used it to burn vcd s without a hitch if all you want is a fast disk copier and compiler this is for you
0,i love that little white cross on red and normally expect a quality product when i buy them i had this bag for about months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared in two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched one hole along one of the side panels and the other under the handle it would appear to me that the inside portion of the nylon wasn t properly sealed melted together to prevent the material from becoming unwoven the handle came about half way separated from it before i stopped using it this is a really disappointing thing for me because in the age of globalization quality always loses to low price and there seems to be fewer and fewer opportunities to buy really quality products without fear that it is crap with a high pricetag i would advise victorinox to pay attention to quality assurance before people abandon their products as overpriced junk products by a company who has sold out quality for price some of us are ready and willing to pay a higher price for a quality product
1,excellent software for kids it keeps my year old challenged and comes with different difficulty levels to choose from
0,i bought the happy co electric head tripper for my husband for christmas he has wanted ones that we ve seen in the mall so this seem to be a good one well the plastic pieces that fit into the slot were very flemsy we had to be careful not to snap it trying to get it in once we got it in the head tripper felt great it really did send goosebumps down my spine the only problem is the purple plastic piece broke off litterally the next day after giving it to him it first was bent and then finally broke all the way off i do not recommend this product i was thinking of getting the ting ting motorized head massager to replace them you can still use the happy head tripper it is just one tong short
1,this is a great and comfortable bra and it works for me it s a minimizer and is great for larger sizes i exercise a lot and it provides great support even good enough for running on the treadmill i have a few of these same bras that have lasted several years i am so impressed with them that i looked up the tag numbers on the bras and found this site to purchase more and it is half of what i paid in the mall now it is all i wear for everyday
0,i ordered this product june and am now told i should receive it by oct i wouldn t waste my time ordering this product from amazon
0,it only became clear to me how ms undermines mac by using its software as weapon when i began using ms office for mac i have used window s based excel everyday at work for the last years and i cannot figure out how to use the mac version efficiently it seems like an ersatz version from years ago if you want to work on powerpoint docs at home created on your pc at work you will find the effort not worth it the docs will never transfer formatting properly i bought this program and almost never use it because it is just so clumsy compared to the pc version having said that there is no alternative to ms office this is the outcome of ms having monopoly power no support and an inferior product for mac user
0,i must say i was dissapointed with those stories first story is so far from reality i know i know sometimes we want to get away but not that far i couldn t read even half of the story it was written very poorly sometimes i felt like something just wasn t enough at times opposite like it was way too much anyway i wouldn t recomend bying this book
1,following the demise of soundgarden in everyone was curious what chris cornell would do next would he immerse himself in another band where he could display his blood curdling screams or would he surprise everyone with something totally different he chose the latter with natasha shneider on keys and alain johannes on guitars cornell found the opportunity to break away from his heavily zeppelin and sabbath rooted musical background and he also asked some other musicians to make an appearance on the record the result is a very diverse album highlighting cornell s immediately identifiable vocals and relatively more simpler songwriting that said he had the chance to incorporate a multitude of other instruments including tambourine theremin and timpani besides the trademark blues rock ridden songs that helped cornell make a name for himself he also digs deep into psychedelia best heard on preaching the end of the world a song that finds cornell opting for thick radiohead like arrangements lofty acoustics and a strange mix of keyboard and guitar effects not too different is disappearing one guesting soundgarden drummer matt cameron with its moving vocal melodies shimmering keyboards and even a vague clarinet addition surely soundgarden fans expecting a very heavy record with meaty guitars and lots of aggressive vocals will be sorely disappointed but they need to realize euphoria morning was meant to be different way before cornell started working on it solo projects serve the purpose of letting the artists express themselves in ways they are unable to in their own bands and considering this euphoria morning is a huge success that said there are still some songs where the band behind cornell churns out some rocking riffs and rhythms such as flutter girl and especially pillow of your bones during the chorus the former starts out in an almost poppy fashion but quickly picks up a playful funk bass line and is finished off with a cool blues lead whereas the latter is more straightforward employing lots of acoustic and electric guitars as well as weird percussion work the final song steel rain is also a number that alternates between decidedly heavier parts and more haunting ominous moments the ethnic drumming great tabla rhythms on this track is quite experimental given cornell s music with soundgarden and later on with audioslave follow my way and when i m down are the most moving songs with the latter featuring a deft piano and organ melody beneath cornell s heartfelt delivery this is another song that embraces his love for bluesy guitar work and it also features some female backing harmonies during its pre chorus similarly the title track is a passionate piece where cornell sings entirely a capella over acoustic guitars there are no other instruments cornell plays his guitar and simply sings his heart out a remix of the effect laden mission would later be included on the mission impossible soundtrack while moonchild became a minor hit with its eerie atmosphere along with the opening song can t change me perhaps the most modern sounding upbeat song on the album despite being only three minutes though its flow is majestic borrowing harmonica tambourine and shimmering keyboards that climax at the final second my european copy of the album contains a very different version of the opening song with french lyrics accordion mandolin and female vocals backing cornell the song returns to its english chorus at one point but the rest is all delivered in french and perhaps more engaging than the original version in some ways chris cornell is one of the greatest voices in rock and this solo album is testimony to his greatness when freed from any band restrictions the man is capable of crafting some of the most moving and brutally honest songs ever
0,this will require a large mitten in colder weather this does not appear to use electrical impulse this will require more adapting to than you might think when working it is accurate
0,this movie started off about as refreshing as you could get sure there were lifetime channel moments and such but for a horror movie at least it didnt just dump a bunch of hapless teenagers in the woods for them to be hacked one by one the atmosphere was eerie and convincing the cave shots were well done the tension was building ever so slowly and it was somewhat un nerving when you just knew that something bad was brewing so the first part of the movie was thumbs up all the way unfortunately like sooooooo many other horror films it resorts to silly blood spatters and totally unbelievable situations and it gets old rather quickly the creative tension that got me hooked was quickly replaced by absurdity too much ketchup too many frantic scenes of the monster guys jumping around and of course the completely silly tough chick that kung fu ed her way through most of the monsters like they were invalids that alone killed it the main characters were disposing the bad guys too easily and some of the ways they killed them was laughable i was angry at this movie not so much because i wasted my time but because it had a lot of potential and seemed to run out of ideas so they went the gorefest route and completely chickened out of making what could have been a classic if it was done right remember how perfectly the original alien movie slowly but surely built wicked tension and it never released you from that tension remember how uncomfortable that movie made you feel for almost the whole running time this film started that way it was very creepy and made me feel uneasy just like alien however alien never let up and did not turn into a pointless gore fest like this movie did too bad it really is not recommended but rent it dont buy it if you have to see i
1,the service was prompt and the product was in great condition thanks r caspers out of stars
1,i don t know how to extoll the praises of this game loudly enough we plugged it in on christmas morning and the entire family and friends have been playing it ever since the selection of songs is excellent the sing and dance feature brings sends this game way out in front of earlier editions which we also have the eye toy is a good addition just everything about it is first rate i can t think of a single drawback my only suggestion is that you purchase the game and make it an experience for the entire family parents too
1,wow this is awesome you guys have everything i ordered for valentines day they serve as the lining of the valentines day baskets that i am donating to my local church after they dig into the delicious assortment of candies and fruit they can rejoice that they will find a fine fresh rabbit for stewing later that evening now if i only had some taters

0,i bought pair and the light did not work on one pair at all and the light only worked on the other pair initially then stopped working as soon as the mask got wet and never worked again very disappointing because they sounded like a lot of fun
1,this is just what i ve been needing for a power lifting diet or optimal health in general the flavor of the meat is not masked by salt yet the aroma is not as overpouring as other brands great stuff four stars only because it is per can
1,bought these batteries charger just before going on an overseas trip i didn t want to be bothered with frequently changing aa batteries which seemed to last only a day or so of heavy use i was quite pleased with the performance of these rechargeables they lasted several days of heavy use before needing to be charged and they re charged in only a few hours a big bonus that i didn t expect the recharger is compatible with european voltage so i didn t have to use an electric converter
1,av materials for catalan are very difficult to find but catalan is certainly worth investigating and this makes for a highly pleasant intro now if only eurotalk would come up with a second cd
1,warner herzog s grizzly man won the director s guild award for best feature documentary but the people who pass out oscars apparently didn t agree grizzly man was not among this year s nominees for best documentary many of herzog s narrative films such as fitzcaraldo deal with man s attempt to challenge the indifference of nature so grizzly man is not a departure by any means herzog s heroes are often obsessed with accomplishing some mysterious even bizarre goal timothy treadwell s fixation is on grizzly bears i am one of them he is heard to say he survived in the wild accompanied by a video camera and on at least one occasion by a girlfriend living among the most dangerous beasts in the world whom he apparently believed he was protecting animals rule he said fist defiantly pumping in the air timothy conquered treadwell became a minor celebrity during his life appearing once on david letterman s cbs show but he aspired to more before letting his love of animals consume him he tried his luck in hollywood he got an agent and auditioned for tv and movie roles he was he told his parents second choice for the bartender role on cheers which went to woody harrelson missing out on that opportunity left him crushed what really drove treadwell he reminds me of fey little carson on queer eye for the straight guy and as he openly mentions that it s easier to be gay than straight i wonder if he was homosexual but unable to deal with his orientation transferred his love of men to the roughest trade imaginable grizzly bears i like girls he volunteers but then he mentions various cruising places truck stops men s rooms in such a way as to make me think he had personal experience haunting these kinds of homosexual hangouts he was also an alcoholic were his wilderness adventures an escape from passions he was emotionally and psychologically unprepared to pursue those who are seen offering their remembrances of treadwell never allude to his sexuality they describe a man whose life is ruled by a naive hippy new age approach to nature and who died as a result the bears to whom he gave names like mr chocolate and tabitha need protection he said and he was their self appointed caretaker others suggest that despite his good intentions he did more harm to the animals than he could have imagined after treadwell was eaten by a bear the animal was shot and its remains became a feast for other forms of wildlife shooting a bear because he eats a man is comparable to shooting the customers at kfc for eating chicken what is a bear supposed to do with a human who invades his turf treadwell was an intruder one mans saystreadwell made the mistake of thinking these were people in bear suits but treadwll knew these were animals trouble is his knowledge of animals seemed to have been learned from disney cartoons the universe director herzog says is ruled by hostility chaos and murder treadwell had a different philosophy isn t that sad he squeals in his high pitched girlish voice as he observes a bee who apparently expired while doing his pollen thing i love that bee he says partially financed by the discovery channel grizzly man is superficially a nature documentary about a man who loved wildlife so much that he felt at home among the bears and wolves more than he did his fellow humans but it s also a portrait of a highly disturbed man who admits he was treated for manic depression but rejected medication to control the condition because he admitted he needed those soaring highs and crushing lows he also needed to record his solitary life on video we see him crying as he pets a wolf laughing when his command that god make it rain seems to have been obeyed and arrogantly blasting the humans whom he perceives as the enemy of the animals what we do not see is his final encounter with the bear that ate him mercifully the lens cap was on the camera when he was attacked the camera was running though and treadwell s screams and the screams of his girlfriend were recorded out of respect for his family herzog does not let the audience hear these recordings instead we see him listening to the audio and his reaction telling one of treadwell s friends that she must never listen to it just as she must never see the coroner s photos of the aftermath of the attack is possibly more effective than including the obviously horrific sounds in the film i had no life treadwell said of his days before he began to frolic with ferocious beasts now i have a life that life is memorialized in herzog s film brian w fairbank
1,i liked ssx series sequel being the best but i didn t play racers i bought first nfsu and disliked choppy animation i got part two just out of curiosity and i liked it so much i beat the game basically you are newbie in bayview city and you race different type of races and build rep and your car you must tune your car for each type of race and you must check shops frequently there are various shops from visual effect and paint shops to ones which improve your car speed handling etc races are also different you have races on isolated tracks races in live trafic street x races in confined and cramped space without nitro option with lot dirty driving and hitting short tracks in which you win if you shift the gear in time and my favorites drift races in which you win if you get most points not if you pass the line first drift races are won by breaking and steering in order to make long trail i used automatic shifting and i set game difficulty to easy since i don t play racers i was about percent and i got into race which was unmarked on map it was circuit race against boss and that was final one some advice for beginngers if you can t find races on map go to garage and check out world map option and you ll get list of all races per level if you beat them and can t find any more races upgrade your car or get some stars on visual rating by getting cosmetics new parts like spoilers lights new paint and you ll get an offer for magazine cover or dvd if you are still stuck cruise the town to find unmarked races
0,this product is horrifying it worked for three months at which point it experienced a complete meltdown started getting auto protect errors and suddenly could access the internet with explorer but not firefox it kept trying to send me to live update which wouldn t work so i uninstalled and reinstalled norton now the error happened again and i could access the internet with firefox but not explorer an error message referred me to an online fix but guess what you can t access any of their fixes with firefox you must be using explorer which is in and of itself offensive and obnoxious explorer of course wasn t working incidentally with norton uninstalled all worked fine so that was indeed the source of the problem uninstalled and reinstalled norton again hoping to get on explorer and get the fix before the error recurred but now i couldn t get on the internet at all at that point i uninstalled norton for good ditto on the fact that they don t support the product apparently don t stand behind the product and apparently aren t very concerned about their reputation very disappointing previous versions were just fine this is a complete mess
1,i was about to buy an escape hammer when i spotted this keychain rescue tool i like that it is small enough to store close to the driver s seat fortunately i have not had the need to use it

1,when you talk about the one motion picture that fully encapsulated all the angst and nihilism of the s generation you re talking about paddy chayefsky s brilliantly written black comedy the hospital which was released in a contemporary dysfunctional urban hospital serves as the microcosm of america s failure to deal with not only the physical maladies of the twentieth century but the mental and emotional illnesses as well george c scott stars in the role of dr herbert bock hospital administrator dr bock is already tittering on the edge of insanity his wife has left him he s estranged from his children and he s in the grips of a mid life crisis causing him to call everything he once held dear into question when a bizarre series of unexplained deaths begin to occur within the ranks of the hospital staff dr bock is left to ponder the nature of sanity and whether he can continue to function in a world gone mad with great performances by george c scott and the lovely brit diana rigg the hospital is a thought provoking film that will elicit discussion and debate watch it with a friend
1,nice little video for my zen during my long wait at the doctor s office confucius overcame many difficulties
1,this drum set is awsome and affordable it has a nice clean but deep sound and works for any type of music but since america now is scared of reading it seems people are neglecting to notice that while the picture has cymbols it has clearly printed it does not come with cymbals star though
0,i have to admit the main reason i purchased of these dvc s was because of the stellar reviews posted here on amazon i bought one for my in laws and on for my wife and i so that they could watch our children grow up over long distance great idea bad solution the main problem i had was that the camera lens is fixed and does not focus i waited hour on the line with d link tech support only to learn that the lenses on these cameras are designed to be fixed and only focus when you are approximately feet away from the camera unfortunately the ones i got did not focus at all and the video quality was absolutely terrible washed out color and bad contrast please listen to me save your money and do not buy the dvc this device is cheaply made and just not there yet
0,i bought the magazin on november and i don t recive it yet
0,this one is for you but honestly now the guy doesn t write beautiful voice but songwriting is a major appeal so guess a solo garfunkel is a lot like a step above justin timberlake ok there are definitely highlihgts like a heart in newyork what a wonderful world but generally this a very casual compilation good for a couple listens in general art garfunkel isn t really good for more than that check out him witht paul simon that is amazing stuff but this is kinda boring i might have a bit more respect if he wrote the songs but even though there are good songwriters writing for him the songs are still sub par
1,i have sensitive to sugar teeth and these are beautiful and healthy most granola bars you find in stores are full of sugar and have next to no nutritional value no thanks these are good for you and taste rather good too they are a bit bland but i like the texture with what s in them and how they re held together they re a bit like rice krispy treats but taste healthy yum i love taking these to work for a quick snack instead of vending machine
0,i have heard fabulous things about gripe water from fellow mothers but this particular brand is horrible the scent is strong and the taste is strong and medicinal there are other gripe water brands out there that do not have such scent taste upon ingesting only ml of this gripe water my week old daughter gagged repeatedly and vomited up until then she never vomited before if you want to try gripe water find another brand
1,the set is absolutely gorgeous in person and i m sure that it will only get better over time as the pearls gain in luster the clasp is also very beautiful with an intricate design and it s incredibly secure when fastened however it s difficult to maneuver and i can t imagine ever being able to put the necklace on or get it off without assistance that s the only reason i wouldn t give this five stars the quality and the value of this set are otherwise great
1,the shipment came fast and was packaged well in all a great thin
0,this foam product by jonathan is okay the reviews on his products are highly overrated the price doesn t bother me at all there are better foams for thin and limp hair
0,ok being the richest human being on the planet called earth bill gates decided that he s not wealthy enough so he released this microsoft office which i really think is not much different from previous edition the price is as usual very expensive what s worse is that bill gates decided all the pre installed windows in new laptops and desktops come with the trial version so mere mortals like us need to spend extra big money buying the full version to simply do some basic documents i can see bill gates being a deified bloodsucker using dollar bills as toilet paper and laughing at us who work their butt off just to make enough money to live so shame on you bill gates and microsoft
1,sacred pathways is easy to read plain balanced and straightforward the book surveys different spirituality types for each type it identifies scripture historical characters styles of worship and dangers the book contains an evaluation tool to help the reader identify his or her personal spiritual personality as with any survey tool this book does not go deeply enough into any particular spiritual practice it doesn t need to what it offers is an excellent service to the christian community for those who are trapped in a church that worships in a style predominately different from the their own this book offers the knowledge that the reader is not alone there are others out there that worship in the same way for those who believe that all true worship looks like their style of worship this book offers a broader view of the christian landscape i gave this book stars because it could have a potentially life changing impact on those who have lived in a closed environment
0,of little teenage white girls trying to sound like thirty year old black women first it was britney spears then it was christina aguilera now it s joss stone the former at least have something going for them britney s first album had catchy beats and even though aguilera s style is incredibly trashy she does have enormous vocal power and range if she would only stop trying so hard try as i might though i just don t understand the appeal of joss stone i didn t buy this album a friend of mine likes it and i ve had to listen to it enough times to want to rip my ears right out of my head i don t see what is fresh or original about ripping off janis joplin and the generally much more talented black soul singers maybe it s the rick astley effect you don t expect that voice coming out of that face you don t expect a squinty little teenaged blonde to growl and screech like a deranged cat but that effect can only take you so far as rick astley himself found out this album is not only an unpleasant listening experience because of the stupid songs dirty man basically just repeats you re a dirty man with very minor variations along with a great deal of unnecessary caterwauling and the nails down a chalkboard voice of stone herself it s a depressing reminder of how low our culture has sunk when it can t come up with any culture based on its own heritage but slavishly copycats things from another culture that seems more cool stone like aguilera and spears tries to sing like an older black woman a woman with soul an aretha franklin or a gloria gaynor but stone et al sound like little girls clattering around in grown up shoes they haven t been alive long enough to live similar experiences of the women they are trying to imitate their singing rings hollow to me show offy and fake stone could rival aguilera in shameless and unnecessary vocal theatrics though she has nowhere near aguilera s sweetness or range her voice might be described as smoky by some to me it sounds gravelly sandpapery and as pleasant as scraping your knees on asphalt i don t understand why anyone in the right mind would willingly put themselves through the ordeal of listening to this cd much less enjoy it i guess fake is good enough for some people it makes me chuckle though to hear people rave about her voice as authentic if you re looking for soul try macy gray she s for real try the hugely talented but woefully ignored tasmin archer and karen rodriguez those are fresh authentic voices that will make you realize what a load of bollocks joss stone and her ilk truly are the only white woman i have ever heard who could sing like she was black was linda ronstadt go back and listen to a ronstadt classic like hurts so bad and compare it to this modern day drivel ronstadt sang with real feeling real knowledge real pain worlds apart from this fake plastic imitation of soul that seems to be the rule and not the exception these days i gave this one star because there is no zero stars option joss stone is just a musical chav an unconvincing shoplifter of another better culture
1,the lived tragic story during the in a small town of the occupied czechoslovak a carpenter is hired arian controller in a modest and humble bottom store where her owner a jew old lady thinks the best about him unknowing what s really going on backstage i few words a major film told without melodramatic effects but told with asserted expression and crude realism another amazing evidence of the artistic foreseeing three years previous to the invasion
1,as someone who enjoyed previous castleavania games going back to the early nintendo systems i did find this new incarnation to be somewhat different than the games of old but i still liked it a lot basically this game has been my main preoccupation for the last weeks or so i d rank it as one of the top xbox games i ve ever played out of or so in terms of sheer fun level primarily i liked the fact that as you gain new items skills you can go back to previously explored areas and new areas will open up this expanding universe aspect makes it similar to the super metroid games and a little like some of the zelda titles for gamecube i also found the combine system of seeking out materials to create new weapons and armor to be very engrossing and i liked the various ways to obtain those materials steal from monsters seek out hidden rooms etc the graphics and sound fx are well below the all time great level of games like halo or but they re perfectly servicable ranging from very good to excellent i thought the spooky ambiance of the various castle hallways dungeons etc was actually captured rather well although i did completely get into the process of exploring the various worlds of this game especially with the help of some online faq references i will concede a few drawbacks the currency s uses are fairly limited there s only one shop and the things you most want or need cannot be bought there and in the later stages of the game you accumulate a lot of excess cash that can t be used for anything also the process of levelling up your character and his i d innocent devil companions definitely got rather repetitive and a little boring after awhile those are minor drawbacks however overall this is a great game
0,i normally bbq racks of ribs at once for our annual party thought that this weber rib rack would make it easier however i found that it was more of a hinderance than a help i like to baste my ribs with lots of sauce several times so i have to remove them from the rack for basting getting the ribs in and out of this rack was a pain if you re going to load in the ribs and just let them slow cook then it might be useful but that s not me so i gave my weber rib rack to my brother in law
0,blues singers shouldn t try to go mainstream if they do try and succeed fine that means they ve stayed true to their roots when they try and fail as susan has done with hope and desire one would hope they d try to get back to where they started for me that was just won t burn i guess when one is happily married with children it s hard to sing the blues since you re not feeling them you re faking them
0,she is not a singer she is not able to write play and read the scores music she is an entertainer the problem is you can t stop the stupid kids for buying the celebrate pop crappy albums today who still recognize this maid in the next years it is the same case like britney spears and spice girls ps pls throw away the cd from your window or burn it to the hot ash volcanos thank god for america s future pop artists like this one
0,this was a real let down for my daughter she loves horses and has several breyer horses when we saw this paddock she was so excited about it we decided to get it for her for christmas it is very flimsy does not stay together and breaks easily she spent more time trying to fix it than actually playing with it after a couple of weeks it was just completely not worth the effort and we put it up but later threw it away only the doll and horses were salvagable
1,my wife and i bought this item for the usual reasons we washed them and had no problems with fuzzballs or shredding they re just as soft and sturdy as they were before we washed them if not a little softer for the record we washed them on the cold cycle with other baby clothes they went through the drier for an hour at the lowest heat setting anyway i m just writing the review to offset the bad review there was nothing wrong with the pads that we received and they do what they re supposed to do get between the warm baby and the cold changing table

1,looks like this is what i need for short hikes a little on the heavy side but good for day hikes
0,this is a godawful movie a waste of several million bucks by universal and whoever else was responsible they could have paid my salary for my entire career for what it cost them to make this moronic notion to capitalize on what some executive must have decided was the sexy health club craze of the actors doing calisthenics in tights do not a feature film make lucas or spielberg or a mailroom clerk could have told them so
0,i subscribed to cooks magazine some years ago back when it began publishing again i had problems with issues that failed to arrive and wrote to them about it never received a reply or any note of concern since that time i occasionally glance through it at newsstands to see if there are any articles of interest even by dint of casual glance i ve begun to tire of the formulaic articles in which some drone tirelessly adds or deletes ingredients in order to finally come up with the perfect recipe for something or other i now skip right to the perfected recipe and decide whether its worth committing to memory some of the explanations for the success or lack thereof of the inclusion or exclusion of a particular ingredient are hare brained at best there are also two other areas of this magazine that have disappointed me product reviews they range from just plain wrong to idiotic the kitchenaid pro was hailed by cook s as the best in its class for many mixing chores yet the amazon reviews tell a different tale one of a short lifespan when used to mix bread dough because of a plastic gear cover that deforms and finally comes apart allowing the metal gears to separate christopher kimball the editor once performed an evaluation of cookware in which he calculated the price of the cookware per pound of its weight no i m not joking in that evaluation le creuset came out on top simply because it was heavy all clad even though it conducts heat very evenly suffered for not having as much heft and therefore was judged pricey on a pound weight basis one issue of cooks boasted on its cover unsweetened chocolate supermarket brand beats others apparently hershey s was designated best not too many months later callebaut was recommended above all others and hershey s was judged barely acceptable feeling manipulated yet finally there are those dreadful editorials by mr kimball rambling painfully written and punctuated with a picture of mr kimball wearing a bow tie and looking very much as if his head were being held on by it mr kimball is a humble man with much to be humble about he writes as if he were chanelling helen gurley brown but in red and black flannel watch plaid and without her sense of play time to re vamp this magazine folks

1,golfers share many things in common and one of these is an often fanatical love for the game for these types nothing can take the place of heading to the nearest golf course but golf digest comes very close this magazine contains over pages each month dedicated exclusively to the sport of golf the things that set golf digest apart from the competition are the numerous articles about learning and improving your game and the personal stories and interviews other golfing publications attempt to help you learn but they often get too mechanical golf digest shows you how to improve your game with tips from professionals including some of the star studded members of the golfing elite like tiger woods besides all the tips and tricks golf digest also shows the personal side of the sport with interviews and more intimate stories about the many colorful personalities in the game this personal dimension adds greatly to the magazine s overall appeal providing great reading material to complement the more instructional side of the magazine golfing digest may not be as great as a day spent on your favorite golf course but it comes close i consider it the best publication of its kind and i recommend it to anyone with an interest in the game
1,by far and beyond the best history periodical i have come across and consistantly one of the best magazines i have read i have subscribed for three years now and that says a lot for me especially given the price since most magazines don t keep my interest for longer than a year i find myself dropping anything i am currently reading magazines and books alike until i have finished each one easy to read and yet usually contains much detail that you can sink your teeth into the articles do a fantastic job of appealing to both the uninformed and the seasoned student of history ever have one of those teachers that would tell a story and then at the end after being rivited by the narrative you actually found you had learned something in a way that made you feel almost as if you had experienced it yourself well many times i find that this magazine does just that every now and then they do get a little fluffy but all in all unbeatable
1,first experience with this brand very well made elegant i actually had my first compliment ever what a good looking bar b q cover if it holds up well during our summer desert heat i ll definately choose this brand again along with the great amazon service

0,this is the flimsiest gate ever to boot it is not cheap i couldn t even use the screws that came with the gate i had to use nails and duck tape the instructions were wrong about sizing it up to fit your area and it took me over hour to put it together unfortunately when i bought this gate there were only reviews posted one was good and one was not so good so i was a little confused but i needed a swing gate so needless to say i wanted to make sure that i put my comments on so that no one else will get swindled this gate isn t even worth
1,if you burn lots of calories in your activities this high energy food could give you a lift there are calories packed into this little ounce bar which is advertised to be at least organic this bar is advertised to be for athletes first and as a casual snack second if you are overweight and trying to drop pounds you can skip this snack and move back to unbuttered popcorn when i opened this bar i noticed that it looks like compressed goop however the compressed goop tastes pretty good the texture is much like a granola bar though more moist than a granola bar the black cherry part of the black cherry almond is understated there are dried cherries in this mix rather than artificial cherry flavor which is a big plus i was unable to find anything in this bar that implied it was artificial which is an even bigger plus one thing that confused me a little is that the bar is advertised to have no wheat and no dairy but the label on the bar states that there may be trace amounts of dairy i guess they either knew there might be a very small amount of dairy or they were hedging themselves because of possible cross contamination from some other process in either case vegens consider whether trace amounts of dairy makes this an acceptable product the label also states that there may be traces of peanuts this bar also contains of the daily recommended dietary fiber which means drinking lots of water is a good idea when eating this bar there are also lots of vitamins and trace elements which may be a good thing unless you take vitamin supplements in which case you may need to consider whether you are getting too much of a good thing clif bars could be a casual snack but the ingredients and their marketing really suggest that they are geared toward individuals that are looking for a healthy energy boost in high energy activities if you fall into that category which could include hiking climbing bicycling running jogging and other similarly strenuous activities then this bar could be a good way of packing a big punch in a small package enjoy
1,very cute price efficiant only problem is if the band gets wet and you have sunscreen on your arm will get tinted blue
1,as an advanced exerciser i am always looking for a new innovative challenge the firm body sculpting ball workout provides just that this workout comes with a sculpting ball which is available in three weights four six or eight pounds i used the eight pound variety and by the time we got to the ab work i was ready to put the ball away my arms really got a workout as did my core there are several moves that require you to hold the ball out in front of you over your head and move it diagonally across your body i could really feel it in my core after the workout once we completed several segments of standing work including grapevine squats and lunges we go to the floor for bridge work and abs you have to hold the ball between your thighs during the bridge work which i found challenging since by that time i was sweating and the ball kept slipping away from me you also hold the ball between your thighs to do ab crunches which is difficult with such a heavy ball afterwards is a short cool down which i thought could have been longer tina leads and she is very fit and quite personable she cues well and gives a few form pointers along the way as with all the new firm releases the background is sterile and boring there are four background exercisers with allison showing beginner moves allie is holding the eight pound ball showing more advanced moves the music is nice and non intrusive beginners will enjoy this workout it isn t complicated and with a four pound ball you could get a really intense workout unless you re advanced and have some good upper body strength i would not recommend the eight pound ball you could injure yourself if you go to heavy in fact i was wishing i had another lighter ball for the floor work i have all eight new workouts and i ve done three so far of those i liked this one the best i felt i got a good workout but i wish it were longer the entire workout from start to finish is about minutes long another minutes would have been great although i suspect my arms would have been totally fried if we d kept going much longer overall i give this workout high marks it s definitely a keeper
1,really great quality for the price the hinges are well made so i don t worry about them falling apart when i wear them they are not white gold and diamonds they are what they claim to be silver and cz i like them
1,toad the wet sprocket have to be one of the most underated bands of the ninties they wrote some brilliant material and a lot of the songs on this album are very enjoyable but there are some strange ones that are do not appeal to my taste my fave song is is it for me it is hard to classify them though it sort of deep and meaningful at most times pop rock other good tracks include walk on the ocean pray your gods and i will not take etc i regard this album and dulcinea as their two best albums
1,if i had to pick one system to play exclusively based on several factors i d choose the ds now i m glad i have the option i e money to keep purchasing home consoles but if in some bizarro world where i could only take one system well you get the idea in a way the ds reminds me of the it s a bargain it s backwards compatible so it plays gba game the games are abundandt and perhaps more importantly they are varied and around you can t go wrong
1,it has been over hours since i showered and i still catch the scent as i move it is such a sweet sugary smell that reminds me of summertime and pop music this may sound like an odd description but it smells the way the inside of a jawbreaker tastes sweet and sugary it also has a hint of cherry or strawberry to it yum yum i got two bars and cut one up into small cubes to wrap in cloth and put in my dresser drawers to scent my clothes i love love love this stuff the reviewer who said this only lasts a week must use a ton of soap though who could blame her with a soap like this or take multiple baths showers a day because i have used it for a week and it doesn t look any smaller than when i first opened it it really helps to unwrap soap as soon as you get it so it can air harden before you use it this helps it last longer
1,very happy with it my husband and i use herbs from it frequently it produces so much we have had to trim and freeze some of the leaves for later use
0,saw these on sale at macys on the rack no box figured why not they felt good but when i tried them on at home the girlfriend started to laugh quite hard she said i looked like penguin butt and i have a waddle i m going back to other boxer briefs personally i didn t find them comfortable at all and i like this style a f dkny ck other jockey i ll stick to those

0,croton makes very superficial products they look good on the shelf but are very poorly constructed once you get them home they start to fall apart they have no customer service at all nobody answers the phone or returns email before buying a croton watch call their customer service you won t get through
0,admittedly the film is clever and the acting is good and it has it s moments of entertainment but overall it s long and pretty boring it seems it would have been better suited as a play which apparently it was originally i had just finished re reading romeo and juliet when i rented this thinking i was still in a shakespeare mood but this didn t do it for me i suppose if i had just finished reading or watching hamlet it would have been better my favorite parts are oldman s silent scientific discoveries completely amusing couldn t wait for the movie to end honestly

0,specs look good hdmi firmware upgrade over ethernet etc the unit seems to be solid heavy and well built however toshiba chose to ship this hd dvd player with only a composite a v cable yellow red white rca jacks in the box the best resolution you can get with this cable is and not even as good as an s video connection for that it is pretty amazing that a high end consumer electronics device which is advertised for its high definition capabilities and hdmi interface is being shipped without a cable set component video or hdmi that actually makes it possible for the customer to connect it to an hdtv i don t know how much cost savings toshiba gets out of not including a cable that costs less than now let s get to the real review pros one of the best features of this unit is its capability to upscale regular dvds to the upscaling is very high quality the unit also has various noise reduction options that help with some of the poorly mastered dvds if the weight of the unit is any indication build quality is high it has an ethernet port for firmware updates and possible future functionality cons very slow boot time takes longer to boot than my windows xp pc especially durimg hd dvd playback the unit gets very hot make sure your enclosure rack is open in the back there is a somewhat loud fan unit in the back of the player this player has no zoom scaling functions for dealing with non anomorphic dvds so you have to use your tvs scaling function kind of a pain since the image quality suffers when the video has to go through two parallel scalers
0,these shoes are hideous who would wear them they are so uncomfortable they always give me blisters i hate these shoes do not buy them unless you like getting blisters

1,i bought this pump after the avent isis failed me along with an electric pump the fact that this pump puts so much control over suction power in my hands is great im able to empty each breast in min or less sometimes although its a little loud it is a manual pump and all manual pumps are a little noisy from reading the other reviews i think that alot of other mothers expected results from this pump that just arent reasonable remember most manual pumps arent for constant expressing purposes or for bringing in milk supply if you read tegh package the manufacturer even says that they recommend the pump for emptying breasts occasionally like when spending time away from baby or breastfeeding moms who express once or twice a day so others can feed baby and they discourage it for working moms who have to pump everyday

0,we bought our machine weeks ago it looks wonderful nice sturdy with alot of different features but we haven t been able to use it it didn t work from the day we brought it home and have been fighting with ironman s customer service department ever since they keep giving us the runaround saying different technicians are coming but nobody ever shows up evertime we call their number we re on hold for at least minutes before we even get to talk to a person and then they just lie and say they will either call us back or have someone out that day well after weeks we ve had it we re taking it back and never buying another ironman product again they re nice machines with good warrentys but what good is it if they won t get anyone out there to fix it nothing against the store they ve been great just big thumbs down for the manufacturer

1,first off this game s graphics are not mind blowing they are very good but they are not as beautiful as the xbox or the playstation that said that is not the reason that you buy this game the game has amazing replayability because of it s amazing controls and fun factor you turn the wii remote on its side and use it as a steering wheel when on a massive jump use the steering wheel to change your pitch and land safely perfect landings are met with speed boosts playing this game with friends is a blast your friends will be wowed by the controls and then wowed by the fun they re having i have played several of the wii games already and this is my favorite must buy

1,i subscribe to all of the home and garden magazines and southern accents is the best bar none the houses featured are absolutely dreamy the photography is gorgeous and while the magazine doesn t offer how to decorating ideas there is so much inspiration i find it to be intelligently written which is rare in a decorating magazine the articles on antiques are particularly informative this magazine will appeal to anyone who is interested in beautiful classic design whether or not you live in the south
1,this is a direct comparision between the linksys and trendnet both perform as expected when used as a standalone hot spot detector both perform as expected on windows xp installation was quirky for both after driver installation inserting into usb slot it wasn t recognized at all fiddled around for awhile and it finally detected the device had to disable the notebook s builtin wireless before xp recognized the device client software does not detect a device under windows vista ultimate i assume this will be true for windows vista rtm too inserting the device into a windows vista system often completely froze windows vista had to hold down power button for complete reboot had to disable the notebook s builtin wireless before vista recognized the device appears that the trendnet and linksys devices are so similar that they must be made by the same oem or reference design as expected evaluation results are similar both devices seem to have same sensitivity similar to notebook s internal wireless card trendnet device doesn t have windows xp signed drivers so an extra click during install is requried also installing on new usb ports requires extra clicks trendnet device supports whereas linksys does not trendnet device sometimes crashes vista ultimate neither device s software client works under vista ultimate this isn t a deal breaker for me as they both work under vista ultimate networking as a usb wireless key you just lose the client software feature the linksys has a somewhat useful backlit lcd trendnet does not both devices work as standalone hotspot locators equal well in hotspot mode both devices show ssid channel number encryption mode etc conclusion for xp i recommend the trendnet so save the extra dollars for vista i recommend the linksys device as it never crashed vista ultimate whereas trendnet device was gave occasional freezes
0,i received to stereo headphone adapter one didn t work the other works but with a lot of loss of sound quality if you push the headphone jack male all the way in to the adapter sound is cutoff on one speaker you have to play with it and find the sweet spot where sound comes from both speakers and even then the quality is not good
1,i have been using mcafee products for the last years i did not have any problems with viruses but it is true i try to stay out of dubious web sites i purchase my mcafee software from amazon every year because of their rebates and every time i see star ratings it is unfair their products are excellent i have installed mcafee internet security suite on two computers so far the first one is a dell laptop i unistalled the previous edition and ad aware since ad aware and the ed are incompatible and the installation was perfect not the least problem i ran into problems though with my desktop i have tried to remove the edition and i could not find a remove button in windows add remove progrmas i poped the ed in and it said that it will remove the old products automatically after the instalation the firewall did not work i noticed that somehow the old ed was still there i went to mcafee s web site and i got a removal utility that got rid of all mcafee products on my computer another great tool i used off of their web site was virtual technician which told me that the entire installation was messed up however after cleaning up with the other utility i did a fresh installation and everything works perfectly it took me a few hours to get a hold of the problem yet i love to play with computers mcafee should not be hold accountable for a product that performs excellent in normal conditions i continue to trust mcafee s products i love the cleaning utility it is very thorough i plan to use it every day before visiting banking and financial sites it cleans all of your internet traces it takes a while until you get used to where all the tools and settings are placed yet any new complex bundle of software would present you with the same challange i hope that the edition will have the anonymizer built in it would be a great tool in the end protection is what it matters and mcafee virus scan and personal firewall have done it for me for the last years

1,it s a useful tool combined with another norton s products ghost you can easily perform pc maintanence using these tools
1,this is a thuroughly enjoyable movie a pleasure to watch the acting characters and story are entirely plausible and there is no grandstanding by primadonna actors nor is there any of hollywood s usual political preachiness especially unusual considering robert redford s backing the only downside to the dvd is that it is full screen and not letterboxed the bonus features are somewhat lack luster as well and the menu system is laughable only one actor s credits have been updated since the movie was released and the credits section is a token gesture at best still this is one of those cases where it is cheaper to buy the movie than rent it twice
1,i ve used this to produce batch after batch of great sprouts with no issues the only reason i m not giving it stars is that the instructions are confusing and contradictory

0,i bought the dual room imonitor yesterday only available in store at babies r us it is the same as the one shown here but it has two transmitters to montor two children based on only hours of testing i am taking the unit back pro the range was great whole house plus outside no interference i live in a dense suburban area with many sources of interference easy to setup shape size of parent units are much better than others especially sony cons controls are not very straightforward the unit always hisses it is not sound voice activated the power switch on the parent unit is a button that is not recessed when you turn it off it does not beep or let you know that you did the button is easy to bump and would make it easy to carry the thing while it is off and you think it is on the deal breaker a power outage requires turns off child units with even a short power interruption the child units come up in the off mode you have to go to the baby s room and turn them on until you do the parent unit will beep and flash red we have been using the sony for years with our first child i guess it has spoiled us
1,my engineering classes don t allow for the ti so i needed a calculator that allowed for matrix reduction basic vector manipulation and single variable integration for my engineering class the matrix reduction capabilities has been a major time saver especially on tests particularly for solving systems of linear equations especially in my statics dynamics and strength of materials class the line natural textbook display prevents me from getting lost in a calculation with multiple parenthetically nested expressions and is a must have the scrolling ability to grab values from previous calculations saves time and preserves accuracy very nice the only thing preventing a star rating is that i thought the exterior design make is awkward to use at times but that is because i m used to square calculators also i would have like this model offered in black
0,two weeks ago i saw these onions out behind the denny s on they were speaking perfect english not a hint of a spanish accent then just yesterday i was at a rendition of cat on a hot tin roof and i saw one of them pretending to be german it s all a sham these are simple american onions trying to be pretentious and pass themselves off as something exotic don t believe the hype

0,if you are looking for a feel good book about baby boomer retirement this book may have some value for you but if you are looking for specific in depth how to this book isn t the answer each segment work dreams travel is short and doesn t address many relevant issues for example regarding the work chapter the author postulates that there will be a work shortage and companies will hire baby boomers to fill the gap well that is speculative with globalism those jobs may be outsourced most are low paying many of my highly qualified friends are unable to find jobs despite retraining yes there may be wal mart jobs but is this your retirement dream the work chapter sounds a lot like most do what you love books but doing what you love is often best as a hobby not to furnish needed income these and other issues facing boomers who want meaningful work into their are not addressed i could pick apart other chapters in the same manner
0,i ve used the palm os going on years now when my treo died i bought a used on ebay eventually that one died too and i bought an unlocked on amazon i called palm tech support on issues i had with it dial up networking didn t work on internal browser with t mobile forgive me for saying it but the guy at palm support was as dumb as dumb can be i got someone overseas who told me one inaccurate thing after another he insisted that my treo never allowed dial up networking with the internal browser even though i told him first hand that i used it all the time did he think i was lying to him he knew nothing about the phone and kept deferring to a supervisor constantly keeping me on hold and it was just a huge waste of time after a few calls like this with no resolution i gave up and decided to return the i then tried the t mobile mda i was uneasy of the idea of switching to windows pocketpc but decided to give it a try for me it was a huge mistake pocket pc is a joke and completely unintuitive they expect you to study how to use their os in order to make use of its clumsy interface friends tell me they sell party applications that make it easier to use but c mon when you buy a phone you expect it to work right from the beginning i don t want to have to spend time learning and installing additional software for it to work properly finally i give up on pocket pc sold it on ebay and give palm another try when i see the come out the dialup networking issue is no longer a problem on the as compared to the and i buy it unlocked directly from palm overall it s a decent phone and i just feel way more comfortable with palm os over pocket pc palm customer support is still useless and as others have mentioned the lack of a standard mini usb connector is simply inexcusable still i m much happier with palm os over pocket pc as i use it i see that the battery doesn t seem to last very long just over hours of talktime at the most i hesitantly call palm support and get some flunkie again i decide to cut my losses and stop wasting my time with their support i m just going to buy a second battery and second charger to keep the phone charged i hate the idea of making such a compromise but for me it s the lesser of two evils the fact that palm would release a phone with such terrible battery life is indicative of their customer mindset they just don t care as clunky as my windows mda was its battery life was at least to times what the treo gives me even though the mda has a much bigger screen imho the smartphone market is still going through growing pains the original handspring treo was designed by good people when palm bought them out they cashed in on the treo product line but the customer oriented mentality of handspring went right out the window along with any intelligent design evolution of the treo most of the better designed smartphones on the market samsung motorola htc wizard are all made for pocket pc because microsoft has used it s clout to take over the market i just wish other manufacturers offered palm os based smartphones again this way you d get the intuitive interface of palm without having to be limited to palm s poorly designed hardware maybe it s time i finally give the blackberry a try
1,this game when released was the best person shooter console game available but today with doom and half life versions for xbox there is actually something to compare halo to and it doesn t stand up first off the plot is utterly pointless i never felt invested or sympathetic to master chief just frustrated when he died that i would have to replay a section the weapons are lame released after the pc version of quake iii halo s weapons seem limp in comparison none of the futuristic aspects seem particularly believeable or useful for that matter the vehicles suck driving the vehicles in halo is as fun as operating a forklift which is actually quite entertaining in gta san andreas so maybe it is not quite that fun i guess it is more like driving that super action wacky bike from the southpark chimpocoman episode player story mode rules the best part of the game and the only reason to reccomend it is it is a great game to play with a friend multiplayer deathmatch is average give halo props for the first decent multiplayer battle for xbox but it wasn t as good as it s pc competition when it came out the much older quake iii still looked and played better and now seems ok but no better than most that said the player campaign and multiplayer make this a good diversion just don t expect the immersive atmosphere of doom iii or the intriguing plot twists of half life

0,i only wish i had read the previous review before i bought this item i too was trying to convert my tapes to digital format using the pass through on my sony minidv handycam i bought this way too expensive cable mostly because it was the only option available it seems ridiculous to me that a cable should cost as much as a low end disk drive or graphics card considering the technology involved in those devices but my real problem is with the failure of sony to reveal that the s video connection is useless for input this information is nowhere on the package nor is it on their website there is a notice saying please make sure this cable is compatible with your camcorder before you purchase you can t read that warning when buying online and if buying at a store there s no way to know what s compatible because they don t include a list of compatible camcorders on the package i guess they assume everyone will run home and check their website then come back to the store and buy it instead of just buying it and seeing if it works there is a section of the handycam manual describing how one might record from another video device using a cable such as this one however they fail to mention that the sony cable won t work despite the premium price they charge if the problem is that they couldn t make it work with both a composite and s video cable then they should have just made it work for s video since a composite cable comes with the camera shame on you sony for adding a little aggravation to my day and shame on you for creating yet another proprietary communications standard that allows you to rake us over the coals when we need to buy accessories supporting that standard it s enough to make me want to buy a canon camcorder i buy canon digital cameras precisely because i don t want to submit to proprietary sony standards like memorystick rant over

0,save yourself time and buy any book by greg lemond greg lemond s complete book of bicycling or john howard john howard s the cyclist s companion they are both far better writers well rounded bicyclists and honorable family men good role models for all true cycling athletes young and old alike lance armstrong is good at chronicling his many bicycling events and achievements in this book but what is notably missing from this text is the experience of a genuine champion lance armstrong would sell his own grandmother s last pair of socks in order to succeed leaving his family behind in order to pursue his one dimensional goal of winning the tour de france he sold his wife and three helpless kids for bicycling success and he degrades the sport and his wonderful family by publicly flaunting his association with a pathetic and desperate rock singer yawn better to settle down with greg lemond s wonderful book for real depth excitement and rich experience and learn how to become a well rounded cyclist and a real champion cycling athlete and family champion as well

0,i live in colorado one of the states that receives emergency funding because the illegal alien situation has gotten so out of hand this movie is about a town called farmingville and the disruptions in their lives as they literally wake up to find mass groups of illegals outside of their neighborhoods some live to a house and have cars coming and going every day imagine how that would bring down the resale value on a home the aliens surround the streets to hustle for work right out in the open the video documents the two sides the ones who support and oppose the situation the side that opposes the intrusion into their lives painfully reveals their exasperation at their own city s inability to instill order and law as women who go to the neighborhood are whistled at they become nervous as a women offered in the video unfortunetly it was not shown the thick misogyny in the mexican aliens was especially disturbing example a women who was with a special interest gruop to offer services to the illegal men was unsure whether they would listen to her as in the mexican culture some create groups in support others create and claw for order eventually a town meeting is called in which one of the women who runs the opposing group is called a rascist by her own politicians as he is flanked by two illegal aliens who nod in agreement it is especially poignant to watch as this everday american women brings the situation to her counsil members they call her a rascist and many of the illegal aliens surround this politician in support it was disturbing to see a foreign lawbreaker have more influence over our politicians than one law abiding women and her attempts at trying to instill order in her own town i don t believe it portrayed the opposing townspeoples side very fairly they had every right to be exasperated our we not in a terror war since when does mexicos problems come before our own maybe because it was made by carlos sandaval it was more unobjective i felt the film more unfairly depicted the opposing against illegal immigrants as mean rather than literally mindblown and aggravated their laws weren t being enforced when does the nations people not have a voice in their own country
1,years ago the sporting news was the fans bible i can remember what a special feeling it gave to look at it the real lowdown the most bottom line stuff more statistics than even the greatest baseball nut could ever remember i no longer really follow the game or any of the games as i once did and most of the figures even the names of the players are strange to me now i picture in my mind my uncle the late broadway abe freedman who lived his life to see the yankees lose picking up this paper and cursing at some columnist proclaiming the yankees the favorites to take it all in the coming year that coming year and so many coming years are already gone but there will be a next year a next season another sporting news and someone somewhere in america devouring those numbers as if they were crackers jack and cold beer at the seventh inning stretch

0,infested josh olson it s really kind of impressive that a movie this bad doesn t get shelved somewhere along the line and yet here it is in all its painfully cheesy glory on my screen daring me to turn it off i almost gave in to the temptation but i kept watching for you dear reader so i can give you a full account of the true horror to be found here the ninety minutes of your life that you will never be able to get back if you rent this movie and sit down to watch it the story what there is of it a number of friends show up at the estate of one of their high school buddies who s killed himself there s all the post funeral bonding stuff and everything s looking remarkably big chill when things go horribly horribly wrong thanks to vicious genetically altered flies that possess humans and turn them into soulless murderers yes you got that right as usual the only reason to watch a movie like this is the cheesecake factor any jo johnson plays the dead guy s girlfriend well ex i guess and there is an obligatory scene where she shows a whole lot of skin it is not however an out and out nude scene sorry guys there is also the gorgeous lisa ann hadley general hospital port charles who s really starting to look like kate hodge this is a good thing a very good thing you re certainly not watching for the special effects amateur even by microbudget indie standards the acting atrocious the script even worse the direction competent at best the cinematography ditto the soundtrack cheesy early eighties pop that should have faded into obscurity years ago or really anything else so it s gotta be the cheesecake and that s all well and good but you can do that on fast forward i strongly suggest that route at least you ll waste less time on this half

1,for newcomers to the saga jumping on board at this point in time may not be worth it however if you ve already been sucked in by the first two you should find this to be quite enjoyable a few changes and simplifications to the battle system will make battle less of a chore the story line of course is stillthe main focus ofthe game so if you ve been dying to see what happens next to our beloved crew this game will give it to you i however do not recommend this game for those who enjoy gameplay over story line
1,the dispenser looks good holds a decent volume of shampoo conditioner etc it is simple to refill the bottles and so far there is no leakage the mounting was easy glued onto the tiles with silicone glue included if it broke or we decided to replace it we would probably struggle quite a bit to get it off the tiles the top shelf does not have a cross bar on the front so if you mount the dispenser under your shower head the hose will knock over whatever you might place on the shelf the little hooks will hold disposable razors but not the ones with larger heads overall satisfied good product for the price

0,i just took a course from the florida highway safety program i thought something like this would be wonderful especially for little ones in the rear facing position i was dead wrong anything put in front of on the side of in fact anything in the car is a real safety hazard in case of a crash this toy even latched down poses a threat to the baby he or she may just have to be bored for a while on long trips have mom or dad or sibling in the back seat with baby for entertainment

1,all i can say is wow just wow i wanted some good replacement windshield wiper blades for the bosch blades i had they were about a year and a half old and weren t holding out well i did my research and decided to look into silicon rubber blades after reading so much about them i was first going to get the piaa brand however the price and five year warranty the silblades offered changed my mind i haven t looked back since one of the things i hated about my old blades is they ended up making a lot of noise when sliding against the windshield unless there was a decent amount of water pouring down from the first day i installed these onto my car and that first rain drizzle came down i was sold the blades are whisper quiet even with just a little moisture on the glass you literally won t hear them heck they are quiet even if you have no water on the glass all you will hear is the motors that turn the blades my old bosche blades weren t anywhere near that quiet even right out of the box the silblades seem to work really well in getting the water off the windshield too i dare say better than any other blades i have used some other blades i had would sometimes leave a thin trail of water still on the glass but not the silblades everything wipes clean from the blade s path also it s true what they say about the silicone in the rubber leaving a protective coating the rain on your windshield will start to bead just like after waxing your car i can t say it happened immediately because well my windshield was waxed the day before i installed the blades however the beading has lasting much much longer than it should have from waxing alone i live in houston tx so i m love how these blades hold up against the searing heat no cracks yet or even color fading i can t tell you how well they do in snow and ice since we don t get much of either here and i haven t travelled anywhere to test the blades on that yet however i don t doubt the manufacturer s claims on standing up to the bitter cold the piaa silicone blades claimed they could do all of these things too however they were per blade and were only guaranteed to work a year the silblades have a five year warranty and the price can t be beat if you really really want a noticeable difference in our windshield wiping experience then i suggest you grab these for your own vehicle you will thank me for it
1,as a novice astronomer i really enjoy the sharp steady view with these binoculars the view is fairly steady even with the i s off depending how stable you are of course my binoculars cost more than my telescope and my telescope is a decent one too but i think they are worth it you see so much more in the night sky than what the naked eye can see by far they are of course great during the day too their weight is not much of an issue for me although each person is different depending on their viewing habits i think a hard carry case would have been the best but it s not a big deal for my use i recommend this pair of binoculars to anyone who is serious about great quality and performance
0,actually i would give the product stars and the packaging a minus citylips really does work plumping and hydrating it does required repeated applications but the packaging results in about of the expensive material being completely unavailable worse if you try to wiggle the too short applicator in order to get the last the container breaks at the neck actually one came already cracked in my case true they do offer some colors at price but most effective is to apply clear and go outside the lipline and the clear almost never has gone on sale

1,i ve been using norton antivirus with annual updates of patches forever with norton internet security now that it s time to renewal norton antivirus i thought i switch to trend micro internet secuirty after all the glowing wins it received from certain mainstream computer magazines i like norton but it was a memory resident hog in the taskmanager considering i was running a laptop with on winxp pro resources are valuable also newer norton antivirus version were a hit and miss after also reading reviews at amazon i took the plunge with trend micro my review of this product can be best summarize along with it s relations to norton antivirus updated pros of trend micro fastest virus scan i ve seen i have not find any virus in my system yet whereas norton would fail in about of the time i e one stalling virus every year check incoming and outgoing mail like norton scan selected files as i chose just like norton alert and block virus threats monitor nearby wifi connection mail in rebate making the price net at it s been months since i ve mailed it and not received it yet uses about of system background resources versus norton s cons against trend micro very annoying auto virus update every day that i log on the internet i only have a connection and updating takes minutes i m not trying to save the internet but everyday update may be a bit too much so i would prefer to have a preference setting that i can choose myself norton is not as annoying on a wifi network trend micro firewall failed of the gibson research shields up test ports were open norton internet firewall close all major holes except for the non critical ones which wasn t a big worry i ended up disabling trend micro firewall and using the norton firewall instead as it s a full software and much better analysis and deeper protection anti spam and data protection were subpar as i got advertisements and pop up from certain websites like west cost major newspaper using norton firewall stops them dead never seen them again still waiting for rebate overall i think using trendmicro internet security for it s fast virus check and a separate norton internet firewall is the ideal combo for me on it s own merit trend micro would be perfect only if ram and other resources are low as the case with my laptop but i wouldn t mind using norton if i had plentiful more ram
1,after trying every wiper from the wally world variety to even the most expensive bosch wipers i ve found performance and longevity was actually about the same throughout the spectrum of windscreen wipers i was very disappointed in how long they would last about months of perfect wiping before purchasing a set of the icon wipers for my volkswagen golf i was about to spend a few hundred on oem wipers aero from the which seem very similar to these after more than six months of use i am glad to say they still perform very well and there is yet no need to replace them i only wish bosch would make a version for the rear window

1,i bought some of these to wear with a drapey shirt cut open nearly to the waist and these little covers made me feel way more confident that even if my shirt slipped a little nobody would be able to see anything the nude ones were practically the same color as my skin so they were perfect they also stopped any embarrasing reactions to the cold the best part was they didn t feel weird at all
1,what i mean here is about and a half stars which in my little scheme of things means the good pretty clearly outweighs the bad and i recommend it with a bit of enthusiasm star games are very rare for me and this game made a good run at it i can t even imagine a star game i ve come to think there are too many inherent problems in games for stars anyway ahem this is about gun a very nice game i looked forward to a lot i played it just after it came out and hopefully havent forgotten too much about it the positives graphics this seems to be a bit controversial as some people complain about them but frankly i sometimes think people overrate realism and detail gun s detail was not like i dont know half life or something i didn t repeatedly go wow unbelievable todays technology but i really enjoyed them they were pretty to look at they set the scene well and they were extremely refreshing bright colorful open western vistas instead of dark gloomy tense industrial claustrophobic and filled with horror creatures and commandos like i don t know of all shooters it was lovely to ride my horse around spotting buffalo and hot springs and such i appreciated that quite a bit difficulty well i can t remember if this game had difficulty levels but i like difficulty levels and make a bee line for the easy choice i do not like dying even if i can reload right away and i am not too great at these games well so up until the last part of the game more about that later i had no real problems and generally felt clever and talented but not coddled and unchallenged the poker was too easy though and i could not get the hunting and gave up on it part way through i thoroughly completed everything else characters voice acting pretty good characters helped by superb voice acting i don t want any spoilers here so i ll just say the quality of the characters was let down by the storyline but i still liked them and they looked pretty good to me gameplay it was quite fun and varied it had some of the best bullet time ever called quickdraw or something i loved how you could flick target to target with a single button which not only made me feel more impressive but also raised the speed of mowing down enemies in a way that made it less ridiculous that i was beating people in a gunfight the horse riding was done very well and it was nice to pony express i liked that poker was in it though found it a bit limited and both the ranching and mining were really nice and helped fill out the world and the variety of things you do length i may be an exception but the vast majority of games go too long for me the feel of them and the things i do in them become redundant and i don t finish so i like that gun seemed manageable for the most part i was pleasantly full when i finished though perhaps finishing things was a little too cut and dried like the way you can get every upgrade possible the negative story it should have gone a bit lighter i mean it seemed to think it was some powerful clint eastwood directed western but unfortunatly computer games are not capable of pulling off anything nearly that sophisticated they just have too much on their plate vis a vis gameplay and choice the cutscenes and acting were nice and it started solidly but storywise it progressively deteriorated or i guess was completely unable to fufill its set up it gets a little hard to discuss without spoilers but well more romance would have been nice and the boss battle that goes on and on was not just difficult for me remember how i hate that but it was irritatingly stupid and senseless to the reality of the game conclusion wow only one big negative but the huge long ending boss battle really bugged me really good game though oh and by the way i have a pretty midlevel computer and fading fast and didn t have any real technical problems maybe a couple of ugly frame slowdowns but mostly it was smooth that s just you know for what that s worth anyway if some of what i am talking about makes sense to you go try this game out
0,i ordered this item about a month ago i got the package in about weeks and was so excited to open it i was like a year old who just got their first bike i opened the package to only find a the charger for the camera yes only the charger no camera to be found in the package i was so pissed i called amazon and asked them where the hell is my camera and this is what they said oh im sorry we probably forgot to put it into the package what kind of is that so i asked the guy to ship me a camera and to my luck their were no more in stock so i told the guy to forget it and for him to send me a return slip so that i can get my full dollars back because of your horrible terrible ridiculous service it is now feb and still no money back i keep calling them and they say the returned package is still in transit ive never heard of a package taking over a month to get to its destination but i could be wrong right i wouldnt be surprised if i never see my dollars again if i wanted to waste dollars like that i could have flushed them down the toilet what a rip off it was an amazon vendor as well q never again
0,well this was about as formulaically politically correct as a movie can get unfortunately the female teenage protagonist played by witherspoon whose acting powers have increased dramatically since her stilted acting here acts masculine and heroic the male teenage protagonist acts craven and flippant at one ridiculous point the girl runs around acting like a commando a veritable one gal army blowing up the bad guys while the boy hides in a cave sniveling later when the boy tries to assert himself by offering to carry the gal s backpack as they cross a desert the gal snaps at him bella abzug style and walks quickly ahead leaving him in the dust clearly a modern radical feminist thing going on here and what is most unfortunate is that this movie was made for a young audience and therefore is in keeping with the modern radical feminist propaganda which is brainwashing young women into unnaturally behaving like men of course in the real world the result for such manly girls once they become women is that men do not choose them and they remain alone and therefore become bitter ironically and inevitably blaming men of course in this movie the wimpy teenage guy falls for the brassy masculine gal but that s why they call them movies when are these post modern writers artists and other culture shapers with an agenda going to realize that when they tout modern radical feminism they are touting something unnatural men simply do not prefer masculine females men want someone to complement them not compete with them men crave femininity in females not feminism wow is there ever a difference in those two forms of comportment this poor teenage guy depicted in this movie at least his character does progress a little bit by the end of the movie instead of craven and flippant he graduates to something akin to a metrosexual type with a wild boy haircut if that is even a step upward but the plucky gal she s still the one in charge in this fictitious world of upside down gender relations uh another problem with this movie and there are many is when the kids are going through the kalahari desert something which should be and for a time is here depicted as a foreboding and life threatening task yet we see witherspoon in this desert frolicking with a dog and we see the boy s flippancy and joviality emerge in a totally out of place manner considering the dire situation they are in the sense of urgency which had been built up is totally excreted away by these light hearted inane scenes look i dig disney kid movies more realistic ones you know old style disney movies you take old yeller for example now there was a quality kid movie and quite true to life this movie was not it had a plastic spoiled american materialistic teenybopper feel throughout disney has gone down the tubes in any number of ways they ve been subverted by radical marxist agendas note one more of these was the fact that an african bushman was allowed to evince a pagan ritual from his pc pagan religion something called tapping while the caucasians were of course not shown evincing any sign of their un pc judeo christian religion this is bias folks leftwing pc bias same as the aforementioned feminist bilge i am learning to run not walk away from disney stuff and this movie was further cause for me to do so

1,i first came across taste of home magazine about years ago some friends of mine were quite the experimental couple who loved to try out new recipes as the recipient of tasty appetizers dips and desserts i asked them for the recipes it was then that they shared this magazine with me and i ve been a subscriber ever since each magazine features several special features as well as mainstay departments such as potluck pleasers my mom s best meal getting in the theme of things and super snacks and appetizers arguably the best part of this magazine is their clip and keep section of recipes which feature color photos of the dish just cut out the recipe and ouila it s ready for your recipe box other information packed sections include ask our food editor touring country kitchens ted s toothpick contest lively leftovers and more each issue also features a recipe contest to win cold hard cash some of the great recipes that are in the most recent issue include swiss stuffed porkchops open faced turkey tacos spinach shrimp fettuccine coffee n cream brownies cucumber potato salad asparagus chicken crepes hearty jambalaya barvarian strawberry pie and many more besides being tasty dishes one of the great things about the recipes in taste of home is that they don t call for some exotic ingredients rather they feature ingredients that can be found in any department store even if you live in an out of the way rural area some of the recipes aren t exactly quick which is why i give it four stars there are certainly quite a few quick and easy recipes but there are also some that take quite a bit of prep work if you re looking for a magazine with mostly quick recipes try their sister publication quick cooking i subscribe to that one as well and actually like it better taste of home has no ads amazing so it s nice that the magazine is chock full of recipes and information not fillers and ads this magazine also is very country so if you re looking for something trendy and cosmopolitan this mag may not be for you but if you like down home country cookin you ll likely love this magazine

1,these burgers are unbelievable they are really fresh and juicy burgers with a distinctive meaty taste you will fall in love with if you love a great burger they are omaha steaks best product and the only thing i order from them i actually love the packaging each burger comes individually wrapped in vacuum sealed plastic which means i can keep them in the freezer until i am ready to eat them then defrost them in warm water and in minutes i have fresh red meat they have a nice peppery angus beef smell and they taste great they never go to waste i find the meat i buy in the stores these days can t compare at all them smell of the meat doesn t smell fresh more like plastic than meat ok the styrofoam cooler is a waste of packaging and not environmentally friendly but they can be reused several times amazon also has a great price on these after a quick search around the web this looks to be the best price

1,i was actually surprised at how good the sound quality is from this icrib sound system it has very nice features like a or shutdown timer so you can put the baby to bed with music and then the icrib will shut down after the specified time the nightlight is also really neat as it cycles between four different colors the only problem with this product is that it cannot run on ac only on batteries so we ll be buying lots of batteries over the next couple of years but otherwise this is a great product edit after further consideration i would drop the rating to stars for two reasons first i have found the lack of an ac power source to be very inconvenient second as the batteries wear down the sound quality from the speakers deteriorates significantly

0,i wanted a high quality yoga mat that was long in length because i am a tall person i thought i had picked the perfect mat when i ordered this one i didn t have a problem with the length although it smelled that new plastic stench but i did have a problem with the weight this mat is heavy i knew it would be heavy when i purchased it and being a person in somewhat good shape i didn t think i would mind it but i didn t realize that it would be cumbersome the last straw that made me want to return it was when i was in a yoga class sweating and i began to slip on the mat if i am going to spend this amount of money on a yoga mat i don t want any problems to amazon s credit i was able to return it and they paid for postage if i would have had to pay for the return postage myself it would have cost a lot because of how heavy it is but i would have paid it anyway that should tell you how much i didn t like it i am now looking for a long mat but lighter and toxic free i want something that will be biodegradable the problem now is there are so many mats available too many choices can be just as frustrating as too few

1,title tablet publisher wacom publish date unknown isbn model reviewer robert saucier rating stars in after buying a new top of the line pentium ii system i splurged on a wacom artz ii tablet oh my pressure sensitive tilt sensing pointer control assignable function pads it was heaven after a couple of years every time i tried to use it with my primary graphics application my computer would spontaneously reboot a bit counter productive i watched for new drivers and new versions of my application but as technology marched on my beloved tablet and graphics application continued their spats sadly i disconnected the tablet and gently packed it away lately i ve been feeling the pull once more that urge to use a pen to do photo touch ups instead of my mouse miraculously a wacom inch by inch tablet dropped almost literally into my lap sleek gun metal gray sexy with a comfort grip pen much like my coveted pilot pens and a mouse even better the comes bundled with applications that show off its capabilities adobe elements corel painter essentials and nik color efex le heaven just got better the has over lines per inch of resolution over twice that of the wacom graphire product line and with its usb connection there s more than enough communication bandwidth meaning better tablet to application response one hesitation i have when adding a new piece of hardware is in regard to what the driver will do to my system will it introduce instability or get along with everyone else the driver has been rock solid in the two weeks that the tablet has been living with me i ve used all of my usual programs and have had no problems at all the tablet has also been peacefully co existing with two external drives a wireless desktop receiver a card reader a scanner and a printer all riding the same usb bus the has chordable buttons at each side of the tablet to which keys macros or other actions may be assigned the default for each group are the usual alt ctrl command and shift along with space the placement of the buttons allows you to keep a grip on the tablet holding one or more of the buttons while tapping whatever key on the keyboard with your pen hand being chordable you can hold any or all of the buttons down for those tricky shortcuts like alt ctrl s or to the side of each of the two button pads are touch strips which can be independently programmed as well the default setting is to scroll or depending on the context the ends of the strip in keystroke mode can be set to playback macros the pen with its level pressure sensitive stylus and eraser also has a duoswitch the duoswitch s two positions may also be programmed the pen action is smooth with the default nylon nib there are different types of nibs to simulate different types of tactile feedback with the ergonomic grip the pen is extremely comfortable to hold the button mouse designed to be used by either righties or lefties is not as ergonomically correct but considering the versatility this is more than acceptable as with every other clickable pressable feature associated with the the mouse buttons are programmable with a ridiculous number of options although i ve yet to find the fix photo illustrate article or even the design website settings i can see only two very minor changes that i would make to this fantastic product i would love to see the ability to add weight to the pen it is just a bit too light for my personal tastes and considering how configurable the tablet is already this feature would be the feather on the cap to me the other change would be making the drawing surface transparent as it is on the graphire and was on the artz ii sometimes having the ability to trace an outline can save significant time for the casual home user i would recommend the graphire product line this model s srp of may be a bit high where a entry point on the graphire is more affordable for the pro consumer or professional however whether doing photo editing my primary use or illustration the line is well worth the investment it s great to be in heaven again

1,this horn set is a good deal at the amazon price and with no sales tax and free shipping it is about cheaper than the local auto store i purchased this as the second replacement for a toyota the compressors tend to rust since they are exposed to water kicked up from roads this compressor looks better sealed so that might make it last longer most japanese cars come with weak horns and this set makes up for them they tend to scare the unwary a good thing the installation is straight forward but does require connecting electrical wires and mounting the relay compressor and horns to keep it simple i tapped off the existing horn wire ran a ground wire to an existing screw and used existing holes in the body panels

0,i couldn t get past the very stylized dialogue which seemed to coming from the same source although different actors were speaking the characters are cliches through and through and does anyone really speak the way the people do mamet appears to have never left manhattan and has no clue to writing non urban roles or a script with enough nuance to delineate his characters perspective to be honest i didn t finish the entire film but instead checked the tv guide for reruns of northern exposure for the real thing

0,i have to wonder what world what physical plane what state of mind were the reviewers here who gave this a good review on or maybe they are full moon employees lol first of all the movie especially one of the earlier scenes was identical to the s flick the unnamable which is also and hp lovecraft based flick the castle freak itself looked like a bad halloween rubber suit when he breaks out his cell well this was just hilarious it reminded me of the incredible hulk yes jeffrey combs is in it but his acting is cheesy as it can be hunt down the unnamable instead a much better movie

0,i rented this movie for about six dollars and i have to say even that was a waste of money i thought this movie was incredibly over acted boring and hard on the eyes the thing that annoyed me the most was the monologues that each of the main characters did they were exaggerated and reminded me of the kind of acting you would find in a infomercial for the superficial people out there i wouldn t watch this movie hoping for eye candy because you won t get it when i found out that the two women starring actually wrote and directed the film it finally made sense why the acting was so horrible i have no idea why this movie has any stars at all it was horrible and that would be considered a compliment

1,the grand theft auto series and the playstation have gone hand in hand which each game debuting on the before it travels to other consoles that all changed with the release of last year s side story grand theft auto liberty city stories this game designed to take advantage of the psp s hardware was an impressive technical feat managing to pack in a lot of what made the big gta games so memorable but it fell short in a few key spots most notably the story the characters and the series biting sense of style and satire that stuff was easy to overlook when you could carry liberty city around in your back pocket but on the where you can compare it directly to the three grand theft auto games that have appeared there the whole package is significantly less interesting even considering the port s budget price not much has changed so if you ve already played this on the psp there s not much reason to take on the version the game s got a slightly longer draw distance on the playstation and the streets look like they might have a few more people on them but neither of these things dramatically changes the game and they can t save the game s otherwise murky visuals and often poor frame rate but it also controls a little better with the right analog stick back in effect you ve got all the camera control and other buttons you re used to hitting on the it s neither elegant nor particularly noteworthy but if you didn t play it on the psp liberty city stories price tag is just right just don t go in expecting anything approaching the grandiose nature of gtaiii let alone the bigger crazier vice city or san andreas and if you ve already played it on the psp well there s little reason to play it again because this is the same game with the multiplayer modes stripped out as a return to liberty city the new york themed locale first made famous back in grand theft auto iii liberty city stories is all about retreading through well worn territory if you still remember the streets of liberty city you ll see plenty of the same spots here but as a game that was designed for the less powerful psp you ll probably notice that liberty city stories is much smaller in scope than what we ve seen in the series more recently missions which grew to epic proportions in san andreas are much shorter and feel pretty meaningless in lcs there are plenty of moments where you ll complete a mission and immediately think well at least i ll never have to do that again the story however is the biggest casualty liberty city stories tells the tale of one toni cipriani a regular type mob guy who did a good deed for the head of the leone crime family salvatore leone toni had to go away for awhile but the heat s died down and he s back on the job in liberty city maintaining his loyalty to sal while wiping out the family s enemies in droves along the way as you ascend to become salvatore s right hand man you ll start and finish gang wars with other mafia types a few triads the yakuza pretty much all of the usual suspects are present if you re familiar with the various mafia presences over the course of the past three gta games you ll recognize a few of the names and faces here but the story stands alone and doesn t require you to remember the various cast members that s a good thing because the mafia characters in the other gta games have been largely forgettable the game s storyline really isn t up to par with the console installments in the series because very little actually happens even potential plot points are squandered like when toni finally becomes a made man but a bad cutscene doesn t actually show the ceremony the game s mission path doesn t deviate into crazy territory and most of the characters are fairly lifeless there are no enigmatic weirdos like truth the crazy hippie from san andreas or steve scott the porno director from vice city to break up the heavier handed mafia tasks this dulls the game s personality preventing its characters and events from becoming as memorable as we ve come to expect from gta games and their excellent storylines
1,we got this bike for our year old and it is sturdy and rugged enough to last the next few years the assembly instructions looked intimidating at first but since many pieces are already pre assembled you can skip most of them it was a lot easier than anticipated the only reason why i gave it stars it had a deep scratch paint chip on the frame but since i got this during a sale for a great price and considering it was needed the next day we kept it anyway
0,to anyone who buys this toy keep the box and receipt handy we may be the odd one out but we purchased this toy and it didn t work the legs on manny are to be pulled back to fire a rubber ball this didn t happen rapid pushing and pulling of his legs produces rapid fire and if we were lucky one would shoot out after great effort it comes with three foam balls two of which fit the third was slightly too big and would jam ours is going back to the store today
0,i agree almost completely with this ugle production looks like it was from the s and gianni s is downright embarrassing the costuming there makes everyone look absurd tabarro has little passion most of the time but the singing is good angelica is okay but it is not a part for plowright and i definitely did not like dunja vejzovic as the princess it is great to have this opera on dvd but otherwise it was a big disappointment no goosebumps here i just finished watching my old tape from of the met broadcast with scotto in all three of the acters what a delight some weak points here and there but it has passion in spades and that s what these need scotto was incredible in suor angelica we should be so lucky to have these performances released on dvd but that is highly unlikely i ve given this la scala dvd stars but that is probably being generous
0,i bought leappad plus writing on impulse at the store wanting to help my son with writing phonics etc he used it a few times but i almost have to beg for him to use it and that s sad i wish i would have gotten the original leappad or perhaps even the leapster for one thing the book doesn t recognize all pencil movements a child could make an incorrect number or letter and it doesn t seem that the leappad would recognize it also the child has to keep erasing over and over providing limited usage not only that there are only a few books published with leappad writing in mind and the exercises are repetitive e g writing the number ten times i ve bought quite a few leappad books and quantum pad books for my son and he is just not interested after initial use i m sure he s learned a little bit of phonics using the phonics books and such but i think he learns more from workbooks bought at a bookstore or a department store and they re cheaper not only that leappad books are very short much shorter than workbooks you can buy considering that leappad books are usually around a pop and that amazon doesn t carry list them all and there is a very limited selection in stuff mart type stores at least that s the case in my geographical area you may want to re consider investing in the leappad system
0,this a mystery triller starring tom berenger gretta scacchi corbin bernsen joanne whalley kilmer and bob hoskins it s the story of a couple who for some reason plunge off a cliff and survive she falls out of the car early but he is trapped in and falls drastically crashing all the way she maintains a black and blue and a bruised arm while he amazingly lives at first leaving him in a coma but more importantly leaving his face looking like hamburger he eventually comes out of his coma to find that he has amnesia later after being nursed back to health and falling in love with his wife all over again he finds a roll of film of his wife having sex with another man obviously this makes him question what really happened before the crash and he hires a private investigator to help him find the truth it sounds good and starts off as a pretty good thriller but comes predictable fast i knew the key mysteries almost immediately and i m sure that those who have seen hundreds of movies and law order episodes will agree eventhough it is predictable and the movie goes downhill at a certain point it does have some moments i liked bob hoskins and his role especially but have no reason to ever see this again
1,i just rebuilt the genesis i it didnt need the igniter as it lit on the first click every time anyway but changed it as it was years old or so also changed the flavorizor bars as they were about worn away

1,the build a figure baf program of marvel legends keeps on rocking this time build a giant apocalypse this baf is big and cool super articulated with sculpt and paint fine enough to be a sculpture for apocalypse stars for iron fist well he s super articulated and does come with the mighty booty that s the buttocks of apocalypse but really is the weakest figure in this series a lot of that is just charater design though green tights with an open v neck green shirt and what is that tattoo supposed to be anyway ballet slippers and a dew rag pretty horrible looking if you can try to find the red suit variant at least that s a little cool also the accesories besides the booty are two rubbery flames to fit into his hands to give a fire fist effect good luck with that they are kind of flimsy and hard to place in the hands once you get them in you better not touch the figure again or they will fall off overall not the quatlity of figure or accesories i d expect but the rest of the figures in the series will make up for this one plus you do still get that booty
0,i really tried to come to this movie with and open mind i m a huge fan of jane austen and i thought the bbc miniseries actually came close to doing justice to her novel still i was looking foreward to seeing a new interpretation unfortunately this one seemed to miss the point of the story jane austen had a hilarious way of satarizing the social conventions and mores while being in their midst this film ignores the social conventions altogether and therefore misses a great deal of austen s humor for example an unmarried man and woman would never greet each other in their pajamas a man would never visit his fiancee while she was lying sick in bed in her nightgown when these rules of propriety are ignored by the film how are we supposed to understand or believe that it s a big deal when lydia runs away with wickham another example is lady catherine this is a woman who lives and dies by her snobbery and rigorous adherance to social conventions yet in this film we see her barge into the bennet household in the middle of the night and wake lizzie up to ask a question that could easily waited until morning when lady catherine wouldn t have had to get her carriage driver out of bed to drive several miles in the dark no streetlights remember to the bennet household because no one adhere s to societies rigorous and for the most part arbitrary rules the movie misses the opportunies to subtly wink at the audience as it laughs at such things another weakness lies in the casting granted these actors had big shoes to fill colin firth and jennifer ehle seemed to embody their characters in the miniseries but as i said there are other ways to interpret and play the characters unforunately here everyone seems as if they re reading lines with dramatic inflection not acting you can almost imagine keira knightly s script having notes saying insert spunkiness here while the scenery is lovely the windswept cliff and farm images seem to recollect the tortured landscape of a bronte adaptation more than a manacured austen setting overall this film comes off as one big missed opportunity
0,i bought this software because i really wanted to learn spanish and be fluent the price and marketing of the company made me believe that this package was the most complete package on the market so i was very excited to receive it after spending on a software my excitement did not last long after that i was shocked to see how the software itself looked i was expecting a top of the line interface for the price i paid but that software seemed years old but i still wanted to get my money worth so tried the first level for hours even days as i was convinced i could learn spanish with it i also tried the other levels to make sure that my issue was not only with that first level i had looked at the demo and noticed that most of the content was based on that same acitivity with the pictures i was expecting different exercises for the full version the software gets so repetitive i was really disappointed even more because of the outrageous price of that package
0,i had to read this book as part of a masters level class on organizational management i would offer it up for sale but i intend to burn it when class is over unless you want to read a book written by people who are so much better than you are he said with an extra helping of sarcasm do yourself a favor and skip this book it a bunch of religous self righteous fairy tale dogma horrible horrible book will look nice when it s burnt to a crisp however
0,i wish they had a rating for zero stars i bought the fifty pack and had good burns and coasters that s a success rate i subsequently bought verbatim data life and have burned so far with no coasters memorex has really gone downhill
1,i didn t have a ton of time to research this flash i ve used it now on several occasions with my canon and couldn t be happier with it it s great for shooting portraits i can shoot shots in a row and the flash keeps up i would definitely purchase the plastic diffuser get s rid of the typical flash harsh light

0,i was first introduced to the symphonic power metallers formerly known as rhapsody name changed due to copyright issues on their live album live in canada i have to say that i am just not that impressed or entertained by their latest studio effort the group tends to rely more or the theatrical elements rather than focusing on their metal music the vocals tend to be oversung or drowned out by the chaos in the background rather than enhancing your metal experience with musical theatrical elements rhapsody of fire puts you to sleep with them the group does stay true to their fantasy themes however
0,the singing is terrible on fly me to the moon don t take my word for it listen to the free sample supplied by amazon com at seconds into it when she sings all i worship and adore she goes almost a whole note sharp for several notes even someone with no musical training can hear it the rest of the pieces sound fine

1,peter balakian s book black dog of fate tries to be too many things and sadly fails at many of them in essence it is an attempt to tell a sort of armenian american story which i find not overly interesting or compelling i wish the author had done a bit more in depth work to learn about his people and their rich heritage before embarking to represent it or explain it or share it with non armenians for he has much more to absorb and understand himself first i find the armenianness in this book to be tentative unengaged and unconvincing pity since the author seems to have a lot of passion in his pursuit of other aspects of his life such as football the yankees modern poetry and exposing turkish attempts to buy among others princeton professors to act as mouthpieces giving legitimacy to their vile historical revisionism practiced by the modern turkish state and its organs it seems to be all the rage these days to elevate personal histories and family testimonials into the realm of fiction and novels the i and we and us occupy center stage and the reader is invited to enjoy the intimacy that must surely be in place via this artifice but is it realy since in order to make this legitimate the writer must distance himself at least initially from all this old world exotica and like the reader question their validity or relevance in present day north american society what are all these old world old fashioned ghosts and traditions is the first cry of writer and reader alike only ofcourse to be followed by a sharp bank turn where the writer steers the satisfied and in place reader towards the opposite viewpoint wherein this culture and this lifestyle become suspect in light of some tentative spotting of cultural wealth that has been traded in or abandoned in order to swim swiftly towards materialistic memory free self redefining comfort seeking and buying mores in the balakian tale one encounters suburbia instead of substance worldly goods acquisition instead of deep roots that steady the soul immediate family and relatives running away from their true identities either towards surrealism the abstract and unemotional or else towards medicine respectability and detachment young balakian observes but never understands the grandmother for she is shielded culturally from being able to reach him by her very offsprings who can not and will not instill the armenian identity he will eventually seek but never quite find their crime is self denial and a march to the tune of america s mixmaster piper be unlike your past and your future will be brighter seems to be what america promises at the very least the intermediate generation listens and adopts this credo and peter is left to find out but never quite understand just what cost his ancestors have paid to remain armenian and to preserve our culture before the final denials on new jersey pateos while enjoying as if to serve sweet irony full course armenian meals and the mixing aromas of delicacies from the old country every sunday peter is lost alright but as the book sadly shows he remains lost paraphrasing or quoting ambassador morgenthau does not an armenian genocide expert make personal family testimonials of the turkish atrocities does not a genocide history make for that read vahakn dadrian s the history of the armenian genocide berghahn books episodic accounts can be dismissed by the turks as hear say and as mere isolated incidents leading to more harm than good for if better evidence existed the arguement goes why would anyone resort to such flimsy fare for the story to have worked for the story to have really worked as i would have liked it to balakian s life and lifestyle would have had to have changed significantly and his child rearing practices would have had to reflect it and his relationship with his wife who like him is not leading a strongly armenian existence would have had to have changed solidifying his roots celebrating his new found identity and nurturing the metamorphosis by sustained community involvment and grass roots movement participation which alas never appear on the pages of this book how else to explain the lack of a turning around of the tide of assimilation to which balakian is a grand personal witness except that the transition has not occured the ship of armenianness sails by balakian he is finally aware enough to be able to identify the ship and wave it goodbye and write about it but not resolved enough to climb aboard that is how the book fails and that is how his story fails this is a story of assimilation and loss with a bit of mid stream self awareness thrown in for a real story of an armenian finding his roots and letting them take root in his own life and future read mark arax s book in my father s name simon schuster where the transition is real and the early youth of disaffection is replaced by a profound adoption of our essence revealed in exquisite frankness and power by mark arax one can only hope that balakian s partial reorientation towards our culture and traditions and essence will somehow continue and that some day he will wish to live with a more meaningful attachment to our cause and needs than merely as an able observer not withstanding his laudible actions as an april armenian genocide commemoration speaker and an exposer of turkish infiltration in the us academic arena by buying spokesmen turned professors who mascarade as unbiased researchers this criticism i direct to the predecessor of this genre of american armenian writing first and to balakian second i speak here of passage to ararat by michael arlen hungry mind republication where a disinterested soit disant armenian goes to armenia in the s and by the end of the short trip is somewhat more closely touched by this strange people s woes and dreams too little too late and always detached is all i can say to these meagre displays of ethnic or cultural reorientation much more needs to be absorbed before the essence is transmitted to future generations to take and behold however i remain hopeful that future transformatory stories and ethnic identity survival stories will be written which will show that the tide of assimilation and cultural abandonment are not the only outcome of this experiment of transplanting peoples and cultures to this continent we proudly call our home
0,a tenor very quickly on the rise this is villazon s second recital disc one devoted to arias by gounod and massenet all in sets of three three for massenet and two for gounod while still showing great promise some concerns that were mildly serious with the first disc are even more so in the french repertoire in part because diction comes up so short here o souverain from le cid continues to show villazon s command of line and squeezed but adequately forceful upper register so that the volume boosts from the control room are really unnecessary diction here is already an issue as many u vowels get dipthonged especially when villazon s sound is placed back for added weight and volume la reve from massenet s manon is comfortably floated with support from natalie dessay as manon enhancing the intimacy of feeling to this number would villazon been able to sing the short aria by alain who appears to the heroine at first to perhaps be little more than an apparition shades of frau ohne schatten perhaps in almost a chamber opera from massenet s griselidis track at least as softly and lightly as both the music and dramatic situation require this could have also been very successful he instead turns the aba shape of this mere chanson inside out and makes a wreck of it the less often excerpted lorsque enfant from werther closes out the first massenet set as does pourquoi me reveiller the second villazon s identification with the distraught main character of this opera is abundantly clear in both he capitalizes well on the quixotic emotions and dreamy tendencies of the distraught main character especially well in the first selection and he is also less intruded upon by the producers or sound engineers there as well it is quite curious how the control room follows the tenor up a crescendo on a line that closes out the first section of the excerpt here from massenet s roi de lahore featuring a hero from hindu myth that bound to certain stipulations has literally returned from the dead not quite as ostentatious as massenet s near remake of lohengrin esclarmonde but with female protagonist instead it is one of massenet s most colorful scores it has only been recorded complete once commercially with joan sutherland luis lima and appearing only ten minutes apart james morris and for the part of general unfortunately eliminated from this scene here john tomlinson along with one other cut to villazon s part it would ve been more valuable to have all this complete instead of one or two other arias he captures the incipiently worried tone of alim well but his coloring up the vowel sounds makes it seem that he has come from a place as remote from french culture as where the opera takes place most successful of the gounod selections are two of the three rarities the first is source delicieuse from polyeucte based on the corneille play it opens very well with a minute of orchestral cortege it perhaps has only been recorded once before and well by roberto alagna ten years ago villazon conveys the heroism of the piece somewhat well if not as securely as alagna anges du paradis from mireille which mirella freni championed and recorded complete for emi is third perhaps a study for ah leve toi soleil romeo several years down the road the second gounod rarity on this disc is inspirez moi race divine said to be a caruso favorite from reine de saba its text indicates king solomon s prize hired builder adoniram to be a very confident if mildly haughty chap villazon s interpretation seems to portray a hero that constantly has to look behind his back with all the incipiently yet controllably vibrato ridden throb and backphrasing villazon engages in here the high c at the end however is convincing such device as in the above also accents and colors most phrasing in the tomb scene from romeo et juliette ah leve toi soleil opens the first gounod set and is sung with the right ardor conventionally marked by tiny captured scoops coming off phrases villazon s entrance and two later lines catch for having placed so far back in the throat and intonation gets momentarily derailed salut demeure from gounod s faust quickly becomes expressively leaden and monochrome recitative and the beginning of the aria ah fuyez from manon begin well nuanced enough and for the aria truly softly as a change from so much else on this disc but all purpose bench pressing and volume boosts intrude before long that leaves two truly atmospheric selections from two massenet rarities to close this recital first an aria from roma massenet s swan song for the lyric theater and ah parais from le mage opera with plot line similar to that of verdi s aida following the melody introduced by the cellos at the outset for the latter somewhat takes after pays merveilleux from meyerbeer s africaine but in more voluptuous color such as in thais and villazon and pido both capitalize well on its opulence pido s work on numerous other numbers on this disc seems heavy lumbering cloying or just simply out of his idiom so to speak word has it that villazon while not having a big voice is dramatically exciting on stage and probably more immediately engaged with the content of what he is singing how this picked up a major award from gramophone for the specific problems this disc has and over two more qualified nominations ciofi di donato handel duets and a florez album is mystifying so much digression here is over the very specific demands that french opera makes on singers there s much reason for hope for this tenor but this disc for two thirds of it does little to help fulfill it
1,i originally bought this cd case for my car because i listen to cds the most while driving this was not a good case to bring back and forth at all it is very large and heavy even without cds and the long zipper tail makes it hard to open with one hand i now use it to house computer software and playstation gamecube games for what you pay it is an excellent buy
0,this was given to me as a gift and although i have used it it would not be my first choice in infant care the nail clippers are mediocre at best i understand they shouldn t be sharp for an infant but i have to exert tremendous pressure just to clip my son s nails the syringe is too hard of a push to administer medicine and the tweazers couldn t pull a hair out of my head they have absolutely no grip i have never used the brush comb or toothbrush i have others but they do make for good entertainment when diapering the case is cumbersome and of poor design everytime i open it everything falls out
1,this is the author s presentation of the satipatthana sutra the basic sutra on mindfullness as in all of his works he does the work of a good dharma teacher very well he keeps his own personality and teaching idiosyncrasies out of the way so that the student s understanding can arise naturally there are more elaborate and academic descriptions of the sutra available and more detailed descriptions of how to use the sutra in meditation but this is good basic information presented in a good manner with no frills or personal quirks the author gives a good commentary on the sutra and explains why he translates certain passages but he also gives the alternate interpretations this is a fine basic introduction to the central issue in vapassana meditation highly recommended
0,i think i understand what camp is the damned is a film taking upon itself the allegorical rise and fall of nazi germany in such an overindulgent manner that one cringes and giggles at the same time i guess gay folks everywhere can blame luchino visconti the great director for making a laughing stock out of homosexuals in nazi ss garb mel brooks realized in his film the producers that nazi s are damn funny but not even brook s vision could foresee the downfall of the essenbeck family as the currents of early nazi bloodshed swirls about the uniforms are art deco at its worst the young blonde aryan cross dressers are a bathhouse dream until they re lined up against the wall rome may have had caligula but the reich had blonde pedophiles what a thrill to see helmut berger swishing about in marlene dietrich bodice and stockings i watched the whole thing and i m going to end this review to take a shower

1,so this controller looked pretty sweet to me so i bought it over a rumble pad i liked the idea of fans for wicking away sweat as i tend to get pretty white knuckled on my controllers i bought this controller specifically for star wars battlefront on pc and it works like a dream i also like the x box controller layout offset anolog sticks and more ergonomic than the style controller that is the logitech rumble pad it also has better grips than a controller the only things i think are bad about it are the following it is not modeled on the large xbox controller but rather the regular one which is ok for most people but i have big hands and i get a bit cramped up if i play for way too long i was slightly dissapointed with the lack of custimization software available with this pad i have a saitek cyborg evo joystick that you can create custom profiles for every game you want to use it with then set that profile before launching the game this isn t an issue with battlefront since it has a very excellent in game control configurator but i could see where if a game didn t have as good an interface or maybe older games this pad could suffer in this regard this isn t so much an issue for me but i would assume that with a lot of game play and turning on and off of the fan that the fan motor will likely die sooner than the pad will wear out i don t care too much because the fan is more a novelty to me than anything i will still use it even if it does die overall a great controller i actually would give it a rating but that isn t an option here

1,this is a nice addition to anyone s patio the product came very well packaged in heavy duty double boxes with the legs wrapped in padded paper assembly took around minutes as others have commented the holes don t line up naturally and did require some finessing in order to get lined up but really wasn t that difficult to overcome all that is required for assembly is a allen wrench which is provided although the end started to get worn way through the assembly and required me to use another wrench probably one of the nicest features of the table are adjustable levelers on the legs this seems like a good quality that i am confident will last for many years to come

0,on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums i think it is shaker it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert that should have been as far as it went to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at bucks a crack is highway robbery if these are blues songs then i am robert johnson s illegitimate son death letter is good maybe even great but cannot compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard the rest is a waste of time the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd these are my first reviews by the way but all these star reviews for both cd s finally got me motivated go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save bucks in the bargain

0,this is a very cheaply made product that does not stand up to any child play my sons got this recently and within hours one of the sticks had broken the company was nice enough to send a new one out but now only a few weeks later the plastic on the goal is shattered the goal also does not stay together very well and comes apart with each goal scored overall i would highly discourage you from wasting quite a bit of money for plastic that will not hold up to child play

0,completely worthless if you liked the film go buy the dvd because this album has no redeeming qualities the sound quality is fair at best even for a live album almost every track is jammed with totally worthless commentary at the beginning or end of the song the commentary consists of recordings of about a dozen people having random conversations over the phone and laughing for no reason it would have been nice if they had put these commentaries on different tracks because the way they have it on this cd you have to wait through about a minute and a half of this crap to get to the song you want to hear the worst part about the album is the lack of the fugees which means no killing me softly sadly you can tell that most of the artists on this album haven t played a show or practiced in a long time as they are a bit rusty and sound horrible even for a live recording some of them sounded almost as bad as fallout boy on snl

0,i recently bought a new celestron nexstar telescope and this eyepiece accessory kit much to my disappointment the eyepieces in this kit did not fit very well into the eyepiece holder of the telescope and when cold nights in colorado are the eyepieces did not fit at all celestron customer service was horrible and did not pay attention to my problem and did not follow up by email as promised when i called a second time they had no clue about the construction of the eyepieces and no thoughts about how to fix this problem amazon replaced the kit thank you amazon but the replacements did not fit either i m returning that kit too i finally bought a kit from meade eyepieces and a moon filter that fit properly and are very easy to use to be fair if these eyepieces fit your telescope then they are a tremendous value hence the rating of stars rather than the meade kit is a worse value but because they work in my nice new scope they are the best for anyone using a nexstar

0,while i can t agree with the other reviewer re the quality of the jeans it seems excellent to me having owned six pairs over the last two years which i wear to work every day and certainly as men s jeans i don t think they re out of style i do have to say amazon s price on this item is far far out of line you can find these same jeans online elsewhere for with free or cheap shipping meaning the cost is nearly less than what amazon is charging
1,i bought the lotion and the moisurizing gel about weeks ago which is wonderful but passed on the soap i m a teenager who has a slight problem with acne so that s why i bought the neutrogena acne wash instead which has salicylic acid that will help for acne by itself the acne wash does not work but so far with the clinique i have not broken out at all not a single pimple everything is smooth and toned i love my skin and it glows i recommend getting the milder lotion for people with fairer and more sensitive skin as this is known to peel and cause redness to some the salicylic acid is necessary for me and my light breaks out during that time of month skin so if you do not have an acne problem i think any soap is alright to anyone who is worried about spending too much money if it does not work for you there is a guarantee that lets ou get all your money back it s great
0,i ordered this guitar for my grandson for christmas there is no way to keep the strings tight even though you turn the screws to tighten when you do tighten the strings are brittle as if really old and break to get a refund on this item you have to obtain an rma pay for return shipping which will probably be almost as much as the guitar and they will issue a refund after they receive the guitar back so i will probably be out about
1,i really like this phone its cute its little its perfect for a young woman i had a pocket pc prior to this and it was so complicated just making a call i wanted something simple that wasn t an player i have an ipod that wasn t a professional camera i have a nice digital cam or a pda i have a palm tx its just simple and cute its bluetooth compatible although doesnt work that great with my bluetooth but i m not sure if its the headset or the phone the ringer on it is super quiet almost to the point you can barely hear it in your purse i m grown accustomed to listening for the vibrate feature instead i like how you can put a person s picture next to their name in your contact list i can wear it in the back pocket of my jeans and its comfortable sound quality is good on both ends i dig it im sure you will too

0,if you ve read anything already about these techniques writing it down visualizing it tithing this book offers no additional insights and despite his official religious disclaimer at the beginning of the book it is packed to the rafters with the author s own religious dogma if you share the author s religious outlook you may like this book but otherwise it makes for very tedious reading

0,i am a low income disabled person and require copious amounts of bathroom reading material wired is even too tedious to fill that need its sponsors tend to run the lengthy ads reminiscent of old picture filled national geographics of questionable scientific value on the other hand the articles for example in the latest issue are higher gas prices good for us paraphrase of title offer little information and if i had time to do the research this one is particularly like a sheaf of nixon press releases in conjunction with the announced operation independance the intention at the time was to free the u s from dependance on foriegn oil oh we of short memory condemned to sacrifice our sons and now daughters of interest may be the dumb means by which i obtained an unending subscription to this and some other almost as pointless magazines playstation magazine now x box magazine the completely amoral men s health garden club cooking i simply check the highest income level on every form i fill out on the internet and everything else short of a tax form or loan application typical of something recieved for nothing wired is not a publication for which i would recommend laying out any money or time including bathroom time
1,my family and i absolutly loved the sinamon flavor of lesserevil popcorn great flavor and the box was enough for a movie with the family was it healthy well it was better than movie theatre popcorn for sure but it is called lesserevil not completely wholesome and good for you good stuff overall and amazon s price is great just make sure you like the flavor first because you hav e to buy a cas
1,on this album ice switches to a thrashcore style lovers of the style will go mad about the songs are mega fast with furious social lyrics and full of hatred if you re into thashcoreand dig bands like ratos de porao get this one at once it suffers from some degree of dynamic compression though but if you can correct that it ll blow your brains againt the nearest wall
1,when it comes to the gc gba cable you wouldnt think that something this inexpensive could make a difference in the way you play video games but it does it unlocks secrets of all kinds in gamecube games sometimes it gives you access to secret areas maps items and various other thing depending on the game and what features it opens up plus it is cheap to get and once you ve gotten this wonderful item you will wonder why you didnt get it sooner i know from my own experience
1,i have used this bench for a little over a week for the price you can t go wrong it is sturdy and seems to be well made the adjustment is smooth and locks firmly in place great for lying leg lifts all and all this is a good bench i would have given it five stars but the description says it can be fully up right for use during military presses this is not true it can almost go vertical but not completely still i think you would be happy with it i am
1,about years ago i began getting ingrown whiskers on my neck from shaving not only did they not feel good they d itch and were sensitive but they looked horrible the front of my neck was red and i would have horrible red and white bumps all over the skin where whiskers would curl and grow back down into the skin i was totally self concsious because it looked horrible the only thing i could for the longest time was pluck them with tweezers that took a lot of time and digging into my skin to pull the hairs was very uncomfortable and really didn t work that well i tried switching to an electric razor with little success i could not have a close shave on my neck without getting the horrible ingrown hairs i searched the web for months to try and find something that would work i found some advice for a few different things but none worked i finally ran across a website of a distributor that was selling tend skin by that point i wasn t sure anything would work but i was desperate for something so i bought it i am so glad i did it really works when you use it as directed and you see results by the time you have to shave again i apply tend skin with a cotton ball or pad to my neck after i shave and dry my face i will then apply it again in the evening and repeat each morning and night it does not take much at all i always buy the largest bottle for fear that one day tend skin will disappear if you have ingrown facial hair from shaving you need to get this it is the only thing that i have found the works and i am happy with it it is rather pricey but i never hesitate to buy because it is worth every penny to me the only small complaint i have about it is that it smells just a tad funny to me my wife says it smells fine to her so i don t worry about it i wonder if they could make it with a slightly nicer smell or none at all it really doesn t matter though because tend skin is awesome and i don t know what i d do without it i can t speak to how effective it is for ingrown leg hair etc but i would imagine it would work the same
1,this brush is just awesome and a good price to boot works perfect with my weber q grill
0,i m very disappointed with this shredder i got it back in october and i have only used it about or times first of all although the product is supposed to shred up to sheets at a time it does not it will get jammed so i only shred or sheets at a time tonight i used it again and it became completely jammed from a few sheets i cannot get it to work again it is very loud and a bit slow but i can live with that i just don t like the fact that it jams after only using it a few times i recommend others spend a few extra dollars and get a reliable shredder unlike the royal sheet crosscut shredder
0,i am a person who actually uses these items alot after weeks of using these headphones the right earpiece quit playing and i hear ms is not suppporting anything that stops operating also it is too expensive i am enjoying the zune but all the accessories should be a little more accessible

1,i must admit i read many other reviews of this item and was a little apprehensive however i found this recorder to be outstanding in all the items i ve tried so far i initially just hooked it up like my old one was and left it for a few hours after manually setting the time before reading the instructions this made things more difficult so i started over set it for everything to be automatic including the time left it until the next evening and allowed it to do its thing which it did magnificently everything worked beautifully and it did a great job i love the one touch recording i found it s best to read directions one at a time as i want to try something new and have had no problems so far i haven t tried everything it will do but find it s very intuitive and not a bit frustrating to use it s a joy to hit the tvguide button highlight the shows i want to watch and hit the record button so far i have no complaints
1,this watch is great looks great and feels great the hands clicking sound is almost none overall nice watch very happy with it
1,i ve never had to use this product and don t ever want to but it s hefty enough to do the job keep it in your console box or velcro it close by not in the glove compart where you can t reach it when needed price is right i ve ordered one for each member of my family they say it s the best gift so far i think that s because it s the thought that counts
1,i love this sling but i d like to stress as other people have done that you have to practice with it to find what works for you it may be too big for your newborn i started using it when my son was weeks but he was a large baby i ve found the key is wear it high the instructions say the you and your baby will be more comfortable with baby at chest height it s true if you try to wear it with the baby hanging a little lower near your stomach it s going to hurt your back and shoulder and wear you out and he she s going to squirm and be uncomfortable i used it every day of my sons month when we were in hotels between moving now i used it every time i grocery shop because as soon as he s in it he falls asleep no matter the time of day if i try to push him through the whole store sitting in the cart in his carseat he ll start screaming but if i put him in my sling i won t hear a peep out of him the whole trip and you have to admit it s so cute and stylish several people have stopped to ask me where i got it and i love directing them to amazon

1,i really like this case it is easy to put on and take off it does not have that stupid plastic cover over the screen it does not add a lot of bulk to my phone and i think it makes my phone easier to hold i would like for more colors i would really like for something to glow in the dark so that i could find it easier in the black hole that is my purse
1,through much prayer and research i was lead to this book after reading it i understand the four step approach and can use it in all my educational experiences for my children i felt so much more comfortable homeschooling my children i felt i had really been taught how to homeschool it is not only informative but interesting a rare combination in how to books

1,wonderful it could only be improved if it came with a packet of rice like the other entrees do
0,contrary to the product description this stool is not heavy duty the actual seat itself is made of very flimsy plywood and any sort of bad posture or leaning forward will crack it and punch the metal supports through it the legs are also hard to adjust to optimum length as the retention screw doesn t hold anything in place for long if you can find something somewhere else i say go for it
0,i ve read and enjoyed all the starfist novels this is one of them in name only it starts like a typical starfist novel and even ties in some references to charlie bass and high level politicians but there the similarity ends i never did figure out what the author s point was except perhaps to rake in some quick cash the men of the fist are hard working hard fighting marines who trace an honorable history back to the us marines of the century these force recon marines are a ruthless bunch of screw ups who could trace their ancestry back to the waffen ss rather than root for them i soon found myself rooting for the opposition they invade a fellow member of the confederation screw up their primary assignment fail to get the info they were sent for kill allied soldiers and airmen murder helpless civilian prisoners and assinate the leader of a confederation allied state someone should remind the authors that recon is about getting accurate timely information it s not about blowing things up i really wasted my money on this book i definitely won t be the first lemming off the cliff the next time these authors have something to peddle
1,this dvd along with her international albums pure and odyssey are best stress reduction kits available in the market slip this in a dvd player and in a matter of minutes stress level heart rate and blood pressure all three are down and life if manageable again
1,this is a great product the only reason i don t give it a full five stars is that it is alleged to not have significant amounts of vitamin e which is supposed to be its selling point i however buy it because for the five years or so that i have used this product i have gotten a lot of compliments about the firmness of my skin and since i have started using it my skin has actually become less oily than when i first started using it i first purchased this product because of some damage i had done to my skin using a popular acne product my skin looked and felt as though i had been burned by acid i promptly stopped using that product and purchased this cream along with the cream cleanser because i hoped these products would be soothing they definitely were within a matter of weeks my skin started to feel better moreoever it took on a plump more youthful appearance no sagging within a month or so my skin was much less oily than it had been since i first purchased this product i have strayed but have always come back in the winter i use the heavier nightcream and have experienced the same results the regular cream is pink in color and does not smell of perfume texture wise it is heavier than a lotion but still feels slippery to the touch i highly recommend you try this cream
0,i received emails about delaying my order three times since it showed that the product was available i didn t understand why i had to wait less than two months to get my order i was so disappointed by the amazon this time doing business like that i am not sure how long you will survive
1,the price was great it arrived quickly and it was exactly what i ordered great deal and great service
0,this would be a great rebounder if it were not so cheaply made one month after happily using it a spring broke then another it is one of the least expensive models out there and i guess there is a reason for that best to save your money and buy a more expensive model
0,maybe it was just me but this concert dvd is a major disappointment it s quite surprising to see how little if any connection madonna makes with the audience shorn of her locks her aerobically toned and fit body is the hard shell of an automaton here perhaps it s a result of her having become larger than life ala striesand whitney houston etc despite all the razzle dazzle here examples of an almost icy distance from her audience abound songs like vogue and express yourself should have been rousing stompers instead they are overstylized choreographed to the max and perfunctory the effect is like watching a canned tv award show performance worst of all is her ill conceived like a virgin i can understand the need to refashion the same songs to forestall boredom but virgin recast as s marlene dietrich nightclub lounge kitsch complete with unisex tuxedo top hat and faux german accent this is a shocking lapse in judgment and boring to boot the only sign of life comes near the end with the lock step performance of holiday which is seductively refashioned as a funky marching band romp here she and her dancers perform in what must have been stifling maxi length military style coats one look at this performance and you can t help but wish for the juice of her earlier stuff no one begrudges the right of an artist to change and grow but there is something to be said for giving the audience what it came for i m willing to give madonna one more shot and pick up the blond ambition dvd when or if it becomes available until then my best advice is to check out dvds featuring the likes of tina turner donna summer or even sade they all prove that you can make the old new again share and reveal something that a studio production can t and thus never need to worry about going stale real concert greatness is not overstylized pomp it s audience connection
0,with the million that was spent on the video game inspired film doom you d think that director andrzej bartkowiak would have used better lighting so that the audience could actually see what was going on more clearly on second thought given that this predictable film was little more than minutes of shoot the mutants it s pretty clear that mr bartkowiak may have kept the lights dim in a dismal attempt to avoid personal embarrassment as to the film s plot it can be summarized in a single sentence a group of soldiers lead by their sarge played by the rock travel to mars to stop a bunch of scientists that have inadvertently transformed themselves into flesh eating mutants after injecting a criminal with dna recovered from ancient humanoid fossils found in a martian archaeological dig so there s tons of shooting a lot of screams gallons of fake blood guts being tossed about a martian sewer and a teleportation device that looks like a small scale version of the sphere others who starred in this forgettable rubbish include karl urban soldier john grimm and rosamund pike as john grimm s sister named sam why these two actors would stoop so low as to participate in doom defies logic to anyone who actually paid good money to watch this star film in a theater you have my deepest sympathy to anyone thinking of purchasing a copy of doom on dvd please notice that there are a ton of used copies available for very a cheap price that alone should tell you how good this film is
0,this is one of those movies that you have to ask why remake a movie that did it right the first time buy the version and forget this one skip it
1,i got this as a gift on my baby shower was so happy to receive it this playpen is so wonderful very colorful sooo easy to set it up i m pretty sure our unborn child will be thrilled about it i received great reviews on this gear also so don t be dissapointed to grab one like it awesome playpen
0,watching this movie is about as much fun as having your wisdom teeth pulled boring and tacky even by horror standards the only fun comes from seeing the psychic kids future wicked stepfather being eaten by the monster that lives in his closet hence the title i ve seen far worse but those worse movies were more enjoyable than this the following morning you probably won t remember having seen it if only the monster had eaten this movie s negative then we would all be spared
1,my daughter months literally started running in place with excitement when she opened this baby doll which was a gift from my best friend i ve never seen her react like this to any gift my daughter has continued to bring this baby doll around with her everywhere usually she just ditches her toys and plays with the tupperware the doll has a soft squishy body that makes her cuddley despite the fact that she has as my husband is constantly saying a hard plastic head
0,full of ads hardly any content at all not worth paying for it
1,i have been reading the ny times book review for many many years there rarely is a week when there is not some review of considerable interest to me though i oppose its political bias which is left liberal i appreciate the solidity and respectful way in which most reviews are written there is a sense that for the times books and culture in general have meaning and importance the times tends to bet for its main articles on proven winners a review in the times can make a person s name and many many are the writers whose books have arrived in the times offices never to be given a real look at the times articles and reviews are not the longest and the deepest but they do often provide pleasant reads and arouse real interest in the book in question the ny times book review is still of first importance because the ny times is i still try to skim through every week searching for the review or two that i really have to try to chew and digest
0,this biscotti is just awful too sweet and too hard la tempesta is a real biscotti
0,hands down the worst episode of the masters of horror television show it s dull boring and not scary it will leave you scratching your head saying that s all don t even bother with this dvd it s a waste of your precious time
1,the dash of my black car is anthracite gray and it shows dust easily the california duster is created for either exteriors or interiors of cars and is impregnated with paraffin wax this picks up the dust and the soft fibers float over the uneven surfaces of the car interior picking it all up in one swipe i keep this in the car and once a week i swipe down the interior all over to keep the car sparkling clean it s small enough to keep handy under the seat this makes a really nice gift for someone to congratulate them on their new car or for someone who likes doing their own detailing
1,i love to cook i am not a professional by all means but i do enjoy the concept of preparing food other than tv bon appetit is one of my main sources i refer to that inspires me to create my next meal i have been an on and off again subscriber to the magazine for several years now i have to admit i don t necessary use the recipes in the magazine but they and the ingredients that i read definitely leads me to come up with my own ideas some of my favorite issues includes the topics of barbecue i love some of the ribs recipes they have printed over the years and thanksgiving what i am not so wild about is that a lot of the recipes over the years have become so high end from my point of view a lot of these meals are not every day meals you would make i am blessed to live in a big city where i can find most of the ingredients but if i lived in a smaller city or town it probably would be difficult to find these recipes are not geared for single people or families who have mouths to feed all in all i still enjoy reading bon appetit and being inspired by the magazine
0,both versions of scansoft cause my installer to have problems mainly it tries to re install softscan every time i start up softscan also it has started to try and reinstall softscan if i try to right click on a jpg there is very little to no chance of getting any help from scansoft nuance to debug this problem save your money and buy some thing else

1,upgrading to the from a old canon megapixel waited a few months to purchase when i heard the was being updated with the panasonic has fixed the main complaints about the which were no build in lens cover noisy images at higher iso speeds imo the build in lens cover alone is wirth the price permium over the as others have said this camera has a great build quality easy operation and a high quality look i ordered the black model and was pleasantly surprised when i opened the box it has the look of a retro cartridge camera which is cool the chrome or polished stainless steel cant tell is first rate and looks great with the matte black case the lcd is huge and bright the camera s simple mode does a great job the the other modes are fully customizable the zoom is fantastic but you need a really steady hand at full zoom even with optical stabilization turned on i did take some surprisingly sharp shots zoomed way in from my car as i came across a herd of deer shot to shot speed is really great unless you are using the flash the red eye reduction works better than any other digital camera i have used overall i am extremely pleased if you are looking for a great zoom camera in a small form factor you should seriously consider the dmc

1,this is my first asian food purchase with pier mall and my first review here at amazon as well these matcha candies get better and better with each one i can see how they could become quite addictive individually wrapped and matcha powder coated this flavor takes some getting used the outside is kind of hard underneath the powder and then the inside is all chewy and decadent yummy actually i think i m already addicted also nice to travel with or put in your bag these won t melt or make a mess
1,there were a few minor imperfections but i m overall happy with this sword the attention to detail and replication of cloud s weapon are commendable
1,it s hysterical and pitiful that some of the other reviewers describe this program as though it is some subversive dangerous dogmatic propaganda warning this program teaches children to love themselves and respect others and we all know how threatening and subversive those values are quick run back to the cave and hide the sky is falling if you believe little boys playing with dolls is sick and threatens their development then you won t like this program if you think it s subservise propaganda to tell little girls it s okay for them to be smart and strong then you won t like this program either on the other hand if you are a nurturing parent and some of your goals include teaching your child to have a sense of self to respect humanity s differences gasp and to empower double gasp them to reach for the stars then you ll enjoy sharing this program with your kids

1,i can not find anything negative to say about this camera i wanted a small pocket sized camera a tried brands such as casio s exislim even though this camera is not as small as the casio it is far superior of a camera size why s it is still small enough to fit in a pocket but is also big enough so that it isn t awkward or difficult to use the pictures from this camera turn out spectacular the zoom is by far the best feauture of this camera the lcd screen is also very clear unlike the casio and other camera s similar to this one you can t go wrong with this camera highly recommended
0,this product is overpriced i found oz bags of this at the local grocery store for which is cents oz this gives for the oz bag featured here and there ordinarily would be a further discount for buying it in a larger size bag the candy is good but it seems better to look for it in your local store

1,i just got my first case of this fabric softener last week and yesterday i was walking downstairs when the smell of lavender hit me i was surprised because i hadn t sprayed any lavender freshener in the air when i realized that my boyfriend was doing a load of laundry like seventh generation s lavender laundry detergent i love this product if you use them in tandem not only do your clothes smell like real lavender not the chemically based smells of mainstream products but they come out clean and soft i especially like the lavender smell for my sheets and blankets and it s gentle enough to use on my baby s clothes too i love that it s made with natural products and real lavender essential oil it s also safe for my septic system so i m sold on this product if you re sensitive to the chemical based scents of the mainstream fabric softeners or can t find one that smells good to you try this one

1,i wouldn t call this a rocker seat the kick stand on it makes it look like a rocker if you put the stand down the legs almost touch the floor you can make it move a little if you have wood floors but not enough to call it a rocker if you have a very mellow baby this chair is perfect my baby likes to sit and stare at the toys but if you need any type of movement for your baby to stay calm i wouldn t recommend this chair the music sounds on it is very nice not annoying at all i don t use the vibration on it yet until my baby can itch his cheeks if needed the only reason i say stars and not is because it is falsely advertised as a rocker other than that it is very cute and my baby enjoys it alot

0,dr hawkins first book power vs force was interesting and presented a useful way to dowse using kinesiology however he began to venture into misapplication of this method and has now gone off on a tangent where he seems to wish to delude himself into thinking he has developed a fool proof way to judge the level of consciousness of any entity concept or construct and the truth or falsehood of any statement there are serious logical philosophical and practical flaws in his work and his attempt to quantify matters that aren t quantifiable leads to meaningless data that probably matches the bias beliefs of those carrying out the muscle tests this book is a good example to present to show how people can deceive themselves and misuse muscle testing and dowsing techniques the actual technique is worthwhile but much of what hawkins presents in the book is utterly meaningless and invalid the levels of awareness that can be tapped into with dowsing are wise enough to not let us ask just anything we wish to and be able to receive accurate valid answers hawkins explores issues about media politics religion spirituality history philosophies healing arts entertainment and more and reveals his own gross ignorance on many matters he seems unaware that many of the people he trusts in politics and media are professional gangsters liars and two faced sociopaths he has a negative view of conspiracy theorists many of whom are genuinely determined to find the truth and don t resort to hawkins misguided shortcut attempt to identify truth hawkins also fosters confusion with his description of his muscle test method as it really has little to do with applied kinesiology but is a form of dowsing where the muscle is directed to remain weak or strong in lieu of muscle response moving a pendulum or rod i hope hawkins gets to reconsider his current efforts consciousness and spiritual research are vital endeavors and there are others doing useful responsible work in those areas for now i d encourage hawkins to recognize that was in part an inside job many conservative politicians and pundits are corrupt frauds and the overall maturity of consciousness in america is not greater than the rest of the world
1,great seller to deal with and the product is the best on the market
1,set up was easy just read the manual and follow the instructions don t take short cuts forcasting is excellent after setting the barometer to match local conditions we live over feet above sea level adjusting for that was needed weather com s zip code oriented barometric pressure info made that relatively easy the screen is easy to read and understand the main unit has a solid feel and does not look cheap the external humidity and temperature sensor fits easily between a closed window and it s screen the manual could be more complete it wasn t clear that the icon that depicts a connection with the national time service doesn t appear until after the first connection is made in the wee hours of the morning when you manually set the clock make sure you do it in hour mode then switch to hour mode if that is what you want displayed again the manual should have pointed that out
0,i bought this barbie after seeing two pictures of angel barbies on the website and reading the manufacturer s description one picture seems to have been deleted now the manufacturer s description is of an angel with a dark blue dress and a long gold sash i trusted that the manufacturer s description which matched one of the pictures was the correct angel the doll with the light blue dress is not impressive at all it is very simple with vinyl wings be aware of which you are purchasing the description is deceptive and incorrect
0,the batmobile itself is nice and stylish for a boy who adores batman but this same boy gets extremely frustrated trying to shoot the coin shaped projectile that it comes with you have to insert it just so to get it to shoot when you press the button and my son doesn t always do it then i have to get a butter knife and pry it out so i can put it in for him for dollars it s worth it so long as your child doesn t absolutely want a shooting batmobile ps my sister bought the same one for her son this christmas and is having the same problem so i do not think it is unique to mine
1,i purchased this lens back in march of to shoot static warhammer models with my i found that longer lenses such as the sigma the canon ef and the tamron sp autofocus all were too long with the s focal crop and would result in requiring me to use a lot more physical space that what i had room for to get the shot the canon ef f is nearly a perfect match with the for this purpose its small its compact and its short focal length do not require that i be standing three feet away from the model i m shooting as far as shooting at non static objects such as insects the lens is slow to focus and loud in both noise and vibration which results in startled subjects and missed shots the same also applies for non macro shots as well its slow focus makes it a poor choice for action photography and its loud enough to draw attention to you when you are attempting other shots as well

1,one reviewer writes that these are oreo crackers without the creme and they are right these thin oreo crisp wafer type cookies by nabisco are easy to pack for when you re on the run and just need a quick sugar infusion they also make for snacking anytime of the day or night and they give you that great oreo taste without actually using creme as an ingredient these crackers are cholesterol free and trans fat free hooray there are only calories in a serving and a serving contains only two grams of fat they are baked crackers which helps make them healthier than other snacking choices including greasy french fries these crackers somehow manage to give you the full oreo taste experience while omitting the creme and a fair amount of the calories too excellent these oreo thin crisps come in six smaller packets which will be inside the box you buy this makes them even more portable for both children and adults another advantage of the cookies coming in smaller packages inside the box is that you know that each packet has been pre measured to contain only calories this way you can t accidentally eat too many and take in more calories than you wanted to have i notice that these crackers are made with cocoa please consult your doctor if you have any concerns about caffeine chocolate and cocoa could contain too much caffeine for you if you are sensitive to that i recommend these crackers for persons on the go who want a quick snack they should provide you with a sugar boost for quick energy they make for a healthier alternative to other snack foods loaded with fat and or cholesterol buy some and enjoy them today smiles

0,it s unfortunate that with a name like canon you expect a quality camera that s why you shell out the money for an item that you think canon will stand behind unfortunately this is not the case i bought this camera to use in graduate school industrial design i needed it to do research for my thesis i figured between that all the product photographs and the need good portfolio pieces spending the on an camera would be well worth the investment i was wrong about a month after i bought the camera it started to malfunction the lens got stuck and would not come out neither would it go all the way back in so the lens cover would not close not only putting the lens in danger but draining the battery as well it was still under warranty so i sent it to the canon service center in elk grove village illinois it was received and i was informed that my camera would be returned in business days that was almost a month and a half ago i have put my thesis research on hold because i do not have the proper camera for it every time i call the service center i am told that the parts are on back order evidently they don t know when these shipments are due in their center so they don t know when i will have my camera back the best part is when i called two weeks ago they offered me a brand new the told me it was a great deal and that i should accept the offer because they never do that meaning they never offer a new camera for one in repair i pointed out that the was only had a smaller screen and cost nearly less than my camera i also reminded her that my camera was brand new when it broke and i had to send it in today i was told that there was no information on my camera the backordered parts or when they could send my camera back the woman on the phone asked me why i didn t accept the that was offered and when i explained and asked for a camera the same model as mine she said they were not authorized to do that i told her that i was going to spend the time originally set aside for my thesis research to write letters to both the service center and canon corporate headquarters and she suddenly had a technician she could consult and my camera would be back to me by the end of the week i won t hold my breath but a copy of this review will be sent to canon

1,i was very excited to get my hands on this book i have been ordering this series from amazon co as they are released as i can get them several months ahead on their american counter parts i must say that i was disappointed with the beginning of the book first hem is not the character that i wanted to read about second the start is slow and the plot drags a little but all is forgiven after pages i warmed up to hem i actually think that the authors writting style has improved each book and this book just feels right i was done reading way before i wanted to be done the ending is nothing but action i put the book down entertained and wanting more what else can you ask for in a work of fictio
1,i loved their wagashi not easy to find in the midwest this was a great purchase ordered on monday arrived on thursday still cold would definitely order again
1,because it felt like it predicted that i d be listening to the cd someday i m referring to the line the kids of ad will draw from the music much the same sense of well being and warmth that we do today now i admit that i was in so i guess i technically missed the literal kid description by a year but the more general prediction of the inter generational timeless appeal of the beatles was right on i didn t see them on the ed sullivan show i was born almost twelve years after they broke up and about a year after the tragic shooting of john lennon but i like many many other people born too late to have experienced beatlemania as it was occuring have since become a huge fan of all their work this album has my favorite of all the beatle s songs i ll follow the sun that song alone is worth the five stars but thankfully the rest of the album is great too this album gets a little bit too much grief and it may not be quite as amazing as something like abbey road but it s still better than just about anything else out there

0,isn t it frustrating when a book spends a lot of time building up the problem to which you say yeah yeah that s me and then gives you no answer or a weak one to which you say no duh i m afraid this book is one of them the title is misleading because you assume he will help you find the life you ve only dreamed of or at least point you in the right direction to get started but i was left depressed after reading it because it basically says that god gives us desires that we can t have on earth so that we will long for him and heaven i don t believe that s the abundant life jesus promised so i went to the bible i should have gone there first i looked up every time it talks about desires and got my answer delight yourself in the lord and he will give you the desires of your heart ps so i set out to seek him i started reading knowing god by j i packer and began to get answers to all my questions about desire i hope you ll find them too in him
0,in our pursuit for ultimate baby items the infant carseat topped our list what s more important than the safety of your first child especially in so unpredicatable a situation as driving our search led us to this graco carseat and we added it to our wish list and recieved it as a christmas gift just before our daughter s birth in january the seat is fairly attractive but its good points stop there it s a bear to install not because it s complicated but rather because you need an extraordinarily strong man or a woman unlike myself certainly to install the base we ended up taking it to an inspector who spent about minutes tugging on the belts with all his might and then huffed and puffed and told us that should be in there real good now we examined it and asked why the seat was still able to flip up toward the back of the car and he replied oh they all do that that s normal unsure but with the safety rating to back it we continued to use it throughout her first months it was a cumbersome piece of equipment lots of bumping and banging it about to get it into the car with the baby already in the seat we have door sedans a subaru legacy an something oldsmobile and my mom s saturn ion with the seat already in the car it s a struggle to get the baby in without bumping her head or catching her legs on the sides at least once for me my husband simply can t put her in with the carseat already in the car not to mention that the seat while installed in the car has never felt especially stable with the exception of my mom s ion which has the latch system of course the drawback of the ion is that my husband can barely fit into the front seat because the carseat is so large and cumbersome that he cannot move his seat back and so he is sort of smashed into the dashboard then in the past week the seat has begun to fall over while we re driving literally go around a curve look back and her seat s at a degree angle from the backseat of the car my daughter is months old still falls a bit below the weight and height limits for the seat we ve checked the belts that secure the seat pulled with all our might and the seat continues to malfuction this is a safety issue if i ve ever seen one with enough force she could end up directly on her side say the force of a side impact in an accident upon closer inspection i shouldn t be altogether shocked the base of the seat is proportionately much smaller than the top where baby sits sort of like a wine glass i suppose so it s top heavy and likely the heavier the load on top the greater the likelihood it will topple at the slightest provocation needless to say we ll begin shopping for a new seat immediately as for the snugride i would recommend parents think twice before purchasing it i d certainly never consider it for an older vehicle without the latch system and i d still take it for a trial run in a newer one that does have the latch system in hindsight i wish i had shopped around a bit more
0,i was very disappointed with how tiny this eternity cross is i don t know if the measurements were in the description for it or not or if they were and i just didn t see or pay attention to them but this cross is so tiny it really seems like it s meant for a very young child the necklace may be but the pendant itself was so small not at all what i was looking for so i m going to give this as a gift for a niece what i was really wanting was a larger heavier duty sterling silver eternity cross as a slide for an omega chain for an adult never have found one yet

0,not only are probe covers unavailable in retail locations or over internet it seems that first years has discontinued the product at least the product is not listed or mentioned on their website we searched for model the number imprinted on the bottom of the thermometer apparently they don t see any value in telling customers the product was discontinued furthermore the site is full of broken image links the thermometer works well but without probe covers it s not a good investment you can find equivalent products with readily available probe covers if the store you re buying the thermometer at doesn t have covers there find another product with covers available

1,sadly as a rule i have no great interest in history but ms behrman s approach brings the person of thomas jefferson to life in a way that appeals to all ages she puts personality and emotion into her writing which makes potentially dull facts dates and events brim with energy this is a wonderful series and she does it justice in every way
0,i m not sure why this magazine is so highly rated sure it s an o k magazine if you like immersing yourself in hype marketing speak and incredibly superficial language admittedly the pictures are pretty and as an obsessed mountain biker i can say we like bike porn i just cannot read any of the articles chock full of over the top adjectives and xtreme language i don t trust a magazine that calls every new incremental advancement in biking technology revolutionary or amazing or any number of disgustingly inappropriate modifiers they ceaselessly use vapid technical jargon made up to sound high minded and high tech but is nothing more than marketing spew the tech advice column is full of suspicious letters that have the stench of stealth advertising if there s one thing that s well thought out about this magazine it s how best to bombard the reader with sales pitches half truths and hype in short this magazine is blatant industry propaganda my first advice don t buy it if you do buy it for the love of god don t take anything between those covers seriously
1,as my class of middle school students and i enjoyed the comments for tuscan whole milk one thought kept popping into our heads why not skim why heap such praise upon whole milk and neglect skim whose delightfully low fat content has made my morning ecstatic for years i believe tuscan skim milk will allow me to live forever though i haven t proved that one yet my students say it enables them to do difficult homework with ease so at last we can breathe a full sigh of relief that amazon is providing the world with the joy of skim

0,this is my first public review of any product i generally dont have the time or motivation to go throught the process of posting a review however i have never had such a negative experience with a commercially available software package before from beginning to end the process of repeated attempts to install and then trying to remove was time consuming frustrating and crippled my computer first the operating environment details i m running xp pro on a pentium with of ram upon the de installation of the existing nis and spyware doctor applications i proceeded with the installation of nis the installation appeared to go cleanly but upon attempting to restart my computer hung on shutting down and upon attempting to come up i got a blank desktop with no task bar start menu or desktop icons later as i was working with symantec support and was able to get a desktop back i also experienced things as not being able to bring up the control panel or click on the my computer icon of course i had no internet access during the whole ordeal since i couldnt find any phone number contact in the ridiculously minimal instruction manual that came with the package i called my local isp to find out what they knew about the affects of using nis through them i got a phone number for symantec support as a side note the manual points out ways to get support if you have access to the internet and email but gives no direction if you dont have access to those over the course of the next days of working through my issues with nis my experience with symantec support left me with the impression that they were mostly incompetent and quite innefective i give symantec credit for having phone support and i did work with one knowledgable support person there named jay but most of the experience was frustrating and time consuming the help desk is located in india and the first problem is that they couldnt hear me though i was speaking loudly the next problem is that i had to answer the same questions repeatedly as if the person didnt understand my answers on a number of ocassions i felt the person on the other end was just going through a script and wasnt listening to what i was saying or reading my growing case notes i got passed around a lot to different people and spent a lot of time on hold they kept trying to get me off the phone even though we hadnt worked through the problem completely in one instance the helpdesk person was trying to tell me that things were all fixed even when i had told her there was an activation error during the re install we were working on having worked with tech support and edited registries and tinkered with start up configurations and various services settings i could never get nis to install tried four times trying to un install the package turned out to be almost as difficult and troublesome uninstalling has left me with problems with my computer i have yet to work out i still cant use my scanner because it complains about a symantec dll issue i have no idea why that would be anyway i would rate this product less than zero if i could there was nothing that went right and a lot that went wrong i cant believe symantec could put out such a pathetic piece of software with such inffective support i m returning nis and trying my luck with zone alarm

1,the watch is an excellent timekeeper automatic calibration really works although some reviews i d read indicate otherwise i like the dial features changes to dst calendar knows how many days in a month etc do not though travel with this watch for a while without the instruction book the four control buttons take some time to figure out and most of them are so rarely used that when you do need the stopwatch or one of the various other options you ll likely need the book at least i did also understand that this is a big watch probably at least twice as thick as the watch you re used to and considerably heavier it will hang up on a jacket or anything with long sleeves the g shock though is tougher than a hammer and if you don t mind the bulk i d recommend it rlm in iow

1,i bought this camera to take pictures of my family and friends i have had if for more than one year and it has performed above expectations under all conditions the minute video feature is great and was an unexpected bonus since i didn t know about it when i bought it off amazon the camera works great with iphoto and macos x i bought a mb card for it and so far it has been great both my father and my father in law have the previous powershot and they have had no problems with it i figure at some point i ll have to change the battery because lithium ions lose capacity per year but so far it has worked flawlessly

1,after slogging through a number of these reviews it is clear that most cannot see that we twenty first century americans were not the intended audience for this movie the movie was intended to be a unifying morale builder for the national socialist party in germany which had been in power only about a year when this movie was made from its loss of world war i until the nsdap was elected to power in germany in the people had suffered every kind of internecine mob warfare illegal abuse and theft of whole portions of germany at the hands of the french and an economic catastrophe that made our american depression look like a picnic by comparison this movie sought to persuade germans germans that this dreadful misery was finally over and that the criminal bolshevik traitors responsible for germany s defeat in world war i and all the residual woes would be defeated once and for all it must have been a most welcome message because as you watch the film you certainly don t get the impression that anyone had to beg the many thousands of germans who attended the nsdap rallies to stand up and cheer their hearts out if you speak and understand german you ll have a much greater likelihood of being able to understand the impact of these rallies and this film that celebrates them for many who are not conversant in the german language or who know little about the actual history of the time besides what they were exposed to in american world war ii films the film is actually pretty boring after a while you sit there and watch one group of soldiers police or workers after another marching and marching and marching this is interspersed with speeches by hitler and the other party officals from time to time you ll see interesting looking people doing everyday things some in costume but mostly they re just talking walking eating brushing their teeth and so on be advised for those of you who expect the whole thing to be a stirring gigantic ss parade with weapons bristling be prepared to be disappointed the last group of soldiers on parade are indeed the ss leibstandarte adolph hitler and they re marching to what was reputedly hitler s favorite piece der badenweiler remember to notice that they aren t even carrying rifles or bayonets lastly in my opinon the commentary by historian dr anthony santoro is mostly just another sarcastic demeaning rant against the people in the film so typical of those who pronounce judgement on the vanquished after every war the marching soliders and other germans who reverberated such thrills of hope for their poor beleagured country are all long dead but santoro must make fun of them for the amusement of the american audience try to remember this movie was not made for you
1,the working notes of this book are utterly staggering in their implication to ontology what is being merleau answers in the manner of lao tse and alludes to something like a divine feminine at the heart of wild perception it was said by sartre in his autobiography situations that after merleau s mother died who was like a goddess to him merleau returned began the project anew what is intimated in the working notes is invaluable to the true student of philosophy and life and in the end merleau returns to the very object of his study you can really feel this descent at the book nears its end it is however an ascent of the entirety of the history of philosophy to a new level of comprehension that i assure you
1,i bought two of these as a gift for my husband he d previously bought himself one of those eletronic tie racks and the thing fell apart while he was trying to get it installed these were ready to go right out of the box no assembly required took up less space in his closet than the hangers with ties wrapped around them that he had and have made his tie collection managable and easy to select from the cushioned tie hooks ensure the ties will not slip off and also that they will not be damaged a breeze to organize his vast tie collection and he s loving this product
1,i purchase this on amazon for no tax free shipping you can not match this quality at this price the hd with hdmi cable using comcast digital box is outstanding the sound is also better with the hdmi vs componet cables the jacks are hard to connect in the back of the set and you need to set the picture to manuel mode the picture is to red on the preset modes and looks like there is too much color i looked at samsung for and i am glad i saved myself with this lcd
1,i have tried many brands of chocolate covered toffee and i have to say virgina diner english chocolate covered toffee is one of the best it is very fresh and it melts in your mouth
0,i thought the art had a certain charm and used strictly as a picture book for children who can t yet read i think it s quite nice too bad you can t make up your own story to go with it the moment the child starts to read though better hide it quick because unfortunately the book reads like a condensed communist manifesto for kids as others have noted or a socialist agenda primer i don t know for sure that s what marcus pfister had as an aim and i m not going to speculate on his politics he has three kids and may raise them as he likes and indulge in any such philosophical musings as float his boat yes i suppose sharing is nice certainly sharing one s talents and abilities for the betterment of others is a great thing but in america we get paid for that charity is voluntary not coerced furthermore stripping yourself of what makes you unique and interesting not necessarily better just unique and interesting or giving away all your possessions is a lousy way to make and keep friends isn t it is this book implying that somehow friendship can only be obtained by placating envy a negative personal quality that should be dealt with by self examination and intent to change not pandering is it saying that being interesting and having unique qualities is bad almost seems like it at least to me furthermore there s an overtone of only by belonging to a group can you have self worth which is as hoary a case of balderdash as ever i ve seen of course people who agree with that egregious sentiment will disagree with me but that won t make them right the two stars if you must know are for the art
1,this was bought as a gift for my dad who has limited mobility it s easy for him to use easy to handle and gives him a great shave he really likes it
0,i got mine today and it is being returned today i had high hopes given the reviews so far and the supposed improvement in low light sensitivity i was hoping for an all in one device for stills and video here s my results stills pictures are not too bad but do not compare with a similar canon which i own the zoom works well focusing is ok but slow the pictures themselves have quite a bit of noticeable noise in them flash or not like they are all taken at a high iso setting on a regular digital cam so slight disappointment here video if this is improved low light sensitivity i would not have liked to see the results on the video does not even come close to comparing to my regular sony dv camera focusing is hit or miss and shake is much more evident at high zoom than with my sony i really was hoping for the be all end all combo device but the does neither very well ergonomically it is beautiful and fits in one hand very well the finish is great and the buttons are well placed but it doesn t justify the price or quality misses on the photos and video themselves

1,upgraded to this razor after my old remington died and i ve been very happy with it it cut a bit close which irritated my skin at first but i think that was just me getting used to the lift cut this would be an excellent razor if it wasn t for two features or lack thereof that make it a pain to use the internal battery is nicd this type of battery has memory to it which means for optimal performance the battery should be fully drained before you recharge it otherwise the life of the battery will slowly shorten until the battery is useless there isn t a low battery indicator by itself either of these features wouldn t pose a problem combined you re left wondering when you ll have to charge the shaver or when you re off on that business trip if you ll need to bring the charger in the long run this razor is cheap enough and i expect the battery to last for years still it would have been better if the battery was made of nimh or some technology that s not years old

0,i have gone through all the major revisions of paperport and i dislike them all the features have improved but the program has become steadily more unreliable and bug prone it often crashes which means i have to shut down the entire program when editing a document and restart which apart from taking ages loses all the changes i made very frustrating it has also become steadily slower as the version numbers have climbed you just to sit around twiddling your thumbs waiting for it to load a document or advance a page on a scanned document especially if it contains many pages if you can find an alternative don t buy it unfortunately for me i can s see any alternative if you want to manage scanned pdf files in a sophisticated way incidentally this product seems living proof of the dangers of bloatware it s pretty clear that the programmers have lost control of the software s innnards plus by the way support for this product is a scandal for each email sent unbelievable

0,great fan of the man they call sugar zucchero but this outing is really below par this cd consists of rerecordings of older songs with the addition of other famous singers did he send the original recordings to these people en did they ad little pieces here and there it sounds like it none of the songs have gotten better compared to the originals to me this cd is a total rip off intended to make easy money and get more attention for sugar outside of italy don t buy it get oro shake or blue sugar instead

1,these days classic game shows aren t really as popular as reality shows like survivor and american idol however with the surprise summer show game show marathon in cbs many clssics had the opportunity to breathe a glimpse of new life like press your luck match game and card sharks another classic which was revised let s make a deal with monty hall s benchmark into pop culture revisted many have wondered whether the classic game of trading will ever come back onto television again thankfully those who easily own dvd actually don t have to wait for the show to return they can just trade in the comforts of their own living room the let s make a deal dvd game recaptures the classic trading that monty hall made popular from the s and s into a great fun game in this game monty hall puts traders to the test where you can trade your chances for big nostalgic prizes like classic cars from datsun and cadillac to trips and fur coats from dicker dicker of beverly hills on top of that there are classic quick deals to play for extra cash for example if you have a pair of scissors monty will give you also there are the classic booby prizes zonks although they are fun to receive you get absolutely nothing to show for it there is also the anticipation of getting the big deal for big bucks unlike dvd editions of shows like family feud and the price is right the game really delivers a great job from monty and each of the great concepts from the classic game show the mastering really thrives with classic clips of carol merill and deal s announcer jay stewart on each of the prizes although i just wish there could ve been more games to play i am absolutely impressed with the way let s make a deal was put into a dvd game if you haven t seen this classic game show monty hall hosted you have to buy this great game i absolutely recommend this and that is definitely not a zonk price b dvd mastering a fun enjoyment b overall b

1,so you re looking for an nba game but don t know which one to get i shall sort through the good and bad offered in both nba live and nba between the two i have played live and i can honestly say nba was a better buy for me at i ve had countless hours of some of the most joyous moments and some of the most frustrating however nba is more of an all around basketball game if you re good at offense and poor on defense chances are good that you won t win as many games as you might think but if you re only good at defense and horrible at offense you won t win much then either you basically have to play an even game altogether this is based on all star level for fans of offensive minded games look no further than nba live the basic controls are straight forward and easy to get a hang of so there won t be any real problems for newcomers to the series such as myself the best aspect featured in live is undoubtedly the freestyle superstars my favorite team is the and to see allen iverson pulling off the moves he does in real life on a game is nothing short of a rush another highlight is that when you re left wide open for a shot chances are extremely good that you ll drain it whereas on you still basically had to have a perfect release as for the overall look of each game i d say that nba steals that as well when you re looking at allen iverson or any other player for that matter there s no question who you re looking at he s got his tattoos his cornrows mustache everything nba live on the other hand almost tends to look childish at times don t get me wrong the graphics and dunks are awesome to look at but as you re dribbling upcourt i can t help but think the player s arms are too long of course that could just be me also seems to have more realistic courts i could do without the shots of the fans though nba pros fantastic gameplay the more you play the more you learn making it a game you can invest time in the graphics are great when you turn up the difficulty it actually gets harder nba cons offseason on legacy mode is kind of lame too frustrating at times when the other team is on a run it s nearly impossible to hit anything other than a lay up loading time is almost ridiculous nba live pros easy for anyone to pick up and play freestyle superstars commentary is a lot better than dunks are fairly easy to execute and make for some excellent highlights nba live cons camera angle is horrible far too offensive minded almost too easy at times fouls are called too liberally on you so there you have it a fairly unbiased view on each game if live were to drop down to i d highly recommend it because in reality it really is fun to play but at i m not sure if it s worth every penny plus has a great street ball mode in addition to the legacy mode so did live ever really have a chance
1,i am trying the perricone promise diet i received this item in a timely manner and well packaged

1,i bought this gun and days after the dang stock broke other than that it was ok good acuricy the clip holds in the amunition holder and shots in the magazine also the lazers sight does not work
0,i must agree witht he reviewer who commented about the book being written by committee the narrative is choppy and lacking not only key details but also historical background because it s an autobiography i don t necessarily think that it s fair to damn the book for being self centered it is about him i do feel however that the book needs better editing and a bit more self examination it s an okay addition to one s list of books about everest expeditions which i must admit i ve developed a morbid fascination with after recently re reading into thin air i wouldn t however use it as my primary source for information or impressions
0,i was really looking foward to watching this one as i have seen the box and looked at the reviews here so i was upset when i watched this sad movie gary graham t v s alien nation is a robot jox which means he pilots a large voltron like machine which are used as fighting weapons in a future where war is no longer fought the f x are not very good and the story is paper thin only the acting is good but it can t save this one from being just a let down skip it
1,in the never ending race for larger and larger megapixel counts the has fallen behind the pack however if that s the only measure by which you re judging a digital camera you really should consider further research before plunking down several hundred dollars nevertheless it s quite a good camera what i like about it most it looks and feels solid some of the reviewers that pan this camera for feeling flimsy and plasticky are apparently still stuck in the realm of pro cameras that cost several thousand dollars it s not a bulletproof titanium box that you can back a hummer over but it certainly seems to outdo dslrs in it s category very good battery life backwards compatibility with decade s worth of nikon slr lenses my gripes the latch that keeps the pop up flash in place broke in less than a week inability to meter through older manual focus lenses lack of full functionality with flashes other than the sb and sb nikon s raw software and control software aren t included with the camera and are imho overpriced and on top of that nikon has split what used to be one overpriced software package into two overpriced software packages what would improve this camera the most iso and iso ability to store multiple custom white balance presets and then pull them up on the fly replacing the idiot modes i e portrait landscape etc with modes that you could customize
1,my kid was upset when i got him an improvised harry potter broom for christmas o k it wasn t an officially licensed product but since magic brooms are imaginary anyway any stick with a bunch of straw at one end is as good as any other but no apparently a corn lobby broom wasn t good enough for him anyway he wouldn t talk to me for a month which was good at first but then got really annoying for my kid s birthday i decided to get him something really special so i got him this bag of xanthan gum i even wrapped it up real nice with wrapping paper and ribbon my kid opened his present and couldn t figure out what it was it s xanthan gum i told him it s gum from outer space from the planet xanthan my kid was busy staring at the label no it s not he slowly replied and then he began to read xanthan is made from the outer layer of a tiny inactive bacterium called xanthomonas campestris from the planet xanthan i interrupted since when did my kid learn to read i grabbed the bag and opened it here i stuck a spoon into the white powder try some it s really good my kid picked up the spoon and smelled the white powder go on i said you ll really like it he hesitated and then stuck his tongue into the powder i was starting to get impatient so i grabbed the spoon from him give it to me you big chicken and then i swallowed the powder the stuff dissolved into a thick slimy paste in my mouth but i smiled as i chewed it mmmmm this is the tastiest xanthan gum in the whole universe my kid looked at me as if i were lying if you like it so much then you can have it he said fine i replied it s too good for you anyway i figured a little reverse psychology would do the trick my kid s expression didn t change can i go now he asked yeah fine get out here i said now i m stuck with half a pound of xanthan gum and i don t know anyone with wheat allergies or celiac disease i can give this stuff to stupid kid

1,compass worked wonderfully for my trip around new england this summer only reason i don t give it stars is for want of a backlight for night driving remember to moisten the suction cups before adhering to the window i forgot the first time and it popped off minutes later never came off again the whole trip after i moistened them worth the money
1,everyone loved me in these glasses for our old fashioned banquet they completed my outfit great price and a speedy delivery which i really needed
0,conceptually this is a great game especially for a child with visions of being a vet you can theoretically learn about animals their care and health issues those stars for overall are basically for the concept and little else unfortunately the general usability of this game vis à vis lousy controls is quite low it s nearly impossible to move the character at times which results in stressful failure in the game it crashes it can t remember simple settings like leave the terribly loud and obnoxious music off playing this multiple times with my year old always goes from excitement to frustration bordering on tears more than once as a bunny gets woefully ill while your character is comically stuck bouncing between the sofa and ottoman once going you can engage your child by studying the books you ve bought also as you analyze the patients you learn about ailments as well as the treatments that is all good stuff but on whole the game is too frustrating to enjoy one final note this is the first time i ve ever bothered to review any product
0,t may be expresso grind but if you are expecting lovely dark aromatic coffee for your espresso maker think again bitter when drunk on own marginally better when combined with milk in cappuchino i shoulda known betta

0,i like japanese films and really wanted to like this one however i must say there are a lot of confusing parts to the plot now i have read this is going to be part of a trilogy one day if that is true i might give it a higher rating as of now however there are just a lot of things that don t make sense
1,last year i bought the gray female version of the art s buck artist s model and i was very very happy with it it was an enormous improvement on the old wooden models i grew up with it is detailed in a way that the old wooden mannequins never were and it is flexible enough to put into an accurate full lotus position complete with the detail of having the backs of the feet resting on the thighs and that is scary bendy the only problem with it is that the neck joint although providing a good range of motion is very delicate and broke not long after i bought it now this is not the end of the world if you have the right tools i used a dremel moto tool to cut out the remnant of the original joint and to grind the head off of a narrow nail which i then heated holding it with a pair of pliers and inserted into the upper torso to make a hole and then into the bottom of the neck problem solved the end result is still just as flexible as when it came out of the box with the exception of the neck s motion being limited to rotation from side to side apparently this flaw is known to sideshow toys who released a new second version of the model in two sexes and three colors the new series has a caucasian female figure that is not quite as flexible as the original among other things the detailed full lotus is pretty much out of the question and it is more voluptous having larger breasts a heavier body broader thighs and a much stronger neck also both mannequins have heads that seem just slightly out of proportion with the body just slightly larger than they should be be all that as it may the original gray pictured in the above listing and offered at a ten percent discount under list is the real thing skinnier and far more flexible than the current model but having a flaw which makes it something of a compromise making you choose between the genuinely superior flexibility of the original mannequin which you may eventually have to repair or seeking out the newer model which exchanges flexibility for sturdiness while adding features that can be summed up by the term sex appeal i have both models and after performing the necessary repair i prefer the original gray and highly recommend it with the caveat that you must be very careful while handling it unless you are willing to and able to perform a fairly easy repair i could perform it and i did which is why i rate this item as highly as i do all in all you can call the original gray an excellent product with a small repairable flaw your mileage may vary
0,i purchased this product thinking that it will be better than the hand held models or the scale type models since it combines measurements from hands and feet for a more accurate measurement of body fat the scale part works normal but the body fat measurement is higher by compared to tanita scale or omron hbf hand held omron replaced the unit but the new one is also inaccurate now i m tying to get my money refunded but omron does not want to take the unit back
1,i ve been doing yoga for years i ve gone through a couple of regular sticky mats by now i don t like how they get stretchy after a couple of years so i decided to buy something more durable i love the texture of this mat it s very solid feeling with a good bit of stick and it doesn t move around at all it has just the right amount of cushion to it and i use it on a hard floor i also bought the lumi towel large size also by manduka to put on the mat since my hands and feet tend to sweat by the time i get to the middle of my routine and this can make any mat slippery i didn t have any trouble with the coating on the mat it wore off after a little bit and i used the towel until it did i also didn t agree with some of the other reviews saying it was too heavy it s a bit heavy but not too much to carry around all over i made a carry handle from a yoga strap looped over both ends of the rolled up mat and throw it over my shoulder
1,this shirt is very cute but you may want to order it in a larger size than what your child normally would wear my child normally wears a month i ordered the size and it s much tighter and shorter than her other tops

1,genuine leather with fur lining are about the warmest things you can possibly wear an excellent choice for extremely cold winter weather well worth the money spent
1,speaking as someone who has to watch her carb intake carefully i was not keen on trying yet another item that claimed to be low carb and good tasting so often the two do not go together especially when dealing with the traditional more carby foods such as pasta bread rice etc dreamfields is a happy exception this is not to say you can cook up a whole box and eat it all at once those who have to watch carb intake will still need to do some portion control but you can actually have a large scoop of delicious hot pasta alone or in your culinary creations and not blow your carb allowance and this is not some flimsy dissolving cardboard tasting pasta it cooks up hearty and substantial when you eat it it fills up that i am so hungry for carbs i could eat a ton of potatoes need satisfying delicious filling and easier on the insulin levels than regular pasta i love it
1,i bought a user zone alarm suite for far less than zone alarm offered for a single user upgrade it pays to shop around and amazon is often where it all winds up

0,this camera took some great pictures and i enjoyed it s size and functionality for several months i was sitting in a lawn chair at a barbecue last weekend when i was passing it to a friend who was also seated the camera fell about feet onto soft grass the end the lens assembly is shot according to my local camera store not economical to fix this was about the softest fall a camera could take and not work it was like landing on a pillow i will not buy hp cameras again
1,i think this is a pretty good earpiece granted i ve only used one other it was a flimsy little thing that came w my friend s nokia but this one far surpasses that one in sound quality and comfort where my friend s would fall out of my ear this one once i got it figured out never comes loose second listening to people on my friend s i would have to turn up the sound to hear the person well and then they sounded muffled and distorted but on my jabra i can actually turn down the volume on my phone and they sound crisp and clear moreso than when i m not using the earpiece finally when my friend calls me and uses her earpiece she sounds distant and muffled i ve had no complaints from the people i m talking to using the jabra and in fact my mom said it sounds better when i use the earboom than when i don t the ear gels are a bit hard to get used to they are oddly shaped as you can see in the picture and there are six of them total three of them for each ear lots of reviewers complained about the fit and comfort of the ear gels while others claim these are the most comfortable earpieces they ve used and that they fit perfectly i can honesly say i ve had both experiences when i first got this unit the earpiece kept falling out everytime that i would turn my head very frustrating i tried pushing it into my ear as hard as i could i tried holding it in place with my hand but that only seemed to defeat the purpose of having a hands free earpiece nothing seemed to work i was thinking of returning it i was thinking of throwing it into traffic on i and then one day somehow i came to the realization that you have to sort of twist it into your ear with the little poky out part stuck in the fold of your ear next to the ear canal not the fold on the top of your ear if you do that it ll just pop out again and then voila it stays put matter o fact it ll stay put so well that it ll be a little bit difficult even painful to get out again i can imagine that people with different ear sizes different patience levels and lower iqs might have different experiences than my own but all i can say is that once i had this little bugger figured out i was golden i love this thing and almost never talk on the phone without it admittedly it is a bit difficult to get into your ear i d say it takes upward of seconds to get in properly before you re good and practiced at it which may not sound like a lot but it s long enough to not recognize somebody s voice or hear the first sentence they say or whatever a very mild frustration but like all things good and pleasant it takes a little practice to get it just right and now i have it so that i can answer the phone slip the earboom in my ear and start a conversation without missing a beat in fact i find this earpiece to be so comfortable that i forget that it s in until i go to scratch my ear or something the other complaint that i saw on here was that it s not compatible with nokia phones in fact it even says right on the package that it s not compatible with nokia that s funny i have a nokia and it works just fine they make two other models of earboom one of which clearly would not have worked with my phone both of which claim to be nokia compatible and neither of those works with my phone confusing yes the problem is it doesn t work with all nokia phones while browsing at the store i noticed that the ones that claimed to be nokia compatible had a list of phones that it works with but it didn t include mine it included one that was numerically speaking very close to my model the which piqued my curiosity and so i went to the friendly manager of the store that i was in and he opened two of the different packages for me and let me test both of them one of them worked the other didn t the strange part of it was that we couldn t see a visible difference in the two units and then one of us noticed that on one of them the jack had two small black stripes around it that s this one and if you look closely at the picture you can see them while the other one the one marked as nokia compatible had three hmmm curious so my advice is to either know your phone well as in have the little book handy or ask for help before purchasing all in all of stars i d give it stars on performance and comfort but have to take it down a notch for an extended period of getting used to it and for confusing packaging addendum several months later the little piece of foam has fallen from the end of the boom so that any sound from the wind becomes almost unbearably loud for the person at the other end and living in windy providence this is a bit of an annoyance also for a while i was having a problem where the earpiece would cut out for seconds at a time so that i couldn t hear the person on the other end of the line and likewise they couldn t hear me unless i jiggled the little jack this was very frustrating now for some reason i m not having that problem anymore i m not really sure if the problem was due to my phone or the earboom either way it s something buyers should be aware of
0,i have bought seasons of survivor on unbox and both of them are not complete very dissapointing guatemala episode is from a completely different season and it is missing the last episodes and the reunion show just leaves you hanging exile island is missing the final episode it just goes from the competition between danielle and cirie for a spot in the final to the live reunion show

1,my son loves this cereal i always had to buy it at a health food store where it is usually almost per box so when it was on sale i would stock up i finally started buying another peanut butter cereal that also did not have gluten ingredients he said he didn t like it as well but i thought he was just imagining the difference well i decided we would do a blindfolded taste test to prove he couldn t really tell the difference he was able to identify the panda puffs as his favorite every time no matter how we switched them around he has even asked for a case of this cereal for christmas guess that convinced me that there must be something to this cereal to make him like it so well when i received a gift certificate through the kidzeyes program as a prize i used it for some gluten free grocery items from amazon i liked the items we tried so much i started an astore to promote the great tasting gluten free foods that are available at reasonable prices from amazon com in fact that s the name of my astore great tasting and gluten free here is the link i have several items listed including envirokidz panda puffs with personal reviews of each we have five people in our family eating gluten free and quality is very important to us all the items i have on my page are personal favorites now i order gluten free items from amazon about once a week for my family sure beats going to the health food store over an hour away and paying much more for less selection
1,the godfather the game allows you to live the godfather movies the storyline and characters pertains to the movies very well the missions get repetitive over time because every mission involves driving driving and more driving but overall if your a fan of the godfather like i am you wont care respect the family
1,very nice product holds lots of things especially able to put full size pieces of paper in a zippered compartment which is very useful for me
1,dwell is a unique in my opinion magazine and i like that unlike many if not most magazines that revolve around home design this magazine does so with environmental concerns in mind as well as style and as someone who appreciates the less is more mantra i like the fact that the magazine shows off abodes that are small yet spacious like in the april issue where aloft in the forest where an urban yet forest feel loft style home on a compact lot are shown using easy and affordable ideas for the interior elements yes the magazine has ads but to their credit they must screen clients so that what ads are there fit the style of the magazine no fluffy dust catching junk
1,i ve been wearing glasses for almost years now its been difficult to find a decent way to clean glasses that doesn t either streak or damage the lenses especially with ar and other coatings they put on glasses these days the sharper image eyeglass cleaner does the trick it also by design cleans your frames which is a plus i would have given stars due to the size of polishing cloth they supply its sufficient for only cleaning one pair of glasses i have two pair regular and sunglasses so no real fault there i recommend getting a microfiber cleaning cloth as an alternative to what is supplied
1,i first watched this movie in a class a professor showed this movie and talked about oedipus complex i am not sure about this concept in it but sure enough this is an excellent movie
1,i love this chair we have traveled to several family members homes with the booster and it has worked so well i have also referred people to the web site to buy one for themselves
1,when i got the machine and started putting it together i noticed i was missing a few small pieces understandable i think as this machine was shipped from germany and a trip to my local hardware store later the kettler kadett was all assembled i had some problems with the foot straps loosening while i exercised but i found that a velcro strap fastened around the toe area to provide an additional foot strap and some velcro adhesive slapped on the existing foot strap fixed that problem with the exception of those minor nuisances the kettler kadett is an amazing piece of machinery when i use it i can tell it s not going to break or fall apart at the nuts and bolts it went together easily and it s solid as a rock when i use it i ve never rowed on a real boat in my life but this feels just as i d imagine it would and of course the most important part when i get off i feel like i ve gotten a gym quality work out out of stars for this rowing machine the packaging could have been better and slightly re designed foot wraps but all in all an excellent buy
0,i am not a right winger whatsoever am against our involvement in the mid east but did read this book i can t say it better than alan dershowitz who commented about chomsky s writing in general many people buy his books and the page that is folded down is never greater than page

1,received exactly as stated my only complaint is in the description they don t state the length of the cable my tower for my computer is in another room that i keep at degrees which is maintained constantly i had to extend this cable by soldering on another feet of wire as the usb ports that are connected to my computer are mounted on my wall i projected the cable to be about feet and if you do yourself you re in for a surprise this cable is only about feet long otherwise everything is fine one last thing the description doesn t state this but the cable actually comes with the drivers for the phone models which really helped me on a better note shipping took a mere two days compared to the six days usps estimated

0,i have this radio and it s a pos remote isn t very responsive and the display is waaaay too bright will keep you from sleeping if you are a normal person and the user interface is terrible the thing gets lousy reception and in general there is a reason why this is always the lower priced ipod type radio on websites they are trying to get rid of it because it s cks
0,i bought her because martina mcbride is my favorite singer and then my lil sis gotm madded and she chopped of the head year old
1,what can i say that most of the people reviewing this cd haven t already said arthur is outrageously talented it s almost shocking the depth of songwriting and production values are so intense it s extremely well recorded and mixed music anyone into audio manipulation should just buy all of his albums right now stumble and pain is probably my favourite track the sinister tone of it and the synth effects are just superb as with all arthur albums the vocals are dense layered and its something he s obviously worked on for a long time and it really pays off on this album anyone new to him should buy this immediatly and buy redemption s son straight after that what a musician
0,i purchased this expecting a high quality satin robe but what i received was a run of the mil polyester robe yes it is shiny but it feel like plastic sadly this will be returned
1,this series is exactly what the english love about mystery and crime it s a tad bit dull compared to what we are used to with cop shows and series like the shield that being said this series is well done and does capture you over time rather than individual crime stories this series contains only one crime investigation if you like drama and cop stories this is a good one
1,this is a very nice looking and sturdy table a nice extra is they ship a small bottle of touch up paint with the product the table may look nice now but getting there was a pain in the neck on the positive side it is very well packaged no worries about any damage during transport not a small issue for many items that said the instruction sheet included was for a different rectangular table with completely different legs even if it was for the same table it was in that hard to understand translated into english using a dictionary vocabulary there was a nicely vacuum packed card with all of the bolts and washers as well as an appropriate wrench that fit the bolts unfortunately there were bolts in two sizes and washers but holes waiting for bolts in the table all of the bolts were too long for any of the holes even with the washers i ended up getting a bunch of extra washers and few shorter bolts at my local hardware store if you need to do this make sure you get stainless steel so rust will not be a problem the bolts provided required between and washers each before they could be adequately tightened whew finally done the table is serving us well on the patio it replaces a glass topped model which flipped over and shatterred in a big wind last fall the open weave design is nice very easy to clean the top give me a couple of months to get over the trauma of assembly and i might give it stars
0,while the story may be entertaining in its own right and any chance to see donald o conner dance is worth it this can be a very disappointing film to porter buffs the plot has nothing to do with the stage play except that some of it does take place on a ship the story line is totally different and therefore some of porter s original songs have been taken out and replaced by songs of sammy cahn and james van huesen which do not live up to porter s quality the best examples i can give is the fact that there is no evangelist so the title song anything goes turns into a second act number sung by mitzi and chorus with horrific word changes and blow gabriel blow becomes a finale in the broadway show sung by the four main characters that comes at the end of the picture and has nothing to do with any character or plot line if you haven t seen it on stage it s pleasant enough but if you re expecting the broadway show it s a major disappointment
1,my wife brought me this watch as a christmas gift i could not be more pleased nice big face and rugged decent quality i may just get the gold or black version next
1,i just wanted to comment on sarah s comment which highlighted intelligent men and her took seven hours to put it together my son wanted to time me and watch me put it together without help i agree if you treat the instructions with intelligence it will be complicated i took it in parts after reading it fully twice after all the small parts pole height adjustment apparatus rim backboard i carried it all outside and put it togehter one picture was complicated becuase of the small detail being overshadowed by the backboard overall i got it done in parts total time with breaks in between have fun and enjoy watching your kids smile brighten
0,i picked this book up a couple days ago with a few others hoping to learn about america s prison system i think our prison system is horrible and i was hoping that this book would give me some more information on the topic unfortunately in the first twenty pages of the book elsner claims that america imprisons people per every citizens if you do the math that equals of our population of our population is greater than the population of the state of new york according to this author there are more people in prison in this country than live in the state of new york before you get too worried let me reassure you that this is not the case america imprisons people per citizens as of or of the population this is the highest rate in the entire world so there s no need to move the decimal point to make it seem more dramatic for comparison stalin had of his citizens imprisoned in the gulags during the height of the purges again there s really no need to exaggerate america s rate of incarceration what disappoints me is that this error is not simply a typo on one page but is repeated several times apparently the author actually believes we imprison of our population and the editors at prentice hall think that makes sense as well as do all the luminaries who glowingly endorsed this book on the back cover personally i can t take anything this author says seriously if there are errors so blatant a novice in the subject can them pick out on the first twenty pages no less if a subject as basic as prison population is exaggerated by a power of how do we know the rest of the book isn t off by a power of elsner makes prison reform advocates look like the bunch of uninformed dreamers conservatives like to imagine don t buy this book
0,this product does work but it has to face the sun so if you put it in the window that faces east it will work in the morning not in the afternoon it needs to be put in a window that faces southwest to work the way they claim in the tv ad also they are hard to place with powered windows

0,listening to this album made me question my own life it is simply unoriginal boring and really bad save your money
1,in and jim henson s the storyteller aired and became an instant showpiece for television a truimphant but short lived series breathing fresh life into nine lesser known northern european fairy tales and later into four timeless stories drawn from greek mythology these old folk and fairy tales mined from countries such as germany and russia and compiled in discs here along with the greek tales are vigorously and appealingly narrated by two storytellers john hurt for the european fables and michael gambon for the greek re tellings but with much respect to mr gambon who himself does a fine job it is john hurt who decidedly draws my attention hurt with the more eye catching portrayal is ideal as he inhabits his storytelling character with a gleeful and quirky charm and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes it doesn t hurt that the stories featuring hurt as the host boast clever and sensitive screenplays written by anthony minghella who nearly a decade later would win an oscar for directing the english patient as such jim henson s the storyteller gloriously lives up to its titular billing john hurt s performance sparkles with his enchanting delivery as propelled by his captivating voice and effectively off kilter mannerisms and abetted by heavy make up he evokes a rich verbal miasma which sucks the listener in to his stories minghella s screenplays are replete with rich witty wordplay and evocative descriptives that indeed recall to mind the classic fairy tales with which we grew up the kids of course won t have that frame of reference but still watching these episodes it really does feel as if you re sitting around the fire enraptured at the feet of a master spinner of yarns michael gambon on the other hand is burdened with the weightier and grimmer greek tales thus he eschews john hurt s light ebullient touch opting instead to display a more proper and somber persona he s pretty good mind you but in the final analysis he ends up lacking a bit of something when compared to john hurt both hurt and gambon by the way are accompanied by the same mangy talking dog as operated by brian henson at a half hour per episode jim henson s the storyteller is presented in a marriage of live acting creative animatronics and surreal and stylishly vivid imagery jim henson and his crew do a marvelous job with the production values coming up with excellent special effects for its time seamless puppetry matte paintings and yeoman make up work all to plant the viewer firmly in their fantasy setting a charming quirk of the series which adds a nice touch is the interesting ways the folk tale would continue to make its presence felt during the occasional interludes with the storyteller and his dog the camera would cut away from the story and focus on our host by the fireplace but somewhere in the background whether it s on a painting in the back or on the surface of a display jar or cup images depicting the story are set in motion pretty neat the stories themselves are more mature and darker in essence than any kid s fable we re used to over here especially the greek entries and several carry melancholy and bittersweet overtones the soldier and death the heartless giant but don t keep the kids from watching this series everyone should get a chance to fall under the spell and feel the power of stories it does help that most of these tales are little known in the states thereby giving the viewer a chance to enjoy the unfolding of a fresh story and be actually startled here and there when was the last time cinderella or beauty and the beast timeless as they are offer up anything new this is just about as perfect as television shows can get the only flaw i can come up with lies in the dvd set as it comes with no special features whatsoever all the episodes are superb but if i had to pick the best of the pack i would definitely go with hans my hedgehog the soldier and death and the three ravens with several recognizable name actors lending their talents to this series jim henson s the storyteller the definitive collection truly is a must have dvd set spoilers follow the nine european fables hans my hedgehog from an early german folk tale a barren peasant woman desperately craving a child naively says aloud that if she had a baby she wouldn t care what it looks like soon enough she gives birth to a baby who resembles a hedgehog much to the father s dismay and the scorn of the villagers fearnot from an early german folk tale a carefree absent minded boy who never scares goes on a strange journey to learn fear though still very good this may be the weakest episode of the lot gabrielle anwar has a tiny nonspeaking role a story short from an early celtic folk tale the storyteller himself is in the spotlight as he narrates the time he was caught making a fool of the royal cook and as punishment meted out by the king must tell one story a day for a year all goes well until the very last day when the storyteller suffers from storyteller s block brenda blethyn has a part the luck child from an early russian folk tale seeking to avert a prophecy which foretells of a seventh son of a seventh son of someday supplanting the current king the unscrupulous monarch seeks out this luck child and attempts to do away with him but those blessed with luck cannot be undone and the same could be said for prophecies the soldier death from an early russian folk tale this is an awesome story because of kind acts towards three beggars an honest soldier returning from war is given a magical sack a deck of cards and a nice whistle which he uses to save a kingdom and to foil death the true bride from an early german folk tale shades of aslan a white lion comes to the aid of a girl jane horrocks little voice being held under the cruel care of a troll co starring sean bean the three ravens from an early german folk tale a wicked witch miranda richardson weds a widowed king jonathan pryce and then recognizing that the king s three sons and daughter pose a threat to her ambition transforms the three sons into ravens but the princess joely richardson escapes and is told by her brothers that unless she remains speechless for three years three months and three days they ll be trapped in their raven forms forever sapsorrow from an early german folk tale this is a variant on cinderella or is it the other way around as a beautiful princess the unimpressive alison doody seeking to escape an arranged marriage flees to a distant kingdom and disguises herself as a loathsome hag but then she falls in love with the prince co starring jennifer saunders the heartless giant from an early german folk tale on the whole giants are benign creatures harmless to none unless of course the giant hasn t a heart this story is about a curious prince who is fooled into freeing one such heartless giant from the king s dungeon the greek myths daedalus and icarus the inventor daedalus and his son icarus flee from the wicked king minos with the aid of daedalus s man made wings but will icarus heed his father s advice i m guessing not orpheus and eurydice the musician orpheus descends to hades to bring back his dead wife perseus and the gorgon the hero perseus faces the gorgon medusa theseus and the minotaur it s theseus with some help from a beautiful princess versus the savage minotaur half man half bull

0,although it s listed under the accessories section for the it is not for the well i guess it will work with just the phone but not the extra battery no sense in having this if it doesn t charge the second battery i checked it out on the motorola site and in fact it is the wrong one this charger is the motorola which doesn t work with the and battery the correct number is the
1,i love these inserts i had trouble finding ones this size not too big not too small they definitely help me to fill out my bras i would suggest putting them in bras with pockets for inserts i tried just setting these in my bra but if i moved my arms up and my bra moved around i was afraid that the cupcakes would fall out these are a great product though
1,i love this bracelet but the clasp is seriously defective i contacted sabrina and they were great about sending me a new one asap with a label for returning the other one that was impressive and such responsive customer service is not to be undervalued still the clasp is a product defect and i m sure one of these days i will probably loose the bracelet b c it comes undone unknowingly
0,i was very disappointed with this program but i was also thinking it would be more comprehensive and include more than just basic words and phrases even so the male and female guides in the program often pronounce the words slightly different which can be frustrating i learned more icelandic along with correct pronounciations while in iceland than i did with this program and besides anyone under the age of in iceland speaks english
1,this product is definitely worth the the leather is nice and what you can t see from the picture is that the item is held into the case by a plastic covering over the keyboard when closing the keyboard the plastic does catch a little but i think that will go away the more i use it the phone fits snugly into the case and no part of the screen is covered by the leather exterior access to the buttons have been made easy each exterior button is given its own hole in the leather the ok button and ptt button on the left are covered by leather however there is clear markings in the leather designating ok and ptt the leather faceplate is secured by a magnet providing easy and quick access to the touchscreen on the flopside of the faceplate is a convenient mesh pouch for memory cards or etc another thing not mentioned in its description is that it comes with a belt clip however there is no place to secure the belt clip onto the case highly recommende
1,this is a must have if you own the compatable shotgun but a good tip if you get it would be to dump your bbs into another container and check through them for imperfections they will jam the magazine pros very high cap more than enough for a spring gun cons a bit long and protrudes from the bottom of the gun quite a bit but still worth it
0,this has got to be to most poorly manufactured item i have bought in a long time six of the plastic deviders were either cut too short so they wont fit into both groves spanning the opening or were bowed in an arc shape so my day monthly organizer is now a or day organizer you would think that someone would check the quality of something they are going to attach their name too and sell
1,i use this on my macbook works flawlessly to hookup a tv via svideo osx handles this supremely well by remembering any video settings that i use when i have it hooked up plug it in and video switches to tv settings unplug it and its back to normal i use this with dual view mode so that my desktop stays the same always on the macbook and i just get extra desktop space when i plug the tv in the quality is quite suprising for s video very good must have for anyone that has a nice tv
0,this is a cheap plastic except for the metal tube toy it s like those hand claws for kids you squeeze the handle and the claw closes the grabber part on this thing has a opening you won t be able to grab a small can of soup the magnet is weak and is located on the outside of one of the grabber finger on the inside of the fingers they have rubber pads that are removable probably for cleaning but they seem to come off on their own
0,this is a great idea for a great marketing group little kids who want to listen to music just like the big kids the has a few issues of it own but the speakers were disappointing the sound quality is not good even with the volume turned up it is difficult to hear another huge down fall is that a power cord is not available so you can end up going through batteries pretty fast to top it all off my son has difficulty getting the correctly mounted into the speaker unit on his own overall we were very disappointed with this accessory
1,i use this constantly i ve bought every limited edition of the set that shows up at sephora i don t blend it in though i dab a line across my top eyelid and let it dry not too much but it s still so vibrant that a little goes a long way i ve reccomended this to everyone
0,you can try this for free for up to days by registering with microsoft and downloading an evaluation copy when you re sure you want it permanently activate it with the product key you get in your amazon package the new version of excel has two huge advantages it removes the old column row limitation you can now have columns and more than a million rows excel can use all the cores processors in your computer or you can restrict it to use only some so huge background calculations do not tie up your machine on my dual core computer excel is way faster than at almost every task i ve seen no crashes hangs or hiccups but everything else about excel is frustrating the new ribbon interface is unnecessary and awkward almost every operation takes more pointing and clicking than older releases bypassing the ribbon with the new quick access toolbar is problematic because bizarrely microsoft has deleted many distinctive command icons leaving them with identical green circles right now excel costs more than excel if the two plusses don t help you you may think that is worth more
1,i ordered this for my son for his birthday they told me it was backordered i was so afraid he wouldnt have it for his birthday i sent them a email and they answered right away i emailed them one day and had the present days later even through this is a small company they took care of a long time customer now

0,tepid entry in the collection lorre s moto a bit of a bore
1,in this book dulles offers a simplistic yet useful overview of the way the church has been viewed throughout its history he focuses primarily on the catholic church from dulles analysis there are five basic ways to understand the church he explores how these models have been used over time as well as their particular strengths and weaknesses in the rest of the book dulles explores some of the issues surrounding ecclesiology he has also added a new model which is a synthesis of the other five my only complaint about the book is that it makes divisions too simple and straightforward rarely is there a church that fits all of the descriptions of one model or does not somehow combine several models the book is helpful however to pastors who seek to understand the thought patterns of the members of their church it is also helpful to congregants who desire to understand more fully what it means to be the church all things considered this book is an asset to pastors students and anyone involved in ministry
1,this is great instant oatmeal i eat it almost every morning i used to buy the quaker or store brand of the same flavor in the grocery store but i will continue to buy this it is very convenient to order this in quantity even though i m the only one in my household eating it since i go through it pretty quickly

0,i was lured to this product by a rebate which made it free the manufacturer computer associates burned me for the rebate and will likely do it to you too as for how it works no trouble installing like others have mentioned but it slows my computer to a crawl after a while you will shut it down and then you can resume surfing the net at normal speed

0,this bra is very comfortable once on getting the bra on however is not always as comfortable since it goes over the head it rolls together and is hard to get adjusted correctly over your body as far as function it is not easy to resnap one handed which with a baby is all you usually have to work with the star rating is only for comfort stars for function
0,this film sucked harder than a boatload of whores during shore leave i originally saw it for free and afterwards i still felt screwed it stank so badly that i checked the soles of my sneakers on my way out of the theatre yeah i know call me mister tact a horror comedy that s neither slightly funny nor remotely scary this film is a supposed sequel to the horror classic an american werewolf in london which is possibly the best werewolf film ever made the filmakers had a lot to live up to and boy they blew it in every department the effects were ludicrous the cast was lost the script was bathroom tissue with identity issues and the director should have been shot with something other than lots of narcotics this film is a textbook example of the hollywood machine clanking its way through a total goatscrew if you have already been suckered into buying this dvd i feel your pain you are undoubtedly now using it as a coaster for a heineken or as a tool to chisel old dingleberries out of your asscrack
1,this is a great bra for any mother that is looking for a nursing bra i live in the us and had a terrible time finding this bra in any store or anywhere on line it s a fabulous bra it s very comfortable washed up nicely and provides great support this is our second child and i wish i had these with the first
0,i bought this product a few months ago and now it has stopped working ans i do agree the smaller the hair straightener the better i originally had a smaller one that my salon uses but it also stopped working the light is on and the heat comes off and on randomly very upsetting
1,many great things have already been said about this lens and i will support them my copy delivers outstanding sharpness nearly on par with my even wide open rare for a wide angle of all but the finest german manufacturers great color very little distortion many objective tests have revealed that it s probably the best of breed ultra wide angle and impressive contrast surprisingly the build quality is not bad tight fitting mount damped rings and no jiggles or rattles if i were forced to offer a slight negative it would be the bokeh of the lens is somewhat marbly however when shooting a subject with an oof area differential high enough to make bokeh a component of the frame then the subject is likely going to demand far more attention than the bokeh a fine lens canon definitely worth the premium over the sigma and tokina rivals both of which i sampled before purchasing this optic
0,this magazine is chock full of supplement advertisements advertisements in fashion magazines are annoying but supplements can be unhealthy and dangerous these ads may have something to do with the target audience of the magazine it seems to be directed to women who are hard core about weightlifting and fitness to the level of competition a recent article in the magazine was talking about what percentage of body fat was too low for women some of the women had body fat below i m trying to get mine below it s just a different fitness weightloss league completely i like magazines like fitness and shape better because it sets more reasonable goals and provides more reasonable advice i can substitute toast with jam for bagels with cream cheese i can t drink protein shakes for breakfast and lunch eat servings of protein a day and pop potentially dangerous pills i am very disappointed with this magazine
1,i got this as a present when it finally came back in stock the scrub part of the stick does a great job but you need to have lips that aren t in dire need of help for it to really work to do that just use a moist soft toothbrush and gently scrub the scrub side will sometimes leave a little sugar behind so you might have to wipe your lips off a little after you use it but i found that this doesn t happen all the time the balm side goes on smoothly and feels great it s silky feeling but does not provide a lot of moisture so if you lips are on the dryer side this is not going to replace your regular gloss this stuff is great for on the go and i will be buying it again when mine runs out
0,dull dull dull if i could have submitted a review and given zero stars i would have pointless
1,i bought these shoes for my husband i ordered them on a monday and they were at my house by wednesday i have owned a pair of real birks before and these look identical to them my husband loves them and they wre more than half the price of the real ones
1,i purchased this item to remove some debris off my camcorder lens and found it to do the job very nicely the microfiber texture feels nice a little beady but soft and textured using it was easy i just wiped the lens in a circular fashion with light pressure and eventually the debris was gone some fingerprints and what appeared to be a scratch but wasn t the packaging is a little subpar though it comes in a plastic bag which you tear open at the bottom to slide the cloth out however doing so leaves adhesive residue which the cloth then sticks to and you have to tear it off making those sections of the cloth appear phyically different a bit roughed up i d say this is poor design as the packaging says to store the cloth inside the bag when not in use to avoid contamination so i used a scissor to cut the bottom of the bag with the adhesive residue off i ve yet to machine wash it but so far it works well it s just a cheap lens cleaning cloth after all
1,based on negative reviews either i ve been knitting too long to still have good sense or completely in the dark when it comes to this magazine it is my favorite and i do not always follow patterns exactly but use ideas in my own sweaters i found about cardigans in just the last issues a reviewer didn t find any in a couple years of issues re zimmerman type designs you can make any sweater in one or two pieces change gauge needle sizes yarns etc search websites to give you the basics for free after years of crochet i learned to knit at age with pencils for needles found that quad ruled pads were great to chart patterns whether plain fancy aran jacquard sideways or you name it i like knit n style thanks for reading this
0,the phone was very annoying everytime i tried to call on the phone it would not connect i would have to either change the channel or just not call i was only able to connect to the number i was calling once in the times i attempted to call i returned the phone and went and purchase a different manufactured phone consumers report was very wrong in their rating of this phone the phone was terrible
0,as a year old i felt a little out of place buying this soundtrack but i was so excited that i had finally found a soundtrack to these two wonderful movies imagine my disappointment when i could aurally pick out that rosemary clooney s parts were not sung by rosemary clooney i do not recommend buying this album enjoy the music when you watch the movies instead trust me it s better that way
1,an incredible task carried aout by two prominent researchers in the field arato and cohen accomplished a great job in this work the reader both will find a lucid theoretical evaluation of the concept of civil society and will have a better understanding of twentieth century political philosophy also the book does not only summarize the basic arguments and debates about civil society but also offers a new understanding of our social and political world by their genuine model as a researcher in the field i do really appreciate their effort and thank these two brilliant researchers for their fastidious and meticulous work
1,my boyfriend bought from the earth to the moon and since he is an astrophysics student i expected that he would have enjoyed finding about people s conceptions about going to the moon at that early time he however summed up the book by saying that it contained a lot of basic things didn t make much sense well from a layman s perspective i found from the earth to the moon engaging it goes into the technical aspects of going to the moon and involves a reasonable amount of logic physics and astronomy even from my scientifically deprived perspective a lot of things in the book didn t make much sense such as the actual method of getting to the moon but this doesn t really take away from the book it adds greatly to its appeal the book contained some bizarre bits of humour and its whimsical nature never bordered into the ridiculous i was kept wondering how much of this was actually going to work and what these poor souls were going to come up with next compared to twenty thousand leagues under the sea and even journey to the centre of the earth however from the earth to the moon is noticeably less imaginative verne uses everyday objects and ideas to make his ideas a reality and much unlike his other works doesn t stray far from the earthly some people may feel cheated by the predictable conclusion but all in all from the earth to the moon is a good read if you drop at the sight of f x y then this book is not for you because it involves some logical thinking centripetal forces and the like which may be hard to assimilate if you really know your physics theory then you may not appreciate the book either because of the theoretical meanderings that may have limited basis today if you like me are somewhere in the middle of these two extremes then from the earth to the moon is definitely worth your time
1,in late i decided to give in and purchase the gaming system at the time that was the original xbox having not been a real dedicated gamer previously and only played on and never owned systems i had little knowledge of how it d be upon use but since halo had just been released to rave reviews i knew i had to try it out hey it s halo people man i was glad i invested in it it s a bit large compared to my best friend s and is a bit difficult to lug someplace but the graphics are much better than the and the games available for it are great significantly the critically acclaimed halo series of course the best game out there in my opinion there are some issues with how bulky the system is but it s about the quality of gaming rather than how bulky a gaming system is
1,a quick search in amazon books under the name benjamin franklin comes up with matches based upon that criteria many people would say that everything that could be said or that needs to be said about ben franklin has been said those people would be emphatically wrong as has been proven by author and historian h w brands in his work on franklin the first american the life and times of benjamin franklin brands expertly brings this pivotal figure in american history back to life once more in this book which was a pulitzer finalist in this book is not only about franklin but its pages are dotted with an unbelievable cast of secondary characters brands brings the friends and acquaintances of franklin to life ranging from cotton mather to sir isaac newton the book also spans the life of franklin from his humble beginnings in boston to world acclaim as one of the pivotal architects of american society and government i believe this is the finest biography written on franklin since van doren s pulitzer prize winner of some seventy years ago of course a book about franklin would be incomplete without also being about the creation and formation of america as the two are intricately attached but brands work here is all inclusive giving us not only the politics of franklin but his creative genius business sense and so much more we ve grown to appreciate about this senior statesman in american history i have no idea how many biographies i have read about benjamin franklin but this is definitely one of the best ever h w brands has a wonderful writing style with flowing narrative meticulous detail and is one of the few franklin biographers who successfully point the reader to franklin s human side rather than keeping the attention on his mythical status monty rainey www juntosociety co
0,there s a ton of paper in this book overboard in my opinion wading through the pages in search of a hike is downright laborious i ve taken quite a few of the sierra hikes and the information hasn t been detailed enough to really give me a feel for what to expect on the trail they miscalculated the mileage and sometimes the elevation i think it would be a better book if they chopped out half of the listings and concentrated on the truly best hikes in california
1,after reading the reviews and reluctantly we bought the stroller i am glad we didn t listen to those naysayers it was the best decision we made because the stroller is wonderful the comments people wrote about how the stroller is awkward and heavy is a bunch of rubbish yes the stroller is heavier than its predecessors but they fail to mention how sturdy it is we ve had the stroller for weeks and we hike up some hilly mountains stanford dish if you are from palo alto and it rides smoothly it gives me comfort that the stroller is well built and protecting our two daughters year old and weeks old enfant i feel secure that the stroller will not fall apart after a few rides like its predecessor also we love the capabilities spring shocks for a smooth ride shorter so we can navigate through some tight corners and it is not awkwardly long like the other double strollers we have a toyota sienna and it fits just fine in our back trunk as for the weight yes it is heavier but come on it is not times heavier people exaggerate too much if you are accustom to carrying your pound toddler in your arms then the stroller is nothing people are too much of a wimp it is slightly heavier than its predecessors but not by much they made it heavier because the load baring bar is what keeps the stroller steady and sturdy gives me peace of mind that my precious asset in life my two daughters are protected the only recommendation is that the back two wheels could squeak which can be annoying just use silicone spray and they all went away we ve been through rain dirt and hot sun with this stroller and we ve been so happy with it i highly recommend purchasing it but make sure you have a truck mini van or suv i am not sure if a standard vehicle can house such a stroller but i figured if you have two toddler enfants you may consider getting a bigger car
0,i have a mouse intensive job with dual screens working on digitizing maps unlike the reviewers before me i have a normal size hand over the years i have developed a slight pain on the top of my wrist my favorite mouse so far has been a microsoft wireless mouse similar to the design but with the fake leather on the palm which is no longer available i saw this ergonomic natural mouse advertised on microsoft s website six months ago and purchased one the second it became available the mouse caused instant pain in my wrist i tried using the mouse for a week in different positions thinking i just had to get used to the mouse my wrist pain just got worse after a week the pain in my wrist was so bad i wasn t sure it would ever go away not only did i have pain while using it but for days after stopping although i have a mild pain in the top of my wrist from normal mousing this mouse caused pain in a different location at the base of my thumb i returned the mouse and returned to my old mouse
1,looking for a nice well rounded magazine with the major focus on contemporary interior design miss superb printing quality clean european lines meticulous attention to details you ve got it all in this magazine after moving here in the us from a major european capital i have frankly missed a good magazine with the latest trends in metropolitan interior design architectural digest is great if you live in a grand mansion in ladue but what if you want simple and elegant functionality of a nicely designed european apartment or loft in your typical suburban house this magazine has been a delight to read nice coffee table edition too it has been a source of ideas and inspiration for me for several years now recommend highly
0,the adorama silica gel came without any instructions on how to use and reuse it i emailed customer service at adorama to ask how to use it and how to recharge it once it has absorbed enough moisture but they did not respond i can t tell when it needs recharging and when it is ready what color should it be and what color should indicate recharging how to i recharge it nothing tells me how to recharge it so far money wasted unresponsive to my emails
1,as a kid living in iran this movie was my favorite though it is an old one
1,got this for my grandmother who loves tea great gift looks great and teas smelled wonderful
1,okay i ll have to start by saying that i don t play many role playing computer games i m a fan of the genre but i tend to play strategy command and conquer style games so when i picked this one up i didn t have a lot to compare my experience to i was immediately sucked into the game and the controls were not hard to learn despite what another review said character progression is cool giving a fair bit of control over how you develop both skillwise and alignmentwise do you want to be good or evil it s your choice and effects how the game plays out the optional quests and main story quests are all cool but i have to warn you all the final battle is way too easy i beat the whole game without maxing most of skills without having most of the really cool legendary weapons and without doing a lot of side quests but you can continue in the game world after it ends just let the credits roll for aprox minutes though there are no new quests you can run around and tie up loose ends like opening demon doors and silver key chests
0,this movie is so dumb that it s as good with the sound off as with the sound on the only reason to watch it is to observe the extreme beauty of both leads a plot as old as the written word could still form the basis of an ok movie with a good script but this script has no charm no wit no nothing
1,i actually bought different pair of diamond ear rings the gold ones were the keepers they are pretty and big enough to use as a second pair in my ears thanks to amazon for this offering
1,reading the reviews of this camera reminds me that cameras are tools an imperfect tool in the hands of a master is much better than a perfect tool in the hands of a amatuer i am not a master but i do appreciate this camera for what it can do and what its limitations are when you use iso settings higher than you will see increased noise i think it is a great little camera and i have used it a lot on my latest photo project keep in mind one of the assets of this camera is its small physical size this also means small optical lens less light gathering ability there is no way to compensate for this in the camera so know this is a limitation and deal with it
0,this dictionary is just another long winded pretentious unreadable high brow attempt to legitimize anthropology the authors of each definition are more concerned with impressing their peers than giving the average person clear insight to cultural anthropology if you are struggling through a cultural anthropology class and are looking for a dictionary with clear definitions forget this book
1,great product i found it to be very easy to use and hassle free
0,i purchased this digital picture frame after doing my homework and reading all the reviews i could on the different kinds the one i purchased was flawed and would take or tries of inserting the memory card before i could get it to boot up when it was running i was very disappointed with the quality of the pictures what the description of this product does not tell you is the frame does not come with a usb cable so it does not hook up to a computer this means that you must either have all the pics you want to display already on a memory card from your camera or that you must have purchase a card reader to download the pics from your computer to your camera card a side note if you have a sony digital camera memory sticks do not allow you to back any pics onto them from your computer that were not taken in their format so forget about using pics someone else sent you took with another camera or you reformatted with a photo program i went with the digital pic frame from brookstone instead far better quality and much more user friendly
0,these cards only work with camera that supports the write acceleration otherwise the speed is no different from a card there is nothing wrong with the card in terms of capacity or quality i have given a single star rating coz it should clearly state that the speed is only possible with cameras supporting write acceleration very few camera support this technology and one can easily get the same capacity at the mentioned price so why pay more if your camera does not support this technology
0,i d like to give this game a good review but unless you read the fine print you may be as dissapointed as i was to discover that it doesn t work on lcd televisions it also is incompatible with rear projection and plasma television sets

1,like most of the reviewers i went into this book expecting the humor and absurdity of the website and it s all there in it s ridiculous glory however this book is almost like two books in one upon reading the footnotes a much deeper tale begins to unfold beyond the nonsensical ramblings of robert the book tells a tale of a lonely kid using ninjas as an escape from his sad life his parents hate him he has no friends and nobody else listens to him except his babysitter and faithful dog the further you read the more you begin to see the deeper story unfold however even while the story gets darker the humor remains creating an experience that is both hilarious and touching check this book out
0,my first two black cartridges worked pretty well in my hp deskjet then the third one started to indicate low fluid level and stopped printing i replaced it with a new cartridges but it refused to work at all while repeatingly trying to reinstall it as tech support suggested the etch tore when examing the inside of the printer i found that black ink had splattered around inside the mechanism area indicating a leakage the next new cartridge would not work either wasted tech support said to have the printer repaired ya sure after only one year of moderate home use and the warantee had ran out printer repair would cost me more a new one
1,the instructions could of been better on the hooks and the net but you could figure it out you had to take the target out that they gave you because if you hit it it would slow the ball down then you just put ribbon on the outline of the other target otherwise i it is holding up great so far
0,i bought a pv about a year ago it worked for a while now it won t read old disks and even with brand new disks the chance of it being able to read the disk are not good about of the brand new disks i have tried it won t read i will never buy another panasonic product again
0,i am a yr old mother of a yr old not only are these children horrible singers but there is a reason that most parents don t let their children listen to the original songs they teach them things they don t need to know i thought this would be a kids version that would get rid of that stuff when i let a child i was babysitting put the cd on and was appalled at how much they talked about sex and other innappropriate things for children they didn t take that out children are exposed to that every day in our world now telling them it is normal and ok parents have a big enough job to teach their children right and wrong with the way the world is today it becomes a much harder job when you give them something that is for kids that teaches them that those things are normal they assume if it is ok for a kids cd it can t be that bad i think this is horrible and would never spend a penny on it for a child some of the songs i like in the originial version and do listen to and this cd has ruined them but when it comes to children who are too young to understand that it is just a song and doesn t mean what they say is ok i think it is the worst thing you could buy for your child
1,i really feel like this is the best overall coffee that i have tasted as the name suggests it is intended for espresso but it makes an excellent cup of regular coffee i love this roast for my lattes because it is so easy smooth yet full flavored if you are in the midst of a decision for what bean to purchase make this your choice you shall not be disappointed
1,as an interior designer i was very pleased with the quality of these patio chairs i liked everything about them even the cushions were thick and comfy enough for even the heaviest of my guests i have other sunbrella cushions that are way to thin to be comfortable throughout a meal these cushions let you sit and eat for hours
0,this movie is the worst piece of clap trap that i have ever seen built in the mold of the rambo series the film tries to play off of the west s fear of the soviet union you d be better of watching a how to pour milk instructional video than watch this film that will make you less smart
0,van dyke parks did the arrangements on sam phillips s debut the indescribable wow an album i love so much i thought i d give song cycle a shot what a feeerocious disappointment i d give it zero stars if i could but amazon wouldn t let me my god that singing voice of his reminds me of david bowie the laughing gnome bowie that is i ve seen the word coy pop up in a lot of reviews to describe his singing er style but i ll go them all one better smug all i hear in it is ooh i m so smart what a clever lad am i the arrangements or orchestrations or whatever you call them are all pointless it gives me the feeling that van s dad bought him an orchestra and said here son have fun so young van did without ever really learning how to use it properly randy newman knows how to use an orchestra check out his best album sail away the arrangements are tasteful and key word here spare he never clubs us over the head with them the lyrics if we can call them such have no attachment whatsoever to the music but then again since i wrote that the arrangments are pointless i guess it s to be expected so what we have is a trifecta of awfulness bad voice bad lyrics and bad music however he did make song cycle in and worked on the indescribable wow in so he did learn a thing or two in years namely that arrangements are not songs they re used to highlight a certain verse or chorus the singer really wants to put across to the listener maybe randy pulled him aside once to tell him that
1,i ve used this along with the base station for one year now i ve monitored temp and humidity inside outside and in my rv parked in my driveway works great easy to use easy to change the batteries despite the instructions you can use rechargable batteries they read low on the display but work just fine
1,i love this clock it s big enough to see from all around the back yard and looks great keep in mind that they recommend keeping it sheltered from extreme weather we have ours under an upper deck so it s sheltered from the rain that s about as extreme as the weather gets here in los angeles

0,i just received my brush es hair dryer yesterday tried it out today for minutes i absolutely hate it it s the worst by far hair appliance i ve ever owned i guess you get what you pay for but i ve owned revlon products in the past and this was absolutely the biggest waste of money i cannot return it because the return cost would be too expensive too much trouble and i guess it will go in the dumpster i hate it don t make the same mistake i made one big problem is that the bristles are so lousy not firm and doesn t grip the hair just take it from this written testimony it s a piece of junk
1,i own this seat for my son who is age it is the law in my state that children must in a booster or car seat until age the seat material is high quality and the cushioning is very comfotable the headrest is perfect for long trips since my son can fall asleep without an annoying crick in his neck the price is decent too the only issue i have with this seat is the cupholders if you have a regular sedan and want to fit others in your car the cupholders aren t very usable additionally the cupholders don t slide out very well when the child is sitting in the seat personally i leave the cupholders pushed in i have another carseat for a young infant in my sedan and must fit my year old in the back seat i wish carseat and booster seat makers would instead make a mesh bag pocket hang right off the botton front for kid toys and such furthermore with booster seats in general i think they are very impractical for families who need to fit kids across the backseat my son has a very hard time buckling his seat belt because he must reach to the side where space is at a premium i would love a forward facing booster seat with a point harness that would lock into the latch loops for the older child not only is a point seat harness safer but it is much easier for a child to buckle themselves instead of reaching around to the side as far as the options available for a child who has outgrown a convertible seat but is too small for a regular seat belt this is a nice option
1,i love this old paul newman movie the plot is terrific the characters and all the family personalities are very realistic the story taking place down south is refreshing paul newman is very sexy i highly recommend seeing this movie if you are a paul newman fan
1,version seemed to go off the track by changing many users favorite features like form ordering along with how unattractive bookmarks had become more than anything version increases one s ability to collaborate securely providing complete control over your document who can open print or even comment on it but version is more of a fix than a major upgrade as it cures many of the ills of the previous version best of all adobe has kept the price the same very nice
0,it does not work unless sunrays fall directly on it i wouldn t suggest this product
1,this is a very thorough very exhaustive look at the life of the sixth president of the united states and while it may not be as easily readable as say david mccullough s truman it is certainly less dry and slow going than most scholarly works if you re looking for a full life biography of monroe one that truly informs you on the subject and does not simply dramatize the story of a historical figure s life this is an excellent choice if you re looking for light reading with a historical basis this is definitely not what you re looking for
0,i saw this pair of shoes and thought that they were very cute however when they arrived they had smalls stains on over the front of the shoe very very disappointed i will return the shoes and never order anything from this seller again

1,darkness for those who wonder what the title film means is not the only time of the day tenebre s would be victims should be afraid of when a psychopath starts imitating the murders of one best selling author s latest creation before you can even say what the this horrorfest has already delivered the goods with style and flair never has it been more fun to witness the untimely premise of its cast with a touch of ingenuity from its director and a killer score to boost tenebre is a strong and inspiring piece of film that is a definite must see undoubtedly one of the best efforts of dario argento s career martin bouche
1,i found la ciudad a very different movie from any other movies i have wathched this movie is split into four narratives of latino immigrants living in the city of new york immigrants come to the us with many dreams in their minds these dreams include getting higher education or getting thier childeren higher education getting rich and living a happy and high standard life this movie shows how these dreams of immigrants are turned down and broken because of the exploitations at thier workplace and the laws of the city and the government this movie also shows how the immigrant children are affected from these laws and exploitations for example luis s daughter dulce cannot get addmission to school and ana cannot do anything to treat her ill daugheter who is not with ana i like it how the movie is shown in black and white it really matches with the narratives that are shown in the movie it also indicates that although immigrants hope to have happy and colorful lives in the us they are not able to have them because of the laws and exploitations overall i really liked the movie and i would encourage anyone to see it
1,this is a traditional telling of the life of jesus from before his birth to the resurrection the cinematography is breathtaking the color the costuming the writing aided by carl sandberg is flawless and inspired and the scene of jesus weeping and then raising lazarus from the dead is awe inspiring it was this scene which motivated me to write this review rather than showing us a thunderous awakening from the dead within the tomb stevens has jesus lift the hem of his toga and make the difficult climb up a rocky bluff puffing all the way to the tomb on top of a hill once there jesus strikes a pose made popular by the style of ivan mestrovic and the french bronze sculptors of the mid twentieth century when jesus reaches the high tomb stevens and sandberg compose a masterpiece of prayer to the god of life before jesus calls out lazarus come forth but in striking juxtaposition stevens pulls back the camera hundreds of feet from the tomb showing jesus the son of the almighty as a mere speck against the infinity of the countryside let alone the universe much as the fist fight between charlton heston and gregory peck in big country shows the scale of man to god s work however as jesus calls out lazarus instead of seeing him rise we see the wonderment the bewilderment the fear and love of men at the prospect of one man raising another from the abyss we see in the crowd as the camera dollies rolls and scans the faces of the believers the unbelievers the doubters and the ever faithful their reactions to a man dead three days reawakened by an act of god brought forth by a human being favored by god how much more effective was this direction rather than a straw man of seeing the dead rise we see instead how people like us would react to such a thing the awe the tears of joy the fear the love the attempts to reconcile with reality the unbelievable there was no better way to show the spectacle and that scene alone is a must see for an aspiring artist or film director my only complaint about the film is a nitpicky one jesus max von sydow hair is too short if you believe clap your hands and even if you don t its worth the minutes of your time i saw the film with friends when it came out in and own the vhs and dvd and watched it with a group one of which was a self proclaimed atheist he had tears in his eyes at the lazarus scene star

0,so this page turning thriller was on the best selling list for a gazillion months and put catholic and fellow christian faithful in a defensive uproar i m fairly well read and yes i ve earned a few bucks with my prose i m also a sucker for historic tales ancient folklore mythology and old testament characters who lived for years and begat like rabbits ok i decided now that it s in paperback i ll give it a read what i concluded was this those who found the da vinci code an affront to their faith could have could have ended the argument before it reached the level of theological debate by countering that brown s work is a literary steaming pile i read page after page waiting for the moment when i would start to give a rat s ass about the da vinci code s protagonists what a bunch of twits langdon is a leading authority in the obscure field of symbology i don t know if i spelled that right but i m not about to go back in that book and check it apparently there are enough people in the world who crave more symbology that langdon s books sell better than brown s entitling him to the academia equivalent of rock start status sophie is effectively portrayed as a cuddly french chick who s easy on the eyes someone a man might make a hit on before the first pages if he wasn t a dipwad like landgon she s got some inner deamons that make her interesting enough but she s been isolated from folks like you and me in a cradle of artsy culture so high falluting most french probably couldn t tolerate it and then they hook up with that insufferable aristocratic british snob teabing from cradle to some approptiately haught estate near but of course versaille this memeber of the royal lucky sperm club has never had to lift a finger to earn buck or a pound or a euro so he s been free to pursue his fascination with bigfoot rumors about how the priory of sion opus dei and those cool holy grail knights from the third indiana jones movie have contrived through the centuries to keep the lid on damning evidence that jesus made a baby girl and god had originally intended women to be in charge of everything or something like that oh i forgot teabing s crippled so i should feel bad about talking bad about him anyway this trio of prententious intellectual clods sit around do what pretentious intellectual clods do make lofty self affirmed pronouncments about how the world s going to turn upside down when this cat gets out of the bag the point is that these characters aren t very approachable and brown does little to convince me that this secret will destroy christian faith as we know it hell it s been more than years since darwin presented pretty clear evidence for evolution yet the christian faithtul still pack churches around world but back to how bad this book is trite doesn t begin to describe some of the wincing turns of phrase i would give you some examples but like i said i m not going back in there one of the more laughable scenes of upper crust idiocy occurs when langdon and sophie meet up with teabing in his metrosexual parlor by now sophie and langdon have somehow eluded the grasp of professional killers several times been on the run and are exhausted with a straight face brown describes how sophie s delirium is sated by a spot of tea and her hunger is satisfied by crumpets yes crumpets hell teabing shut up about your conspiracy theories roust your beligernet butler and have him fix these people something to eat offer langdon a stiff drink i sure needed one at this point by now i m pulling for the albino then they escape the jaws of death yet again and naturally high tail it to england on teabing s private jet i hoped maybe teabow would turn back upon discovering he d left his grey poupon behind i stopped reading it about pages later when it became clear that the albino wasn t going to get a chance to wack any of these intrepid protagonists i don t know how it ends i don t care however there were plenty enough nuggets of research on the subject to entice me into watching a few nice documentaries laying out this whole conspiracy on the history channel and discovery who knows you might like it this is just my opinion
1,for the first quarter of the book i thought eugenia was to be polite a witch she slowly became likeable all of poor cyrus s choices in clothing were so tacky the story had a good blend of romance and mystery after reading this book and all the talk of glass i have a serious interest in collecting glass art
0,you could get the same info on percentage of body fat by going online think about it how does a scale measure your body fat good question so i went to the website of the manufacturer and surprise surprise there were no details about how this worked it did however note what it was supposed to detect and how that might connect to body fat the scale supposedly measures something called electrical impedence which sounds pretty complex but really isn t all that hard to understand all it means is that the more fat you have in your body the more impedence you have and the higher the body fat reading electricity doesn t flow as well through fat and the scale is supposed to detect that but here is the catch getting an accurate body fat measurement can not possibly be done by just stepping on a scale especially if the consumer buyer of that scale doesn t understand the factors that are vital to an accurate measurement what you have in your body when you step on the scale is one vital factor here is just one example of how easy it would be to get a bad reading if you are dehydrated from not drinking enough water or conversely you are overhydrated from drinking too much water or you haven t measured your body fat within a certain amount of time after exercise or you ve been standing too long or you ve eaten recently you are very likely to get an inaccurate reading and you ll be confused by the variation in readings from one day to the next not knowing what factor or combination of factors is affecting your reading even worse you ll have no real idea of your body fat from what i ve seen these scales do provide accurate weight measurements but when it comes to measuring body fat the ads or website do not seem to indicate that you can get an inaccurate reading if you step on the scale at the wrong time of day too soon after exercising if you are thirsty etc so save your money if you are working out regularly eating right getting in shape etc odds are that your body fat is dropping and you ll see signs of this you don t need this scale to prove it although you might consider it worthwhile to discover your actual body fat some other way signs of reduced body fat are firmer muscles looser clothes and often a more streamlined figure your metabolism is likely to be more efficient assuming you don t overeat too much if you absolutely have to know your percentage of body fat just ask your local physician trainer or gym director how to get an accurate assesment and when to do so if you workout regularly at the suggested or peak training level your body fat should go down assuming you don t compensate by eating too much so don t count on this scale to give you the consistency or quality of a detailed and controlled body fat measurement it won t

0,this is such a ridiculous excuse for a toilet seat lid it s easy enough to install but hello what s to stop anybody especially a toddler from lifting the entire seat and lid together not a thing the kit that comes with it to secure it to the toilet rim is a joke in that it rattles around like crazy and when it s closed it doesn t fit snuggly around the seat so it s completely loose total and complete piece of junk

1,the avobath bath bomb turns water a lovely luminous pale green avocado olive oil lemongrass bergamot rosewood oil gardenia extract makes this a skin calming soothing moisturizing dream the green luster makes this bath especially beautiful and gives it a mermaid mood i loved this one so much i m ordering two the next time the scent is lemon lime but by the time you get in the tub the floral scents are more prominent you can add in some bubbles but they don t seem to last very long well i was using a bath gel so you may want to find a bubble bar because the olive oil seems to make them disappear pretty fast at least that is my theory because i ve noticed bath oil does the same thing avobath goes well with whoosh products or the happy hippy shower gel if you are in the mood you might want the amazing godiva shampoo and conditioner in bar has a magical quality makes hair super shiny or the i love juicy shampoo and veganese conditioner the last two also have a citrus scent and are especially delicious when i use lush products i m in a good mood all week long it is truly amazing how happy and content i am as long as i have some lush products around the rebecca review

1,i have tested this unit on maximum sensitivity at first i was bothered with the constant tick that is an indication that the baby is ok so i took the sensor out to see what would happen without the baby it stopped ticking the baby was not moving but just it s heart and or lungs working keeps the unit ticking it detects even when you blow on the sensor maybe it should not be on maximum sensitivity since ceiling fans etc might activate it but i was truly amazed with the sensitivity you can turn the tick down so it is not too bothersome it is like a clock ticking about once a second when baby is ok if it stops ticking for about seconds a noticeable alarm will ring
1,purchased this so my year old can wake up on his own for school i checked several stores and was dissapointed to find nothing suitable for a child didn t want radio cd telephone and other features pros very compact size fits good next to bed ac adapter with battery backup even came with batteries lcd display doesn t have annoying illumination while trying to sleep blue glow activates only when very easy to find button is pressed straight forward buttons and controls that took about minutes for my year old to learn buttons are a good size and are not real hard to press great styling as a kids clock the projection feature is a big hit projects about high numbers on ceiling projection intensity is good for laying in bed at night without lighting up the whole room decent construction for the cons none for my particular application note if you are looking for a projection clock to use during the day visible projection in sunlight you will be extremely disappointed
1,this is still the best one out there but this new version been getting yearly updates since adds very little finally updated a couple streets in our area so that alone was worth it

0,i want the two hours of my life back after all the talk about what a cult classic this film is what a waste of time maybe this movie was a novelty to american moviegoers in that time is past even then the robots attack people concept was hardly new now this is just a boring b movie with bad acting and anticlimactic action this film is only good for academic or nostalgic purposes unless you are doing a research paper on american sci fi cinema or you are in your and enjoyed this movie as a kid or you just like boring anticlimactic b movies avoid this dull piece of drivel i feel cheated
0,bought at a local builders warehouse super sale for and the time i used it i was amazed at the speed with one page so then i tried with five pages it jammed and i had to reverse a few times i finally got through that first batch but then it would not turn on automatically again turns out the small limit switch that activates the shredder in the paper slot had gotten jammed backwards with the reversing i was able to get it back in place and made it through two baskets of nicely shredded documents pages at a time a few weeks later it jammed again and it took awhile but i was finally able to reverse and forward to clear the jam however the small cheaply made limit switch was no longer part of the unit it apparently got shredded and now i have a nice steel wastebasket so i cannot complain bottom line great for pages at a time but forget junk mail with more than one page folded and still in the envelope unless you open unfold and feed pages at a time
1,i got my slicer past black friday for from radio shack to use in the case of emergency the virgin plan c min pay as you go is excellent for people like me who use cell phone for what they were originally made to do first phone card lasted me little bit over months one has to recharge account once every three months to keep the account active despite a fact that i even made couple overseas calls that were very reasonably priced min to eastern europe i used the phone on my business trip to call home the reception was excellent in all states i used the phone so far the virgin web site is excellent the account is easy to recharge they also have planty of ring tones and graphic options for downloading mostly priced about per download the phone is nice looking and has all fancy stuff except a camera however the memory is really small for more serious web browsing but one would not expect more for i am surprised to hear that other people complained about the battery life my phone holds charge about days on stand by the only bad thing i discovered so far is that after the switching off the phone for example during the flight i had to reconnect phone to charger in order to activate it again i would sincerely recommend the phone and the virgin pay as you go plan to mature users

1,i bought this hood after reading elsewhere that it fits the f mark i the version with the metal mount and distance scale that i purchased recently canon specs the discontinued es hood for this lens the great thing about this et is that it is longer so it blocks more stray light without vignetting on full frame or frame slrs the interior on this mark iii version is also flocked providing a bit more light absorption i ve used those collapsible rubber hoods before while in college but this hood is definitely worth the investment well built fits backward on the lens for storage but too long while the lens is on the camera and provides good protection for the front of the lens it s quite deep note that this will not fit the newer f mark ii version all plastic mount with no distance scale

1,the main appeal of the grand theft auto franchise has always been the freedom it gives the player to explore vast amounts of territory and cause mayhem as he sees fit san andreas contains by far the most audacious expansion on the landmass available to you this time the action takes place in california inspired locales such as los santos san fierro and the las vegas inspired las venturas all within the enormous state of san andreas the main inspiration this time around is the fascination with ghetto culture that was so predominant in the early s this provides a great opportunity for rockstar to take advantage of the setting and implement some new challenges for the player to conquer new to grand theft auto is the concept of territory control as a member of a street gang the player has the opportunity to take over every available territory in los santos later on in the game perhaps the most notable additions to the franchise are the ability to customize your character s appearance and improve his varied skills throughout the game these may seem like rather superficial additions but they are surprisingly satisfying when implemented properly the character s skill growth happens naturally and rarely interferes with the freeform exploration that players have come to expect from the series the customization of your avatar varies greatly and encompasses most fashion styles found during the early in california the lower tier stores offer the usual assortment of baggy pants and sports jerseys while the more expensive stores offer suits expensive jewelry and trendy fashions your characters appearance can be as varied as you want it to be and it does not stop at just clothes and tattoos his physical fitness can also be changed the grand theft auto franchise has improved in almost all aspects with each subsequent release and this one proves to be no different as the last game in the series to use this outdated engine it pushes it as far as it can go in terms of graphical prowess the graphics are slightly improved over the previous installment but they remain sub par to the standard featured in most games released around the same time nonetheless the visuals are quite effective as the sunsets fill san andreas in an orange tint and the game s color palette faithfully replicates the feel of the early nineties california culture the soundtrack aptly replicates the time period which san andreas draws its visual style from and perhaps the one complaint on this subject would be that rockstar seems to try and encompass far too many genres of music the expected genres can be found such as hip hop and alternative rock both of which had a strong presence in the early nineties pop scene however some stations seem oddly out of place in the game world s era dance music and funk each get their own stations yet it hardly seems worth it although too much choice is never a bad thing making a welcomed return are the various radio station djs who each pepper the time between tracks with hilarious chat and amusing observations for those that would prefer to listen to nothing but banter there are two radio stations with a talk radio format one public station holding discussions on the day s political events and another with light talk shows either one of these stations is more than enough to keep the player amused for hours but just in case the pc version gives you the added bonus of playing your own tracks by adding them to the game s music library the sound effects themselves seem appropriate but never particularly impressive there is the usual banter among pedestrians and the complaints from motorists as you pull them out of their vehicle and run off with their ride all these things add a little bit of life to the game s large cities and the voice work varies enough to cover all the different geographical areas that san andreas contains the thick southern accents of the countryside inhabitants and the snobbish tone of the civilians in the rich neighborhoods are all present the gunfire and explosions sound average with not much improvement present since vice city despite the controversy that seems to follow every release in the series san andreas is a praiseworthy title in and of itself an engrossing action game that continues to expand its limits while continuing to deliver what fans of the series have come to expect
1,the spy who came in from the cold gets inside your veins like cold bullying ice and by the end of the movie you feel numb based on the famous novel by john le carre director martin ritt seems determined to reveal the ugly reality of espionage on both sides of the iron curtain as it really was alec leamas the haunted british spy for the u s has nothing to do with james bond richard burton gives such a phenomenal performance as this rancid cranky solitary alcoholic he wasn t entirely acting that one can t help but wonder why he didnt get the oscar for best performance that year leamas is in his own words just a bloody man tired of all the ideologies on both sides of the fence which lead to all the horrors and betrayals he has witnessed and been a full participant in his paradox is a painful one rejecting karl marx god and all the rest of it he is also a man beginning to realize that his career in espionage is one of sheer immorality claire bloom s nan perry is the catalyst for the tragic and unforgettable ending of the film a young woman leamas meets while he works in a london library awaiting his next assignment from the charming and bone chilling head of operations in britan george smiley she is also an avowed communist when things come to a head and she is dragged into the brutal world leamas inhabits he tries desperately to communicate that she is only a frustrated little girl from a crackpot library but the most heinous betrayal here is leamas skillful befriending and cold use of real communist oskar werner leamas pretends to defect from the british agency and stages a brawl with a grocer to increase his appearance of discontent werner is the to whom he discloses fictitious secrets about american espionage all the while having cynical and hilarious dialogues with him about the whole situation at the end with two victims of the dirty business he s involved himself in for some vague principle protecting the moronic masses leamas cannot go on he is very much on the fence so to speak and ends up on the wrong one quite intentionally a haunting beautiful movie

1,while the version is not really bad it is horrible next to the near perfect versions on the xbox and pc the s sound and music to max payne is uneven and really scatchy when the narrative scenes are on the gameplay is still good even though some areas are cut off do to the s limitations but that doesn t hurt the gameplay too much graphics are also very scratchy and so are the characters even though all the versions of max payne don t have great character models the version looks even more out of order but the controls are better for the smaller controller the has really helps compared the xbox controller and a keyboard still highly enjoyable the game is still an intense action game with a lot of violence if you can t get your hands on any other version then the is perfect for you
1,i give this toy low marks for educational value for two reasons first humans were not contemporary to the brontosaurus and second the egg is too big to have been laid by the adult dinosaur included in the set my mother sent this toy as a gift for my son s first birthday the package suggests this toy for ages and in typical fashion my son found the box to be just as interesting as the toy itself but my three year old daughter was immediately and completely enchanted with the toy she began role playing with the dinosaurs right away i love you very much said the mama dinosaur to her baby supercute

1,a friend of mine at work just recently introduced me to the music of chris rea via this very nice best of comp he also recommended getting his road to hell cd both of these cd s were money well spent i m surprised that this artist flew by my radar screen in the s when he was at the peak of his songwriting and popularity mainly due to his top hit fool if you think it s over for some reason i never equated that song with this artist the thing i like most about rea is his musical diversity he can lay down a very memorable am pop hit like fool or let s dance and then turn around and make a great blues rock album like road to hell no matter what the genre of music this artist is very good at laying down a nice groove there s plenty of catchy tunes to be found throughout this cd auberge and especially the wonderful on the beach stuck out for me but you get many styles here and each song sets a different mood from the easy listening winter song or the catchy looking for summer or some excellent blues rock like road to hell god s great banana skin or the excellent instrumental hidden track at the end of the cd that shows off rea s tasty slide guitar skills i don t know how i missed this artist after all of these years but i m a new rea fan who now looks forward to his next album whatever style that it might be i m betting it will have some versatile playing and some very well composed melodies like this superb best of this is a nice place to start listening to this fine artist if your like me after hearing this cd you ll probably want to search out some of his individual albums i ve since picked up his late s album dancing with strangers another very nice cd most of the music on this best of cd is almost years old but it feels like it could have been written today in other words it s well composed music that holds up very well over time and i m sure if your like me and not familiar with rea s music the minute you hear fool or on the beach it s going to bring the good part of the s back to you greatest hits cd s should all be this good highly recommended
0,bought it for my nokia and it doesn t work typical shouldn t have bought a generic memory serves me right anyway
1,has insightful articles about what s hot in the business world great articles on tech companies and wonderful ideas about how to get rich honestly the best thing about this magazine is that it gives an immense amount of motivation and inspiration to the reader i would agree with one of the reviewers however that it tends to go off course it has great potential and is definitely worth subscribing to
1,after reading other reviews i was skeptical of purchasing the dioshield for my ipod i had read a lot about how it interefered with the usb cable or the hold switch but i couldn t argue with the price i must say that this product it actualy one of the best aftermarket ipod products i have puchased it does exactly what it is supposed to do protect my ipod i have no trouble opperating any of the ipod s buttons and i simply remove the case when i charge the unit i have not found that it impairs the functionality of the ipod at all while keeping it securely around my neck it is perfect for jogging weight training and other outdoor activitites i find it much less cumbersome than the armband or belt clip units as it does not impede my range of motion ultimately it perfectly protects my ipod when i am out and about which is what it was designed to do the reasons i gave it and not stars was the laniard feels a little short not much but a little and i whished they had mounted the ipod right side up like they did on the nano model over all i am well please
1,tazo s wild sweet orange herbal infusion is a nice orange herbal tea it contains lemongrass blackberry leaves citric acid rose hips spearmint leaves natural flavors orange peel safflowers hibiscus flowers rose petals natural orange essence ginger root and licorice root it is not sweet very fruity and not subtle at all a wonderful tea if you enjoy orangey teas tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea tazo is owned by starbucks their web site is fun and quirky with a zen type focus definitely worth checking out it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea on the paper tea packet tazo writes a lively blend of sweet citrus herbs and orange essences sweet yet tart this is a cup of liquid sunshine radiating multi layered orange flavors with exotic hints of spice and a distinctive floral finish wild indeed on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of wild sweet orange as tart sweet smooth licorice tazo describes the aroma as oranges roses lime this is pretty accurate although the words give hope that the taste of the tea never quite approaches i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings but not as good as numi i m soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo wild sweet orange gets only four stars
1,i have been using this mouse at work since it came out after many miles of use the scroll wheel has finally started to fail i can now spin the wheel several times before the screen actually scrolls the best feature of this mouse is the battery life a coworker who swears by his logitech mouse would change his batteries every couple of months but i usually got at least ten months out of mine i even took to dating the batteries when i installed them just to rub it in this mouse is a bit heavy and does not slide as well as some but overall i would recommend it going to try a rechargable logitech next time around
0,this is a very basic holster and often simple is best but not this time the good news the slips right in and out with ease the swivel works great and the clip is reasonably secure a minor issue becuase its plastic when the virbrate ring is active it makes an annoying rattle sound the real problem is that the is held in the case by two flimsy plastic tabs one on each side everyday use must weaken the plastic becuase after about two months one of these tabs broke on my case which meant that they would not stay put it slipped out and fell to the floor several times i replaced the case and a month later the tabs on the new case broke too due to cheap build quality i d suggest you look at third party case options instead of this one
1,very easy to follow especially if you ve used quicken in the past reports are set up just a little bit different total at top of category instead of bottom so you need to get accustomed to that overall great produc
1,anyone who gave this lotion a low rating simply did so because they don t realize achieving great curly hair is a process there is no one product that can do all the work i have thick frizzy damaged curly hair i use this lotion after using my favorite shine serum then after letting air dry for a few minutes finish with gel or mousse for hold the curl enhancing lotion really really improves the look of my curls from uneven ringlets and loose waves to an almost universal loose big curl it s beautiful the only downside is the tiny bottle for such a high price it should be at least

1,i purchased two pairs of these boots for my teenage daughter who lives in this type of ugg like boots we looked in stores and other online shoe sites for uggs and other alternatives but being the end of the season couldn t find her size we saw these on amazon in her size and thought we d try them out they were definitely worth it they are just as warm and comfortable as uggs and since the price was so good we were able to buy two pairs they are nicely made comfortable and attractive she s wears them almost everyday so they are proving to be pretty durable she is really choosy about her footwear and she absolutely loves these boots

1,adagio has outdone themselves with this creation jasmine bloom display tea starts out as a tight ball of leaves the size of a quarter add some hot water and the ball unfurls it s leaves of jasmine green tea revealing a strand of delicate white flowers arching over the green tea starburst the aroma is a delicate perfumed scent of jasmine blossoms the color is a pale green and the taste is light and mellow the hand tied tea blooms are nicer to look at than taste however i recommend trying this tea just for the fun of it
0,this is not the health magazine you d expect from martha stewart it s extremely heavy on advertisements at my rough count and really cluttered and just not good the recipes are interesting if you can find them among the aromatherapy and skin hydration ads

1,when i first saw the pen again i thought to myself why would i switch from the stick pens pencils i ve used all my life then i tried it and realized that it introduces a whole new approach to writing i now use the penagain with my left hand as well whoever created this should invent a highlighter as well for college students who want to highlight with one hand and write with the other
1,i have used both this product and the disposable kind that have stickers to keep them on the table and i like both for different reasons the disposable ones are sort of expensive but very portable when i am flying and visiting relatives the hippo one is great to grab and go around town when i am not concerned about the weight of my diaper bag i have had waiters thank me at many restaurants just fold the mess right up and clean at home my son is way too young to have a plate and not toss it and i don t want him eating off of a table that is probably full of nasty germs this hippo is really durable too i have used this same mat for over years i first got it for my daughter and it still looks great

0,for fans i suppose this would be a rather big delight for non fans it s nothing that will turn you on to the band from jersey they had some okay cheesy hits in the but listening to some of their modern songs from this collection proves how completely out of touch they are nowadays
1,the s performance is as advertised terrific colour rendering thanks to its chip configuration the camera also has the option of full manual control of standard settings making it even more usable love the joystick still find it hard to believe that panasonic has managed to fit all of this performance into such a small package final score engineering customer service early production runs of this camera seem to have a shielding problem which causes faint red horizontal bands to appear when recording in very low light conditions despite the fact this has been widely if unofficially reported by owners around the world these same owners have noted that panasonic customer service generally denies that the problem exists thankfully the problem is easily repaired by a certified technician better still owners seem to have collectively deciphered that units manufactured from september onward are alright look for cameras with serial numbers beginning with or higher you can also read all about this at dot com
1,i like that the gloss isn t goopy or sticky and that it provides a sheer wash of color that seems to stay put for a while but you don t get much product i bought flare and love the color and the way it somewhat stains your lips with a light wash of color so even when the gloss wears off you still have some color on your lips i wasn t really thrilled with the small amount of gloss you actually get in the pen but overall i do like it but don t know if i d buy it again
1,out of all the hair striaghters i have owned and i have gone through about this is the best one yet i really like it it straightens my hair perfectly and you cant beat the price
0,horrible family you care nothing for and nobody you d want in your own and that s saying a lot since every family on earth is dysfunctional even the nutty grandmother makes you want to slap her hell i really want to slap everyone on the cast crew and the writers i bought this for bucks and it wasn t worth cents these people are unsympathetic unbelievable and totally made up the women wear too much eye liner and spend most of the film rolling their eyes at each other and showing their midriffs i bought the movie because of johnathan schaech based okay on his pretty face and his presence in that thing you do but he s not even in it that much he s better looking than all the girls in it too including the phony poser lesbian with the fabulous midriff when alyssa dumps her i fast forwarded through this after the first half pausing occasionally to hear dialogue that made dumb and dumber look like hemingway in summation if you like this movie you have been dumbed down by the evil hollywood machine and i suggest you check out good foreign films like a good marriage and beautiful scandals like valmont immediately there is no excuse for liking unmoving plastic dreck of this nature
1,top line this is the best blackberry i ve ever used and among the best phones i ve ever used i can use it at work and after hours with out compromise in functionality and style size i ve been some what grudgingly using blackberry since the first pager style line text device and the is a breakthrough for me finally i have a corporate device that treats me like a consumer the good great voice dial particularly if you are a commuter with a headset no need to record your voice for each address entry just say who you want to call and it it doesn t understand you it will prompt you for more info size and appearance finally i don t look like a dork talking to something the size of my palm the phone is as small as many phone only candy bars easy private email set up as with all modern blackberries seems to have some sort of auto set up for mac mail and gmail others too i imagine macintosh compatibility i just bought the missing sync for apple mac os x usd to synchronize my address book calendar tasks and notes from my macbook pro works great the software provided by rim is not very easy to use fantastic screen and innovative outlook today style summery screen for missed calls latest emails etc look for this feature in one of the alternate themes that ships with the phone as others have mentioned the keyboard is very good coming from a full size bb keyboard i thought i might miss it but the s is a breeze to use the not as good speaker phone is functional and sound quality in general is fine nothing like my sony ericsson though i think i have a minor voice quality issue between the phone and my motorola headset the best headset i ve ever owned i think that it might be a compatibility issue more mac compatibility would be appreciated like native isync and bluetooth support

1,the bloodshot gang knows how to have a good time if you re into the whole alt country thing you know that some of it is very sincere and serious ie uncle tupelo jayhawks now i love no depression and blue earth but this is an altogether different quadrant of alternative country known as militant honky tonk or just insurgent country truth be told this incredible anniversary compilation does have some poignant serious numbers rico bell s money to burn the texas rubies blue diamond mine mike ireland s i d like to but for the most part these maniacs are not taking themselves or the world that seriously you ve got andre williams and sally timms singing i ll stick to you like glue in mock romantic seriousness with background singers going g l e u glue you ve got a song with a man and a woman serenading each other saying with deep country feeling how much they miss each other s bodies you ve got kim docter and moonshine willy belting out turn the lights down low which really ought to be a hit it s so catchy and you ve got some great deadpan covers the waco brothers do a country rave up of the who s baba o riley red star belgrade does it to ac dc s highway to hell and best of all the unholy trio turns public enemy s bring the noise into an understated redneck anthem i m only scratching the surface here with tracks over discs this is a great introduction to the rowdier side of that sprawling beast that has not a name that can be agreed on and don t miss the fantastic earlier bloodshot compilation hell bent insurgent country volume ii see my review
0,i have three baby carriers it seems eccessive but i never found one that really was doing it for me i started with gracco carrier and it turned out to be a nightmare everytime i had to put the baby inside my son was crying while i was snapping all the snaps it has there but after that he was stopping crying even though he wasn t looking too confortable when he got older mounths we bought a backpack carrier this is a really really a nice buy we loved it and so did our son the problem with it is that i wouldn t put a baby younger than mounths inside so when my other son was born we tried this new carrier i think that s the best for newborns because they don t have to support any body part more over when the baby sleeps he is in a nice position and they seem to like it even though i though his head was in a weird angle as soon as the baby gets heavier or lbs it s getting a bit uncomfortable mostly if you have i large breast as i do it slips from its place so the head of the child doesn t stand on your shoulder anymore but on your lower chest so when you have a large breast the baby s head is really really in a weird angle i think that it doesn t worth the price for the time you use it now that my younger son is mounths i don t use it anymore
1,the remote control works well with the olympus digital camera it was delivered on time and without any problems

1,this years madden wasn t worth all this hype over i have every madden so far and this one was no different than last years game graphics are o k gameplay gets repeditive at points and it doesn t have the true madden gameplay as before it s just ok not super and semi dissapointing the things that caught me off guard was vince young and reggie bush arent starters so you have to do that on your own by going to rosters and actually making them right overall i wasnt amazed also the worst part is the new controls you need to use the right analog stick to juke spin and do shake n bake moves please agree with me people
0,we live in a city and we got a minor ding on the side of the car we bought this kit a few years ago somewhere other than amazon think a auto store anyway we did what it said and did it several times it did take some of the ding out but not all of it we barely got the glue off from it a few years later we got hit by a suv when we were getting the car fixed we had the guy remove the ding and now it looks perfect sadly this thing was not worth the money or effort we put into it i also watched fox and they tested the item it didn t work for them either i know it will cost more but take it to a auto shop and get the ding removed there don t buy this product it is worthless

1,this is a great product to own we really enjoy being able to know the current outisde temp anytime we would like especially here in nebraska where we have so many extremes summer and winter the inside thermometer is perfectly accurate compared to our themostat the outside temperature is accurate within a couple of degrees compared to internet weather sites although i think the variances have to do with sun changes etc not necessarily a defect in the product the trickiest thing about owning this weather station is figuring out where to locate the outside sensor it has to be out of direct sunlight and moisture but still within range of the internal display it is a great gift and we have really enjoyed owning it
0,this book has major shortcomings stein s obsession with character over plot for one martin amis said i used to sneer at plot until i wrote a novel that had one titled night train it was hard and i used stay awake at night hoping i wasn t leaving any holes another being his obsession with show don t tell gabriel garcia marquez s novel love in the time of cholera is probably the greatest novel of the s and it s almost entirely tell and very little show and the passages stein includes from his own novels as examples of good writing were actually examples of terrible writing a taxi disengorging its passengers is categorically bad writing and stein admits he rejected frederick forythe s the day of the jackal i wouldn t read a book by dick rowe about how to make it in the music business rowe famously rejected the beatles from decca records stein excuses himself that he was going by only an outline but then rowe was going by just a demo tape better writing books are out there

1,i ve only had this scale for a short time but so far so good i ve found that in order to get a scale that is perfect or near perfect you have to spend a boat load of money as someone before has mentioned the one drawback to this scale is that you have to set it back to zero every so often i specifically wanted to get an analog scale for this reason with an inexpensive digital scale which is what i had last you can t reset it like you can an analog this scale is a great buy for only how can you go wrong
1,kit and holly are presented in this story by terrence malick as total innocents living in a prelapsarian state completely unaware of right and wrong good and evil and ignorant of guilt or sin they have minimal conception of the consequences of their actions in effect they appear almost totally to lack imagination or foresight and can barely empathise with each other let alone other people things just happen as holly sees it kit doesn t feel hostility to the people he kills they are merely in his way there is no remorse he is only marginally conscious that the structured world outside his own will eventually catch up with him these kids are like adam and eve with a limited knowledge of what is forbidden but no real knowledge of the meaning of life and death holly throws out her sick catfish showing no feeling her dog is shot as a punishment by her father indicating he too is careless of death or pain kit stands on a dead cow as though puzzled by its absence of life neither of the two seems to cry or laugh much in one way these characters might also be thought of as throwbacks to a prehistoric animalistic past where the younger man simply eliminates the older in order to secure a mate for himself just the way of nature and beyond criticism apparently so i ve read somewhere this is the mindset of the criminal who cannot see what he is doing wrong he has to get by somehow and takes the easiest path why work when you can steal if obstacles arise eliminate them people are ok otherwise live now die later this is an extraordinary film superbly acted
1,king s quest games are classic but why are they not including king s quest mask of eternity i know that it was not well received when it came out i personally liked it but just because it was not well received they won t include it it s part of the series and should be included as well
1,i received the fresh roast plus as a birthday present from my parents which has allowed me to take my coffee snobbery to an entirely new level this model has worked admirably in the months i ve had it roasting one batch at least every two days it s not automatic there isn t a good roaster that is and you need to carefuly monitor color aroma and cracks to achieve a consistent roast but the coffee it produces is balanced consistent and far and away better than anything you can buy in the store the negatives are that it does feel a mite flimsy the glass roasting chamber sits precariously on the fan unit and could easily be knocked off and broken also it only roasts a few ounces at a time perfect if you just want to roast enough for your morning cup but don t expect to be able to roast half or entire pounds of coffee for gifts the smoke is pervasive so it s helpful to roast the beans under your stovetop exhaust fan lest you set off the smoke alarm overall this is an excellent product for the home roaster who s just getting into the world of coffee roasting should the interest take hold a little more it would be wise to upgrade to a larger capacity table top drum roaster or a used commercial machine
1,the color tabs really help you know what section to look at the only disadvantages of this field guide are that it doesn t document every species in north america and that the new national geographic field guide to the birds of north america fifth edition has the blue grouse split into the sooty and dusky grouse making it more up to date still this field guide has many good things

0,i expected much better quality from thule as used according to the manufacturers recomendations this bag did not even last one trip from new york to chicago without it s interior lining cracking and completely flaking off in addition the back of the bag ripped creating two large holes in the fabric and the zipper attachments became loose and proceeded to pound at the roof of my car the contents shifted continually during travel making for a loud noise that s not unlike a pouring rain hitting the top of the car this becomes a terrible distraction while driving all in all i had a very bad experience with this product and would not reccomend it opt for one of the solid constuction type carriers they cost much more but are worth every penny in the end i thought i was saving money with this product but wound up having to purchase a sears x cargo container to replace it for my return trip back
1,avatar is so awesome i saw one episode by chance and was determined to watch them all it s got an excellent story line great characters and awesome animation i d say it s the best show on tv out there right now not just considering the cartoons either it s got a real depth to it and isn t only fit for kids but teenagers like me and adults alike highly recomended i don t know if the downloading was not working in the past but it s definitely working now i ve downloaded a few and they all work fine for me

1,i purchased my first weill recordings in the off broadway threepenny opera and lenya s berlin theater songs i have treasured them all my life lenya was of course incomparable but ute lemper carries on her special genius this new recording is as near a perfect realization of this unique masterpiece john mauceri gives the unique orchestration nuance that even klemperer missed in his masterful kleine dreigroschenmusik every member of the cast even the bit roles is perfect in the characterization kollo is the first performer since harald paulsen the origninal mackie messer to bring all of the tradition of viennese operetta to this music he is a miracle macheath has subtle characteriztion hitherto unknown except from paulsen most noteworthy is the jenny of milva two delightful bonuses in the recording a reprise in act of seerauber jenny by milva the jenny and the inclusion of lucy brown s aria after the jealousy duet there is brief dialog before most pieces which adds a dramatic integrity to the recording i cannot find high enough praise for this new treasure

1,monkey business looks pretty good on dvd years later the restoration comparison on the dvd shows the change the restoration brought a bit darkly tinted and more defined the wild plot keeps you glued to the screen throughout marilyn monroe who is the star on the dvd box has more of a supporting role here she is great as the secretary lois laurel who shows up early because the boss doesn t like her punctuation cary grant as the addled professor barnaby fulton turns in a great journeyman performance getting appropriately loony when experiencing the euphoria of youth his driving sequence with monroe had me turning in my chair with laughter to avoid the trucks ginger rogers as wife edwina gets pretty wacky when returned to youth if all youth were as lighthearted as these comedic versions it d be a laugh and guffaw every time the school bell rings hugh marlowe as the straight laced attorney hank entwhistle does a nice job of standing stoic during the crazy indian game oscar winner charles coburn the more the merrier does a great job of appreciating monroe s assets as oliver oxly the ceo kathleen freeman as mrs brannigan gives a fine performance the dvd offers perviews of many monroe films this is a great little piece of cinematic history turn back the clock enjoy
1,waterproof cases are so expensive and heavy we aren t divers but spend lots of time outdoors in conditions hostile to electronics skiing hiking fishing at the beach etc in addition to water dirty hands sand and dust are hazards this aquapac performs as described kept the camera canon safe and dry despite immersion in swimming pool etc the picture quality was unaffected but flash doesn t work well due to internal reflections well worth the price
0,we finally bought these barbie magic of the rainbow dolls for our year old twin daughters after hearing them beg for it repeatedly after each time the commercial aired at first they were very excited to play with them positives the doll is durable it encourages participants to follow instructions negatives i notice my daughters have to wave the doll a few times before the dvd hears the instructions positives the dvd provides clear and easy to understand directions so your doll can be programmed with your remote control negatives the doll set off our fire alarm a few times before we figured out it was the doll and we did check to see if there really was a fire when the dvd is not in the dolls control the volume on the tv this can be very annoying when the volume increases just as you realize your daughters have started playing with the dolls my suggestion de program the doll when your kids are finished playing the dvd or just keep it deprogrammed and use your remote taking all control away from your kids and keeping them from standing so close to the tv
0,might be a great product i can t be sure because uh hello mine didn t come with any instructions whatsover i opened it up and i was like ah hello where are the instructions but the tweezerman ingrown hair splintertweeze did not answer my questions if anyone knows how to operate it or would consider selling their instructions i would greatly appreciate it until then my tweezerman ingrown hair splintertweeze is just gonna sit there not being used like my box of floss a bag of onions and my heart

0,do not purchase this flexi skin what a waste of bucks the skin hinders the camera s functionality a very small portion of the flexi skin blocks the camera lens thereby messing up the photos i had to trim a portion of the skin away in order to take unobstructed pictures next it makes your otherwise super pimp phone look like a bulky piece of junk more akin to a zach morris style nokia from additionally the flexi skin actually traps dust and other particles between the skin and the phone this item blows in both functionality and aesthetics don t waste you money

1,much better than some of the other coffee gift baskets i ordered a gift basket last year for my mom for christmas that ended up being basically cups worth of coffee and a few mugs not worth the cost this basket contains a little more coffee as well as some cocoa and cookies ideally i d prefer to buy a basket that included a lot more actual coffee but this one is way better than most i have ordered in the past it also comes in a very nice basket which is great to re use for making your own gift baskets or for attractive storage
1,well i started on a kay special and they play good too but once i saw how fun harmonica is i stumbled onto a little better harmonica an old old hohner american ace and it played so easy i had to get the top of the line hohner and got this special in key of c it did take a little while to break in the special before it played as easy and sweet as it s step brother the american ace it has a more contained refined sound than the other two i mentioned and bends well i still find my american ace bends easier but it s probably years old and the reeds are weaker than my brand new special i am still curious about the lee oskars but for the history of hohner the average cheaper than lee oskars and the fact it is made in germany i opted for the special awesome harmonica at an awesome price they also have a short waranty unlike other brands
0,use less than times the touch screen doesn t work don t know why
1,bought this for my boy who just turned let s just say that he totally loved it and it was the first present he played with two blinking lights on weapon one light on helmet which makes the eyes glow a little pricier than other bionicles but worth it not too hard to put together just make sure you put all of the tiny pieces in a bowl or some such thing so you don t lose them while assembling the guy the folks at lego are geniuses sure it s a franchise but they re doing a great job keeping it interesting

0,if philosophy makes it for my skin i think i own it i love the microdelivery peel kit which came with of these pads when i bought the set the micro peel is awesome but these pads were disappointing they dried out in their container and they did not keep up the condition of my skin between peels which is how it was marketed in that kit i have seen no difference since i discontinued using this product seems like it could be much less diluted or could be offered in multiple strengths

1,i loved the game and the side scrolling was a nostalgic step back in time for me the game play was difficult at times honestly i beat the a game in less than weeks with a grad student schedule and immunology test in the middle finishing everything completely all levels and all star coins was a challenge in and of itself but it reminded me of the gta series because after you beat the game there is really nothing to do anymore in the mushroom kingdom the minigames are amazing time wasters i find myself playing them when waiting minutes for other people etc i have had limited experience with the multiplayer but it was very fun of you have a friend with a ds best feeling seeing the stars next to my saved game and getting to level of the where s waldo minigame

1,the economy austerity and directness of the films of fritz lang made him one of the most profound and precise filmmakers lang a master of the german expressionist film shot his first talkie a crime drama considered a landmark in the story of suspense movies it was a shocking idea for its time based on the real life killer peter kurten headlined as the vampire of düsseldorf m is about a terrorized city and a plump little man with wide eyes often chewing candy who is a pathological child killer unable to control his urge for killing the film embodies several lang themes the duality between justice and revenge mob hysteria the menacing anticipation of watching a helplessly trapped individual trying fruitlessly to escape as greater forces move inexorably in and for probably the first time in the cinema it adds a new dimension to suspense pity for the killer is clearly mentally sick he cannot overcome the overwhelming compulsion of his murderous disease and yet we see him hunted down and almost lynched as a criminal rather than treated as a sick man early in the film the killer is heard whistling the grieg theme from in the hall of the mountain king this theme inexorably becomes imbued with menace and when we see no more than a girl looking in a shop window the melody on the sound track told us chillingly that the murderer is there just out of sight the murderer is played by peter lorre in a virtuoso performance that has barely been matched in all the thrillers he has made since casablanca the maltese falcon and the mask of dimitrios when the photographs of his victims all little girls are shown to him he jumps back and twitches with horror with powerful visuals lang s motion picture is lorre s first film his performance as the corpulent hunted psychopath is a masterpiece of mime and suggestion lorre is the archetypal outsider outside the law and society because of his compulsive crimes outside the balancing society of the underworld because he is not a professional criminal he had only twelve lines of dialog in the most famous of all about a pathological killer alfred hitchcock s psycho anthony perkins lacked not only the threat of the tortured peter lorre but also the dimension of invoking our incredulous sympathy psycho reeked with blood and horror whereas the suspense of m is subtle a child s balloon without an owner a rolling ball are enough to tell us that another murder had been committed the audience trapped in its seats torn by ambivalent feelings towards the killer watched him trapped as the net is pulled tight
1,this is a must have fragrance it has an exotic scent that will have everyone around you asking what perfume do you have on it can be worn day or night the entire burberry line is fantastic

1,i think a lot of people miss the power of this movie to me this is a scathing view of how simple minded religious people are duped by ministries in this country even though this was made some years ago before the advent of the infamous tv ministries today the message is still clear those who have only a simplistic relgious outlook are prey for the kind of charletans portrayed in this movie this is certainly one of burt lancaster s better roles and he plays it with much guesto if we were to look at most of the popular ministers today we would find that many are from this dark kind of background this movie has a strong message don t listen to the word of god from others if you must believe in the wild stories of the bible do so in your own way do not sanction phoney churches and preachers with your time and money even in this modern day and age the influence of this kind of hokem is still strong mr bush and the republican party used it as a means to seek re election everyone who is a born again christian or a church goer of any kind should see this movie and perhaps get a better understanding of what the religious industry is in this country the ending of the film is perhaps a bit contrived meant to imply the dangers of man assuming the powers of the almighty if there is one still a powerful film for its time and contains a worthwhile message for viewers today
1,i got this software from office max which is on sale for on last week my year old kid start learning typing and he keep saying he want to type all the time pros settings are awesome you can choose two types of keyboards you can choose your words per min speed and many other aspects you can choose different musics or do not have any you can choose the difficulty levels games and encouraging things for kids cons still needs to find one how does it matter about cartoon chars speaking to you adult can also learn from this cd just by skipping cartoon talk

0,this is a piece of garbage the balls deflate after a couple hours the rim is so frail it won t hold up to much my friend came over and yelled slam dunk threateningly at my hoop at which point i got in between them and the hoop and said this hoop was not for slam dunking they correctly pointed out that it says slam dunk challenge right on the back board don t do it it will break when i turned it on it kept score wrong and gave points for misses so that function is worthless the only reason i gave it two stars is that it looks kind of cool but will have to find a nerf ball
1,i first got one of these as a gift back in the late when i bought my first new car it worked exactly as advertised and in the intervening years i have replaced it only two or three times it does actually work better once it gets dirtier i can absolutely attest to this as i got a new one about a year ago and the older one worked better at first after a couple weeks i dust the car about about four times a day it started to work as well as the older one i took the old one and tried washing it by hand with cold ater and woolite as recommended on the makers website and it definitely was cleaner and still worked just as well if you love your car even half as much as i do this product is worth every cent
0,i m making an exception to my usual practice of not reviewing anything on amazon due to the utter vileness of this movie i saw it when it came out in theaters and hated it and then a friend purchased the dvd and convinced me to give it a second chance all in all this movie ended up taking about four hours of my life that i will never get back the performances are thin and uneven the plot is inconsistent and the dialogue sounds like it was pulled from fortune cookies made by the cast of friends to be fair this movie does face several major obstacles it has the misfortune to depend on the acting of glorified ken doll freddie prinze jr and the vastly overrated julia stiles and in addition to trying to rise above these challenges it also attempts to survive the intrusion of ashton kutcher it fails on all counts i do not hate the whole romantic comedy genre nor do i hate the teen movie sub genre under which some would place down to you in fact can t hardly wait is one of my favorite movies i simply hate bad movies and this movie is a true abomination if you enjoy the experience of wanting to drill into your own skull then by all means buy this dvd if however you value your sanity then please do not make the same mistake i did stay far far away from this movie
0,waste of money waste of time well known cast amateurish direction plotless politically correct to the point of being stupid the film s incessant attempts at humor fail eric roberts character laughs off his grave circumstance throughout most of the film he is self important godless and emotionally false it s difficult to empathize with such an unrealisitic character the best performances in this film were given by gregory harrison and lee grant the best scene is gregory harrison and eric roberts passionate farewell kiss most authentic moment in the film lee grant s reaction to her dying son being carried off very difficult to watch through in one sitting because it s so repetitive and vapid you will wait and wait for something to happen and nothing ever does until the final moments if you choose to waste your time with this film you ll be sorry you did
0,unfortunately i forked out for this cd upon first listen i am extremely dissapointed being a huge fan of sp for years this album offers none of the harmonic resonance of green s previous work also gone are the magnificant beats we have come to expect from this artist use this as sunday background music on a rainy day but do not expect to get the party started with this album
1,i decided to buy star wars republic commando on xbox for my son because he won t let me play my pc version come to find out it seems like it plays easier on xbox this game is by far one of the best i ve ever played it s awesome i find it very exiting and actually feels like being part of a combat squad everyone in the team knows to be pro active rather than reactive i haven t seen a game yet where the squad members react to direct or indirect fire as these commandos do it you don t move with your team they ll do their job you can also redirect their orders and they will follow orders to the letter being able to inject them with bacta makes the game a whole lot better that just finding a med kit and on the other hand while you re injured being rescued by your crew definitely gives you the feeling that you are a team the only regret just a small one is that the game was so short or at least it felt like it it only has three major campains and with a game that is so much fun it seemed like time flew by i can only hope that lucasarts decides to make a republic commando ii maybe based on the missions of omega squad here s hoping i definintely recommend this game for squad based combat or star wars fans alike you ll get a kick out of it i m definintely a fan of delta squad republic commandos
1,this is a great product it takes a little practice to get the right amount of water disposables take much less b c they tend to trap the steam etc i don t see how complaints about burning your hands could possibly be true sure it boils the water it has to make steam but why would you reach inside there there is no reason i can think of why you d ever need to do that and with the first children we used this on i ve never had a bottle even become remotely stuck snug you name it not even close so don t worry about it i ve used avent and bottles as well as playtex disposable bag bottles it s not really a good use of money if you re just using formula just make it with warm water but if you re nursing your child and want dad to be able to help at night this is a must have
0,worked okay until i installed xp service pack now i can no longer scan using my brother mfc and paperport it has been a long time since service pack was released and scansoft has left everyone who bought paperport in the cold i could not care less if they now come up with software that is compatible with this kind of treatment of customers makes it clear that they do not deserve our business don t take my word for it google the issue and you ll find out that there are a lot of dissatisfied customers from now on i ll avoid scansoft

1,i saw this magazine while browsing a local bookstore and it was a magazine that stood out for some reason i picked it up and flipped through a few pages and came across an article on maggie gyllanhall i had recently watched secretary and i liked her so i bought it i m not much for fashion magazines but this is much different from others like vogue after buying my first flaunt magazine i wanted to buy more but needless to say the bookstore has not gotten any in for a long time this magazine will be great for readers who are bored with the same crap churned out in every other magazine out there
1,use care when you use it as it can be easy to break pins but it works just like it should and it s easier and cheaper than going to a watch store
0,i wish i would have checked the reviews other people wrote before buying this item these are flimsy thin little sheets that are not snug or even slightly fitted for that matter i m definitely going to have to purchase another brand that will actually fit the play yard pad fortunately there are other products that work better if this was the only option i might as well not have a sheet on at all
0,this movie could ve been something had they gotten some real actors a script and a director well they didn t and this movie is an embarassment to mankind
0,i don t usually bother complaining about products but this thermometer was such a waste of i just wanted to save someone else the trouble the temperature readings on this are sooo inaccurate every time that we check a temp it is different it varies alot just to see if it worked we tried times in a row on ourselves to see what we got every time it was different sometimes by a few degrees it reads low sometimes so you may have a temperature and not be aware and we couldn t even take it back to the store do yourself a favor by the regular digital thermometer we didn t have any luck with a diffferent brand either the ear ones are all off but not as bad as this one
0,at first glance this is a great book however once you ve read it a few times you begin to notice the bottles of coke that feature in almost every illustration the author illustrator and publisher should be ashamed of themselves we all know that kids are exposed to lots of advertising on tv and at the movies but do we really need to start worrying about product placements in children s books as well this is a clever book and i was looking forward to sharing it with friends and exploring the other books in the series the greed of those involved with this book have changed my mind however
1,very simple i do not give perfect ratings for anyone or anything

1,i have read this mag thru and thru and for some years now it has continued to be at the top of the crop it is the most superbly laid out and designed magazine with excellant content that i have ever seen to be totally honest i would much rather read and browse this any day over print magazine this is almost like a graphic design book that just gets published every months where the best designers in the world are given each about pages to just go nuts on i found it deep in the stacks of the university library one day and have been hooked ever since also for those of you who can read write japanese german and english you can have your pick while reading
1,this is only the second pair of binoculars i ve owned but i ve used many pairs before from low end to relatively high end ones like nikons and leicas i can say without hesitation that the canon have met all my expectations for clarity build quality and ease of use they are still quite heavy so you won t be holding them too long in one position but the stabilization feature provides a stable gitter free image in my opinion this feature makes up for optics that may not be in the same league with the high end stuff the canon have more usable magnification for the money for non tripod hand held applications while this is not a scientific comparison this is an example of the useability and magnification i was at the beach looking at a parasailer in the distance with the naked eye for the record i could see the chute pattern and a black speck below it with my old minolta jittering in my hands i could make out shapes of heads and legs with the canon i could clearly see two people a man and a child as well as the chute s cords pretty impressive my only two gripes that have also been mentioned before are no lense caps and the eye cups are stiff fit poorly to my face any way and are uncomfortable i find it better to fold the cups back for eye glass use even though i don t wear glasses other than that i am very pleased with this purchase and would also highly recommend purchasing from adorama camera they are quick accommodating and responsive
0,maybe it s just my bad luck but i ordered this item and it came out with the expired battery i called amazon and they sent me a replacement quickly the thing is that the replacement was in exactly the same not working condition the same problem with the battery i was suggested to shop somewhere else for this item as amazon vendor don t check the condition of the items before they ship them to customers be aware don t waste your time

0,i found strivectin sd eye cream to be a nicely textured cream but it was too heavy for my skin this is rather strange as i have dryish skin around my eyes and like a heavier eye cream this one clogged up my orbital area so much that i got millia which i never suffered from before the cream does not absorb very well but feels good to touch in terms of wrinkles i had effect i in my late s and am strating to notice the first crow s feet strivectin sd did nothing to alleviate them i have to express an opinion on the price though if you do like the product and it works for you price should not be an issue as the tube lasts forever i have used it for months easily and am now getting concerned that eye products should be thrown away after such long time yet it hasn t run out yet i give it out ot for the nice texture and an impressive advertising campaign that convinced me to try it
0,i am not at all happy with this product the instructions are terrible and the program is not at all intuitive it was a total waste of my money and time
0,i purchased these about months ago they have very little arch support and very little other support elsewhere i have been wearing them perhaps times a week to the office and home they are already ripping in the back i wouldn t recommend them however i do get many compliments about how cute they are
0,i bought this to take my infant s temperature since she doesn t like to sit and wait for her temperature to be taken under her arm i decided to test it before she was sick to make sure it was accurate and it never gave the same reading twice first it was and then and then etc i tested it on myself my daughter and my husband then i gave the directions and the thermometer to my husband to try to see if maybe i just wasn t doing it correctly and he had the same results i have taken it back to target and am trying a different brand do not waste your money on this product
0,i bought the terk antenna in an attempt to pick up some am and fm radio stations i was struggling with on my new bookshelf stereo system perhpas because of my apartment building or the quality of the stereo the antenna didn t offer me much success in picking up stations any better than the factory provided antenna i did notice improvement in the static or lack of it on stations that were already tuning in fairly well they went from great to excellent but the stations that were tuning in poorly got no better with the terk antenna overall it was probably not worth the money paid
1,this is really a nice product for staying fresh and clean feeling during long flights
0,please read naomi jakobs review for relevant magazine below it captures so brilliantly and eloquently the heart of the christian post modern kick if you have to go out of your way to claim you re a celebrity then you simply aren t a celebrity take fitness celebrity john basedow for example in the same way if you have go out of your way to claim that the post modern evangelical movement is relevant then you re claim for relevancy is simply not credible the christian church has certainly played a vastly significant role in the past years however pop culturalizing evangelical christianity isn t causing it to be any more relevant than it was when sandi patty or carmen ruled the christian top does the fact that some christians enjoy the latest musical fads make the concept of accepting a human blood sacrifice for the pardon of sins more palatable

1,this film seems to be known worldwide as a chick flick from the romantic aspects of it to the current anniversary dvd s pink cover i m an year old guy who absolutely digs this film especially due to the holly golightly character after viewing this film for the first time i developed a crush on the character holly kind of goofy i guess but it s very hard for me to dislike a character like her audrey hepburn played her to perfection the film was also brilliantly shot by franz planer and directed by blake edwards i love the film s dialogue as well it has a very realistic quality and it s so fun to hear the characters converse with each other breakfast at tiffany s is perhaps the best date movie ever conceived this film is an absolute classic that is worth subsequent viewings and it will never age

1,my sister and i loved this show growing up the huxtables reminded us of our extended family the episode where stevie wonder came on was our favorite and one of the best episodes in my opinion i do question why in amazon s list of actors at the top of the page for the season set joseph c philips is the only one listed although he was a guest at one point he did not become a regular till much later regardless this is a great collection and a must for cosby fans

1,i bought these as a gift for my husband to watch tv late at night without disturbing me he loves them the sound is fine and the headphones are comfortable
1,like of the people who played this game my primary motivation for playing through was to watch a mini season of the story takes place during the considerable gap of time between the and seasons of the show with the actors from the show voicing their characters and the music and script written by the guys who work on the real show it should not have been too hard to please me with this game and in that respect the game fulfilled but did not exceed my expectations while i enjoyed watching this extra day the gameplay left a lot to be desired there was quite a bit of variety which was nice and you get to play as almost every character from the show there were so many different types of missions that the standard get from point a to point b while shooting people missions only made up about of the game the rest of the game involved driving computer hacking interrogating sniping and such this would be really cool if all these missions were actually fun pretty much any mission involving driving sucked since the controls were incredibly sloppy interrogation was kind of fun the first time but it didn t need to be done several times there were three or four different computer hacking missions that got done over and over again so that they weren t much fun by the end of the game as for the rest of the game i d describe it as mediocre there wasn t anything spectacular about the gameplay there were too many missions where the environment was so dark that it was impossible to see where i was going and there was no reason at all for there to be two missions that involved shooting down a helicopter in addition there were too many missions that were unnecessarily difficult in my opinion in one such mission you are playing as jack and you have to defend a girl who is defusing a bomb there is basically an endless supply of terrorists who keep rushing out and start shooting at you and if the girl takes any damage at all she starts whining and stops working it wouldn t be nearly so annoying if it weren t for the fact that there doesn t seem to be any strategy whatsoever to beating the mission i must have made a dozen attempts with varying degrees of success i have no idea what i did differently when i finally beat it pretty much any mission that involves you protecting another person is extremely annoying because that person will usually tend to stand out in the open taking damage instead of finding cover and despite the fact that your partner is firing their weapon constantly they never hit a single enemy so you have to take everyone out yourself in all the game is worth playing through for the story if you re a fan of the show otherwise you could find much better action games out there
1,it is simple handy and works well to prevent shaking your camera but i am still doubt if this simple accessory really deserves bucks this wired release would be the choice only if you are not a digital rebel user who has a more reasonable price option for the additional shutter button
1,i am very pleased with this product and have had numerous positive comments about how sharp the timepiece looks the dial is much larger than most watches but i have big wrists so it was perfect the size also gives an updated look the only negative comment i have is that the watch is pretty thick and binds on shirt cuffs but that is a minimal problem great reproduction watch
0,i ordered two of these training rings one for when my daughter is at home and one for when she is at her grandparents during the week one arrived in perfect condition the other was disappointingly split at the seams so i returned it and had another one shipped back to replace it i received it yesterday and was upset to find that it too was also split at the seams so i am returning it once again and asking for a refund since i feel i will be better just going to the store to buy one that i can inspect before hand to be honest the one that arrived in tact works just fine i guess it is just the luck of the draw depending on if you receive one that is in good condition or defective good luck if you decide to order this

1,i use my microsoft streets and trips software to plan my route intermediate stops and destination for any travel via automobile or truck i am especially pleased with the ability to see and print a detailed guide for locating street addresses for those destinations with which i may be unfamiliar this is especially helpful for delivery of items to a customer whose business may be on a relatively remote street in areas that are difficult to find i have tried a few other software systems that claim to do what streets and trips does and i found none of those sustems could equal or even compete with microsoft streets and trips

1,just to clarify this headphone amplifier does not have a speaker you must attach headphones supplied or your own amp speakers also it comes in either brown green or yellow at random and is meant to clip on your belt pants it s not built like a brick so don t step on it also in the negative column i found the distortion sound unpleasant when i cranked it to however setting the level to halfway or of the way up produced an acceptable distorted sound i don t have a lot of experience with other cheap amps though so the danelectro might not be the worst thing out there in the positive column the clean sound was good there was no hum only a small amount of hiss and the reverb was mild but pleasant there s no control over reverb level or speed only an on off button there s plenty of power to drive the supplied headphones at loud enough to hurt your ears grand total buttons power distortion on off reverb on off dials volume control distortion level jacks guitar in headphone out line out one led bottom line if you don t have a headphone practice amp already getting one at the current low price is a no brainer

1,i ve had this camcorder for a week now and i think it works great except for the touch screen feature that takes a little getting used to especially when accessing the special features such as fader effects while filming the digital still quality is poor when recording directly to the memory stick but the same images taken as a still from prerecorded tape is much clearer all in all it is a good product just takes some getting used to

1,jacques tati takes on the modern world in his second sally as the perpetually bewildered mr hulot while the movie is very funny in its pokes at modernism highlighted by the house of hulots sister with its newfangled conveniences and its hilarious spouting dolphin fountain it drags some of its jokes out a tad too long and several scenes notably the garden party would have benefited by judicious paring still the movie demands to be seen by anyone who is a fan of classic comedy
0,i agree cup had too much left at the end and all i can say is pointy

0,i was a real fan of omnipage until this version the scanning speed is slug like the proof reading function has is less functional the version and it tends to forget the scanner settings no noticable new features where added from version and this seems to be a new version for the sake of milking the client base

1,twinings was founded in london england in and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas irish breakfast tea is a mixture of ceylon and assam black teas well known for its strong malty taste ok let s get down to brass tacks irish breakfast tea is not for everyone there s an old irish saying that says that a proper cup of tea should be strong enough for a mouse to trot on and this tea is certainly within striking distance of that target but if you add milk and sugar to this fine tea you will be rewarded with a smooth and full flavored drink irish breakfast tea is in a class by itself among the teas i have drunk in that it comes closest to being like coffee that is having a strong taste that gets you up and going in the morning not all teas will stand up to a proper breakfast but this one will overall i have found this to be a wonderfully interesting tea strong and robust and that s my review if you want a tea that will round out your hearty breakfast then irish breakfast tea is for you if you want tea from a great tea producer them twinings is for you i highly recommend this hearty tea

0,this game is very difficult and lengthy to program the remotes also if you play it for more than an hour the questions repeat themselves so basically if you play it once there is no reason to play it again it s a huge waste of money for they could have at least put a larger database of questions on the dvd or have more than one dvd included in the game this is a big disapointment

1,for the past few years it has been very difficult to locate candid jazz cds the label that critic nat hentoff created over forty years ago this was a real shame because some classic recordings including booker little s out front and max roach s we insist freedom now suite were on this label i am happy to report that it was not because all of the albums were being deleted but because they were slowly being remastered now some of the seminal early recordings of iconoclastic pianist cecil taylor are resurfacing like jumpin punkins and now the world of cecil taylor it is my opinion that taylor s currently unavailable at least domestically new york city r b and world of c t are two of the great new jazz recordings of the early world recorded over two successive days in october is basically a trio date with buell neidlinger on bass and dennis charles on drums and archie shepp joining on tenor sax for two tracks air and the standard lazy afternoon this disc is one of shepp s first recorded performances and the saxman apparently had trouble with taylor s music i recall the now out of print mosaic set of this material collecting some plus outtakes of air but the master takes are truly masterful and i am delighted that with this cd available once again we can all return to the world of cecil taylor

1,ignore anyone who talks about this game s shortcomings it s a fun game addictive game period although one reviewer suggests that some of the levels are too easy i say that this only goes to keep the game and the plot moving in fact let s face it when you break the tasks down events in a typical episode of aren t that complex you run you hide you shoot things you drive fast and chase people but you do it all looking sounding and panting yes the video jack bauer even breathes like him almost as if you were in the show the kiss adage is fabulously apt keeping it simple is how the game makers have kept it fun related to this is the comment about trying to make the actual game play last hours firstly the show itself is a little loosy goosey about real hour what with commercial breaks and its creative liberties secondly each hour is broken up into smaller missions and learning what it takes to do well in each section can take little time thirdly those that choose to complete their missions with finesse and higher scores will find that they re not only coming closer the hour they re also having more fun because they re acting more like the characters in the show after all i suppose that someone who wants to complete their missions quickly could just avoid shooting anyone and instead just run past the enemies or better yet if that reviewer really wants to take the hour thing seriously i m surprised that he isn t complaining about being able to save progress to a memory card he really ought to be asking for a game that s played straight out for an entire hours no saving get it right the first time just like on the show

0,i wonder if jance wrote this just to get a movie credit based on her novel one cannot help but be suspicious of writers who shift gears in their careers and write in a tom clancy or john d macdonald style just because that s what film going audiences like i do not think this is a bad thing but i like some of the reviewers here are so fed up with clich plots that just borrow from i e macdonald s cape fear or use that tired native american romanticism that certainly sells the box office tickets through the roof as for her writing style she really should stay away from those scenes where character developments have not fully grown what we re left with are people who are one dimensional like both the walker parents davy his fiancee and to some extent lani who just never convinced me that she had the fire of the budding medicine woman her male voice is very forced machismo that is typical of female writers who are testosterone challenged the men in this novel just weren t credible when they spoke i kept seeing jance speaking for them so we re left with a high concept piece that is still waiting for hollywood to call and possibly star penelope cruz as lani walker what s the tohono o otham word for thumbs down quot

0,i would not recommend this product unless you absolutely cannot afford to spend any more money for around you could get the world industries m a d balance board and get a much better looking and more durable product or you could spend around and get a bongo board if you really want the best and have the money for it you could spend about and get an indo board the zoomboard that i received was green and blue unfortunately it looks garish but a child may like the look of this in addition to the garish coloring scheme the board has a rough sandy underside this is good because it allows the board to better grip the rolling tube however after a couple weeks of using it five days each week for minute sessions with my lbs frame the tube develops craters from the sand and wears down then again if you wait it out the sand eventually will slough off of the board itself and you won t have to worry about wearing down your rolling tube but the gripping surface will be compromised if you try using this on a hard floor and not carpeting the rolling tube starts to move less fluidly than before make sure there are no grains pebbles or hard materials on the surface you are practicing on because they can easily ruin your rolling tube this may be a failing of boards that use a wood rolling tube overall this board is fun but not great quality if you absolutely cannot afford more to purchase a much better product then buy this board and use it sparingly on a carpet to get a long life out of it if you can afford more keep looking and check out the products that i mentioned above and get something that ll actually be worth your hard earned money
1,had these on my wish list and received them as a gift they are even more lovely in person they are one of my favorite pairs i wear them all the time they re very simple yet elegant and very well made especially for the price i will definitely buy more from this company

1,this was my first schleich world of knights figure given to me christmas of this year it s a highly detailed classic dragon with no moving or detachable parts the wings are an integral part of the figure as such it s safe for very young children and you don t have to worry about someone s eye getting put out as to its historical accuracy and educational value i really cannot say never having seen dragons in the wild but the level of detail is wonderful and it should encourage children to obtain the more practical members of the balance of scheich world of knights collection which are excellent as well

1,i wasn t expecting a lot from this extremely inexpensive case but i m very impressed i bought from accessory one the total cost was about the case fits nearly perfectly every hole is the right size and in the right place not as exact as possible but everything works just as well as without the case others have complained of chipping paint but in the week i ve been using this it hasn t chipped yet can t do any better for the
0,when the preview aired i was pushing the movie to all my friends based on the hilarity of the preview at that time i skeptically said i hope these don t turn out to be the only funny parts and that was exactly what happened the rest of the movie was full over overdone gross jokes crass humor that went way over the line and kept running the pee joke was funny once but even at that one time they overdid it then overdid it again and then again the harry potter parts were hilarious jack sparrow was awesome but i wished i had not been forced to watch the rest of the crap just to see a few funny parts of the movie it s another scary movie deal only worse i love the newest scary movies they are funny but really sucked it was funny now and then but a lot of it was stupid so is epic movie only worse don t waste your money buying it rent and fast forward

0,i got this phone as part of a buy one get one free promotion i changed from cingular because i couldn t stand my bill being constantly wrong the seemed like a good choice at first however it is not as resilient as advertised within the first two months my phone already malfunctioned while talking to my wife on the phone the phone went wacky and the pound sign appeared on my screen next all i could hear was the sound of someone holding down a phone key i was not even touching the phone the phone did not respond to any keystrokes or even the command to turn off once i removed the battery and placed it back into the phone the phone restarted and went directly into airplane mode this is the most annyoing features of this phone and i wish you could disable it altogether my wife s phone had to be replaced by the vendor where we got our phone mine is currently on its way to motorola to be repaired caveat emptor

1,i m a fan of three mafia and i can say maybe they kinda got a little of three s rap style in this album but i dunno dj paul and juicy j the superproducers they can never be beaten i got all the hypnotize minds albums and they did invent crunk music many people haven t heard of them cuz besides ridin spinners and chickenhead they haven t been played on the radio very much except for their new track poppin my collar crime mob s alright the beats are alright but nothing compared to three mafia some of them are some krunk songs i can get hyped to a few of them but other than that i dunno the lyrics are rather simple i m an year old white dude and i think i can put together some better bars than these dudes can but they do get some major play up here in virginia stilletos and knuck if you buck haven t gotten some airtime but there s only like songs total that are worth hearing i guess we ll see if they put out another album or not i think if they had some other fellas from georgia like t i or jeezy or something they might get some more hype who knows since paul wall s on every song now maybe he ll make a cameo i guess we ll see three mafia still the buckest and besides their new artist chrome who really is garbage they are still the kings of crunk not lil john
0,sorry guys i think that the cover says it all totally out of focus and falling apart i much prefer his later work
1,fraser s film is truly a winner in production quality his attention to detail by bringing in his theatrical savvy is a nonpareil despite all the cliches that can be stated about this film eye candy performers lighting fantastic musical score and riske scenes this film has visually appealing sequences if anyone is interested in film and theatrical production i would highly recommend the director s commentary you really get an insight to an artist in process from the commentary it seems that fraser will never be finished with this film a mentale that i admire in an artist art is a process and is never perfect this is another one of those great modern plays that works very well for the film getting to the roots of the human psyche is something films should continue into the future this film does explore the dimensionality of people i did have a problem with the didacticism of the script however though most writers try to leave it up to the audience to decide i feel that the script gave little regard for wives who are victims of their husbands having gay affairs i had to agree with another reviewer who titled his review as selfish gay guy ruins a marriage on the other hand cherilee taylor did a great job in combating this fault with the script she wasn t quite the victim her character ultimately could have become by the end of the film i was wondering how violet was making it as a once again as single woman from an audience s standpoint we didn t really see that david and kryla make up matt goes to illustration school but what happens to violet overall i would highly recommend this film with such a great interpretation on the screen it would be nice to see this staged once again in the lort theatres
0,well i dint like the smell at all i see nothing lovely about this perfum if ur looking for a good perfume to give this holiday season check out fantasy by britney spears it smells so nice or curious by britney thats a classic its a must give or have j lo s live smells really nice too so if i was you i would rather not buy it if ur giving it as a present or for urself its not really worth ur money
0,i bought this from a different vendor and started working out with it immediately interspersing it with my usual cardio workouts i usually lift weights have no prior injuries and consider myself in pretty good shape as well as pretty used to working out and using proper form i played a college sport etc after a couple days of using this product my neck and shoulders started spasming and were so stiff that i could barely move them regularly it was clearly not from the amount of weight since i am used to using much heavier free weights included perhaps i was doing the exercises incorrectly but that seems like a real risk with a video like this
1,this album is the foudation of modern hip hop the format of the album the presence of rakim his image everything was new territory when this album came out in all hip hop lovers should have this album especially people down south

1,i first came across the silver insanity line of celtic jewelry last year when i was looking for christmas presents jackpot i confess i spent a good hour and a half looking over their featured items both on amazon and on the silver insanity website the teardrop earrings i picked out were quite a success so much so that i recently went back and got this lovely pair of silver celtic knot earrings for myself i ve been very happy with my selection and i just went to pick out some silver starburst earrings as a wedding gift for a friend i highly recommend the items from silver insanity and plan to order from them again

1,i was very hesitant to purchase this bike because of all the problems other people reported with parts coming damaged rusty the only problem i had was the bar on the rear bottom wouldn t fit all the way into the slot to put one of the screws in i tried really hard to get it in but it just wouldn t budge luckily i could get the screw in on the other end so it is relatively secure the bike is a bit wobbly when your riding now i don t know if this is because of my problem with the bar or because that s just the way it is but i don t feel like it s going to fall apart or tip over or anything over all this is a really nice bike the price is absolutely the best for what you re getting especially if you choose the free super saver shipping i got mine about a week from the day i ordered it i don t think you will find another bike comparable to this for the price most recumbent bikes at this price don t offer any kind of resistance what to speak of programs or the pulse monitor it is really quiet i can do it at in the morning while my daughter is sleeping in the next room and not have to turn the tv up too loud the seat is a bit uncomfortable but it s not that big of a deal considering the price
1,this game is great to get to know your friends and family in a new light it encourages deep converasations but can also be a fun and energetic game you ll find yourselves wrapped up in topics that you d never discuss otherwise
1,we recently played bonkers at our game club as we read the instructions we were hoping going bonkers would be fun and it was bonkers is a game based on asking players questions the questions are not trivia and knowledge based questions but instead word based questions for instance a question might ask you to come up with words that end in bell during your turn you have seconds to go bonkers trying to blurt out answers like barbell dumbbell doorbell cowbell etc your goal would be to find as many answers as possible in order to hit any or all of the four answers provided on the game card for every answer you hit you win scoring chips that was just one category of questions called add ons where you find words that begin or end with a certain word the other categories are what the blank where you find words to complete the blank rhyme time where you find as many rhymes as possible in order to match those provided on the game card and letter perfect where you would find words which begin or end with certain letters the game play is interesting because there is some strategy thrown in at the beginning of the round one player the card reader peeks at the question and answers on game card and decides how many scoring chips each answer is worth so in the example above the card reader might allocate scoring chips to the answer cowbell four chips to barbell three chips to dumbell and two chips to doorbell this is done by placing the chips on the gameboard under target answer a b c or d the object is for the card reader to decide on which answers are hardest and place the most scoring chips on the hardest answer this is because if the players do not hit some or any of the answers provided on the game card the card reader will win the scoring chips leftover and advance on the board however if the players hit all or any of the answers on the game card they win the scoring chips for the correct answers provided i really like the strategy part of the game it adds a good deal of spice bonkers provided for an entertaining evening we will play again

0,i was intrigued by his the end of history i thought his trust was a brilliant book and used it extensively in my masters thesis and doctoral dissertation i only hope this latest book is a disruption in an ongoing chain of good books in the end the great disruption is a down right silly book it has a lot of usefull data but fukuyama s humanistic ideology clouds it all all his empirical data and any real understanding of history undermine his polly anna conclusion that things just have to get better because people are ultimately good fukuyama proves that the moral consensus the social capital of the earlier era has been wiped away that crime has sky rocketed and that the apparent drops in recent crime rates are only the result of high incarceration rates and lower percentages of younger men then he turns around and wants us to believe that disfunctional behaviour has dropped because people are naturally gregarious and have a natural inclination to rebuild social capital he doesn t bother to deal with societies like ethiopia that have never been able to build up enough social capital he doesn t really look any further back in history past about his generalizations about the century merely show how little he has taken into account the big picture of history he thinks based on his ideology of human goodness that things just have to get better if he had studied pitirim sorokin for a really big picture of history he would know better people can come to a similar optimistic conclusion as does fukuyama but they will need to be much better grounded in history if they are going to make generalizations about long term historical cycles for that i would recommend robert w fogel s the fourth great awakening and the future of egalitarianism fogel a nobel prize winner has all the optimism of fukuyama but with the history to back it up
1,i selected this stopwatch from the many others simply because it has the indiglo feature and i need to operate in subdued lighting other advertised features are similar to many other stopwatches in use i have found it to be quite satisfactory the readout is clear and large enough to be read at a glance i have not had the need to explore all of the features but it does all that i would like it to do quite well there is a short learning curve but not insurmountable if night vision is an issue this is the only one if night vision may be a requirement in the future it is still the only one otherwise it performs at least equally as well as any others available

0,aside from the nifty weather prediction this clock is completely impractical the projection numbers are about inch tall with minimal clarity the clock itself has a greenish background that only comes on if you press random buttons which makes knowing the time during the night almost impossible i am surprise this is sold on amazon thank goodness for amazon s customer friendly returning policy i think amazon should remove this clock and others like it for good

1,many useful features in this design compact but capable and rugged a recommended item for emergency power outages and for general service where portable power is needed starts dead car batteries pumps tires runs tools etc two design shortcomings i hoped weren t there keep it from stars it charges from either a wall wart adapter or from a cigarette lighter plug i much prefer a direct power cord connection versus the wall adapter variety shortcoming it doesn t have a self float charge cycle you must limit your charge times manually by unplugging it battery damage if charged too long ach still guess a person could attach his own float charge unit instead of the supplied adapter but heck wagan design that into it like the better powerpacks have
1,this product is a very simple to use extremely efficient tool i am very pleased with results it produced for me

1,my daughter has been riding for about years now and she was so excited to see this christmas morning of course that was one of the first things she wanted to play her grandma and i played and i was surprised at the amount of things i have learned just from taking her to her lessons i m sure there is a way to alter the game so there are more questions like trivial persuit but that was my only problem with the game there isn t questions asked every move but otherwise it is an excellent game i would definately recommend it
0,the fact that this has had no us release was an immediate warning however as a longtime fan i figured i would check it out boy is this bad there are a few decent tracks however the truly awful crazy little thing called love this magic moment only you among many others make this unlistenable miss ross is a great singer and interpeter check out the delicacy she approached the billie holliday material she is a producer s singer ashford and simpson chic holland dozier holland even hall oates all were able to take her talent and create in some cases true all time classics this is a mess diana your voice still sounds great stop executive producing your projects
1,yay this book was fun and extremely informative at first the idea of coloring at my age was a bit funny to keep it humorous for me i conjured up in my mind a tall overgrown middle aged male graduate student squeezed in a chair hunched back looking over a desk and coloring with his set of crayons anyway i digress as a doctoral graduate student taking a neuroscience course this book really helped me nail down structures of way too many things but ultimately it helped me make the grade if you get the book make sure to color in it it really does help not to mention a great way to relieve some stress from the day otherwise what s the use of buying a book like this it becomes an ordinary textbook if you don t color in it
0,i have fairly sensative skin and can use most dior products but this product made my skin peel off of my face be very careful and test this first on your hand
1,i absolutely recommend this infant seat my son is almost now and i am still using this seat it is fabulous for it s fabric options of colors and most importantly for it s roominess my son is on the chunky side being an exclusively breastfed baby he is still quite comfortable in this seat and i love being able to just attach him to the stroller as i walk my year old into her her preschool the travel system as a whole catches the eyes of many and i am always stopped by people saying what a ride well it is quite a ride if you buy this car seat it will last you for the entire first year of your baby s life thank you graco
1,i have never been a big fan of motivational books because they seem so pie in the sky if you know what i mean but a friend recommended this one to me and told me it was different he was right it was easy to read and in fact i didn t want to put it down but what i really liked was the how to part of the book after all it s no good reading about other people s success stories if you don t know how to make your own also something i thought was interesting is that the author has a website called success compass which helps you set goals and then e mails you a reminder several times a day i guess the real key to success is not allowing yourself to forget what you want and this website doesn t let you forget hmmmmm electronic nagging as the key to success hey whatever works
1,the title pretty much says it all i reserve stars for what i consider the best of the best i wanted a gluten free cereal that was different from the few i ve been eating over the years this is definitely not like the usual crispy rice it s much more substantial not air has a nice though not too strong cocoa flavor and doesn t get soggy in the first two minutes after milk or other drink product is poured on it another rater talked about empty calories i ll be generous and assume that reviewer is not particularly familiar with reading and comparing nutrition labels if a high quality rice is also considered empty calories that review would be valid but comparing the koala crisp nutrition label to the nutrition label on a high quality rice reveals almost identical nutritional values perhaps because koala crisp is a high quality rice just as rice has never been claimed to be a fully balanced meal neither is koala crisp what it is is a high quality product made with high quality ingredients none of the artificial vitamins and minerals added to grocery store cereals to make them look better and it s designed to be used as part of a balanced diet with that out of the way it s just plain good i buy it by the case and eat it several times per week for breakfast i like it that much and no i have no connection with the company at all i just love their products many of them not just this one now if they d just add this one to their line of eco pak cereals large bulk bags i d be even happier
0,quite possibly one of the worst movies of all time clive owen is really cool but not in this movie angelina jolie s polital agenda totally fueled this film what a waste of time
0,even though this is a receiver hitch mount item it does not use a standard hitch pin it is a permanent attachment to the vehicle hitch must be bolted into the hitch to remove must be unbolted this totally defeats the purpose of a receiver hitch versatility the ability to easily without tools change whatever is mounted in the hitch bad thule bad
1,every single item especially produce that comes from gristedes is top notch if i need a particular fruit or vegetable for a special occasion i know i can rely on them to provide the highest quality and best tasting fruits and veggies i was in hospital recently when a big order arrived and our grown children sat around and ate everything with dad they just couldn t believe how good it was they said never tasted any red grapes that good it s that way with everything i ve read some negative reviews of gristedes i don t know what happens to cause things to go south i can only say i would order my produce every week from them if i made the time to do it and it s not that expensive because we re on a fixed income just treat yourself to something special you won t regret it
0,i paid for a barely adequate product case it does not securely mount or protect the creative zen it is overpriced and underperforms as others have mentioned you must cut it out of the protective covering only to discover that the internal configuration of the case does not protect the screen nor clamp or positively hold the player the set up feature is a joke you have to configure the assembly with an elastic band taking it out of case voids the ability to return the product the design engineer should be fired do not buy this is jun

0,i ordered this on the recommendation of another amazon customer i wasnt impressed i though this would save me money because until then i had been just buying new copies of my favorite cds that were scrathced up i cleaned a few discs and ran them through all three processes without successful results it didnt seem to make much difference with any of my discs i dont think this is a good repairer of any disc thats more than mildly scratched my suggestion would be to just replace your damaged discs by buying another copy of your cd or dvd on amazon many of my cds i have replaced for bucks on here i wish i wouldve kept my
1,my year old recieved this red engine last christmas and for the first couple of months was used practically every day and yes i agree with the rest of the reviewers buy rechargable batteries since this engine eats them and prepare to be disappointed since it cannot pull many cars up the hills without getting stuck i will tell you that i cannot believe my son has not touched this engine since his complaint is that all it does is go around and around instead he enjoys playing out stories from thomas or making up his own train sagas my husband likes to watch the engine more than my son i don t know how other children play with their trains but the battery operated engines just cannot hold his attention for very long nevertheless for the first few months watching it is really mesmerizing i could watch it for hours perhaps instead of buying this one engine purchase a setup with more cars and track for the same money it will probably get more use in the end

1,hot water in my flask doesn t stay hot enough for a whole day out and this is a good way to bring my tea or coffee up to temperature i haven t tried heating water from cold it is always at least warm when i start it takes several minutes and the wait can be a bit tedious but it does a good job the clip which is supposed to hold the heater onto the side of the mug doesn t it flops about so i have to hold it to keep it properly immersed it cools off quickly and is reasonably easy to clean with a small brush
0,if i could give it a zero or negative rating i would when vibe was introduced it was a relevant interesting magazine that exposed me to new alternative r b and hip hop artists the mag featured all kinds of artists not just who s hot right now it also featured hard hitting expose articles that were relevant to not only the hip hop community but the world lately i ve noticed that it s nothing more than a fluffy version of the source i hate a lot of new rap music that s out and didn t appreciate mags with rappers i dislike on the cover and is it me or does it seem like since mimi took over all of the female r b singers covers and stories are horrible we won t even discuss that disgusting brandy cover this magazine sucks now and the only time i check it out is while i m in line at the grocery store yes the subscription rates are cut to the bone now but that is because the quality is supremely lacking i d advise the curious to check issues out at newstands or where ever before wasting your hard earned money on a subscription

0,the ab roller was a big disappointment for me it was more difficult to assemble because of shoddily constructed parts then once that project was done i was unable to use it as the design is clearly for someone at least or inches taller than me as a very petite woman my hands barely reached the top bar making it impossible for me to get the leverage to use the machine properly so beware shorties out there
0,i have been searching on line and elsewhere for a good camcorder as a replacement for my jvc gr which died and to go online with a video blog after much study and evaluation i chose the canon based on a salesman s recommendation frustration as to the number of choices which are available and the presence of an external microphone jack which was one of my must have options after returning home i read the review by miamian new reviewer and felt trepidation after charging the battery i tried the camera lo and behold miamian is right there is an obvious noise when recording which was not present in my jvc hoping against hope i played the tape back and just as i feared the tape had a pronounced hiss this is not just tape hiss but a much more pronounced noise which transfers to the tv when watching it rendered the camcorder totally unacceptable i took the camcorder back and like miamian ordered the sony dch i know it doesn t have an external microphone jack but after all this confusion i give up why don t they make more cameras with them the plus signs of this camera are that its menu is much more intuitively laid out and selection of the desired item does not even require looking at the instruction book the joystick selector is so easy to use to select play rewind fast forward stop pause in the playback mode and is also is used to select various menu items in other modes the wide screen viewfinder lcd is so nice to use and easy to see all others in become passe i didn t have any chance to evaluate other aspects of the camera due to the unacceptable noise which demanded rejection of the unit the picture looked ok it did not greatly impress me however and the automatic focus appeared to be slow and very noticeable in playback in essence caveat emptor especially if you re hard of hearing others watching and listening to the tape will not be

1,trip hop and lounge lovers need to have this cd at home bajo fondo tango club is not as pure tango as piazzola s nor as chill out percolated as gotan project s which makes them a band for all publics nor even one single person in my office couldn t help download at least one song of this cd into their ipods three of them already bought their copy
1,most fruits and vegetables begin to lose a large percentage of their nutritional value minutes after they are plucked from their respective vines or branches there is a synergy of some compounds that have a very short half life after being removed from their home plant when the vine is still attached and stilly green and healthy not withered and brittle nutrition from the plant is still being pumped into the tomato keeping it firm bright crisp and yummy and more nutritious

1,short review this combo is an exceptional deal for the price you get three callaway balls and a swiss army golf tool alone the swiss army tool is over bucks
1,if you want to read a book that s exciting happy and mind blowing you should read small steps from the author that brought you holes louis sachar is at his best this book is sort like a sequel to holes the main character armpit is stuck in a situation which he can not handle he is in the heat in austin texas and i think it is making him do crazy illegal things at first he did not know what he was doing was wrong but now he just hopes he does not have to go back to jail i think that this book is good for any reader and above both boys and girls would enjoy this book i think they should make a movie out of the book it would get outstanding remarks this is one out of few books that i could read over and over again
1,i bought this program for my daughter for her birthday she wanted it because she s used it at school grade i was impressed by how easy it was to install i installed it as admin and she had no issues running it under her limited account xp pro i ve been impressed with what she is able to do with the program she even made valentine s day cards for her whole class with it just be prepared to go through a lot of color ink
0,i ve found the to be very problematic with firmware version some distributed network software such as bittorrent will cause the router to reboot itself every minutes bringing down the entire net with the newer firmware version it fixes this problem but within a day starts to block or deny connections to our web server passthru tcp port making the router totally unusable tech support was friendly and helpful and the only solution they could come up with was to rollback the firmware to for our websites and upgrade each time to whenever we had the need for distributed networking so now we upgrade downgrade the firmware sometimes several times in a single week and each time we do it brings down our net i ve also found that some of the setup options are restrictive compared to other brands you cannot assign a static ip to a local computer by specifying its mac address instead you need to set the ip of the computer manually and this makes things very difficult for our laptops that need static ips also it appears that you cannot map two different external ports to the same internal port number even though they map to two different computers this makes it impossible for example to allow remote desktop access to two different local computers at the same time
1,i have pergo and cannot get it too wet or the floor will bubble the swiffer wet cloths are the perfect solution they re so incredibly easy to use and there are no water spills to watch out for once you re done i hate that i m consuming a product that is so disposable but at the same time it works so well

1,the two most respected bodybuilding supplements are whey protein and creatine they are also considered natural products or food products while whey is without a doubt extremely useful creatine does not help everybody i have used creatine monohydrate in the past and i found it to be useless it was so utterly ineffective that i just felt robbed of my hard earned money my tub still sits in the cupboard i have never used any other supplement products other than the ones that seem to be on the safe side as these both are i heard about no xplode from some bodybuilders who seemed to think it was probably one of the best supplement products to come out in years i researched it and it appears that bsn has formulated a surging creatine nitric oxide drink that seems to work with most people not everybody sees results but this stuff worked for me and that is what counts although no xplode contains some serious chemistry see below and possibly some debatable compounds guanidino propionic acid gpa and glycocamine it is probably well worth the very low level risks for the results minutes after taking this stuff i can either cardio high intensity for min flat maybe even more and complete a full range of compound weight lifts in the gym without feeling any interruption in my power no fatigue the surge is exactly as it promises you will feel that you have nitro pumping around your body it sets in at about minutes for me i feel a little woozy at first disorientated then my brain picks up and my body feels energetic put it into action and you will see results it also boats a type of creatine that prevents you from bloating up like monohydrate does i never have stepped much outside of what is considered safe but in my opinion no xplode is standing on the fence saying i am about the best bang for your buck without any serious side effects so far this stuff is getting very good feedback yes it contains lots of mind boggling ingredients but if you are looking for the creatine edge even if creatine has never worked for you before then no xplode is probably the one it can also help build muscle but even if it doesn t for you it is still worth it for the surge i am very glad that i got it very serving size scoop servings per container amount per serving calories calories from fat total fat saturated fat cholesterol sodium potassium total carbohydrates sugars protein vitamin pyridoxine hcl vitamin cyanocobalamine folic acid magnesium phosphorus calcium no xplode proprietary blend no xplode contains a patent pending nutrient suspension matrix efforsorb delivery system no meta fusion patent pending l arginine akg citral m citrulline malate l citrulline akg l histidine akg rc nos rutacarpine gynostemma pentaphyllum gypenosides nad nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide muscle volumizing creatine matrix patent pending creatine ethyl ester malate dicreatine malate betapure trimethylglycine glycovol glycocyamine guanipro guanidino proplonic acid cinnulin pf aqueous cinnamon extract keto isocaproate potassium ener tropic xplosion patent pending l tyrosine taurine endurlac glucuronolactone l tyrosine akg methylxanthines caffeine mct s medium chain triglycerides vinpocetine vincamine vinburnine phospho electrolyte replacer calcium phosphate magnesium oxide potassium phosphate sodium phosphate glycerol hydrating polymers potassium glycerophosphate magnesium glycerophosphate glycerola stearat
0,i wish i had read the amazon reviews of this item before i paid for it at an office supply store it may seem a bit trivial but the smell of this wrist pad was a deal breaker it s unfortunate too because everything else about it is perfect the color the comfortable gel support and soft fabric and the size it runs the length of my mac keyboard and provides support when i use my mouse but the smell a piercing toxic smell that does not go away it doesn t matter if i spend five minutes or five hours in front of my computer i still smell the synthetic backing of the wrist pad and it s made it impossible for me to work i finally had to get rid of it
0,this software was rated the best out of a large group of digital scrapbook programs i am very disappointed with it first of all my system resources can t handle moving the pictures so while i click and drag the screen doesn t keep up and i have no idea where the picture or item will end up it s not very precise this way the website s solution is to use my arrow keys ok so maybe that s a problem with my computer second i can t select photos easily because it brings up images that are too small to see the detail and that s with the large thumbnails so in a photo of a group of kids i have to have the photo pre selected not how i planned on putting together a scrapbook when i have thousands of photos to look through also in researching the screen freeze issue i discovered that i can only have up to pages in a scrapbook also not my part of my original plan my advice would be to go to the designers website and look at the faq s before buying it helps you to see any issues before you buy i m not sure what my next selection will be but i don t see me using this for my scrapbooks
1,like i stated in the title this isn t my favorite three in one product from philosophy i have several of their scents and i really love cinnamon buns and some of the chocolatey ones strawberry milkshake smells nice but it is very sweet i wouldn t say it smells artifical but it doesn t smell like fresh strawberries either i have used it as a shampoo conditioner quite often and i have no issues with it i have fine hair and it didn t leave me with tangles like some of the other reviewers have complained about
1,when i opened my package i was a little disappoined with this product but after using it for a while i learned to like it it is easy to use the front controls with the inno but akward to turn on and off overall a nice case shoped around and found amazon had best price with free shipping received in about one week
1,it s a pretty fun game it doesn t have a whole lot of songs maybe around but the ones that it does have are fun to sing and are songs that generally a lot of people know or would be willing to learn there are also several different modes to play in so you can play the game over and over and never get tired of it perhaps one of the best features is that up to people can play without any extra expansion packs or controllers all you need is one controller and the usb headset and you just pass it around for everyone to play i agree with everyone else though when they say the headset is very flimsy i originally was going to get a separate headset but bought the package deal bad idea you practically have to eat the thing to sing and it is small and will get caught in long hair plus you don t get the fun karaoke experience my advice buy the game separately then get the handheld mic as soon as i get some more money i m gonna get the handheld mic myself it picks your voice up better overall a good buy and lots of fun especially if you have a lot of outgoing un self conscious people
0,a handle was missing the box was retaped may be a return from a store etc overall the item is chintzy you have to assemble it the charcoal pan is painted black this will burn off slowly i am going to assemble it but this item when shipping is included is a total ripoff john

0,i purchased of these for christmas presents i tried one out in order to demonstrate at the proper time number this was dead in the box so were numbers and i didn t bother with number every flashlight was shaken more than what the measly instructions suggested speaking of instructions they tell you to make certain the light is off before attempting to charge there is a rubber button that doesm t click or sound in anyway do there is no way of telling what the on or off position is real junk says hummer made in china and all five are going back
1,this a very basic smoker it is well built easy to assemble w good instructions not much information on the actual smoking process but the internet is full of information no information on how to adjust the vent to make it run cooler or hotter do not think it should matter w gas it might just regulate the amount of smoke i leave mine open runs to hot for a smoker when set as the instructions recommended gas valve turns open i have mine less than of a turn open to achieve it took some trial and error to figure out how to get the temp low but once you figure it out the gas smoker works great would have been stars if knob on the smoker was able to adjust the temp low enough i keep mine pegged on low
1,this is a well thought of game a game where the players play along with the dvd as the gatemaster gives you commands rewards or punishiments while they are playing the game players can also watch the rules and the setup instructions on the dvd six keys of six different types will be laid out on some of the spaces as your goal is to get one of each type and rush to the center before minutes is up if neither player wins in minutes the gate master has defeated you in the beginning you write down your fears and reveal them at the end which is always fun the board has six territories each character owns a territory which has a set of the same keys you can pick up a key by landing on the key space having a card telling you to gate master telling you to or winning a duel a duel is when you land on a battle space and players wager a key for a dice roll to see who gets both there are two types of cards time and fate land on a skull head and get a fate card which allows you to do something in a certain situation a time card you get if you land on a clock a time card allows you to do something if you play it in the exact second it tells you to sometimes the gate master will give you the power to banish someone when there is reward there is also punisment if you land on the cursed key you have to pick it up and whenever you have it you cannot win if you are landed into a black hole you cannot participate until you are freed also you can lose keys during the game the gate master says stop frequently and the players will have to lisen to what he says or be punished all in all it is one of the best games out there and well worth the money
0,these compression shorts are nothing like the other pair of hind i have aside from the low grade material and poor stiching the waist band rides up around my chest it looks like they were designed for someone feet tall

1,there is no comparing the incredibly honest reviews on amazon with the high brow reviews found in the lrb one surveys average readers and the other is the opinion of people who make a living writing about books i brockeim am more like the people than the professionals and believes most of you are as well
0,we were excited to give this to our year old for his birthday after opening he loved the design and having his own cool looking notebook computer and was very excitied however the screen is very disappointing i can t even rate the games because overall i simply just can t see what is on it the product is relatively useless in a dark environment and dissapointing i should have gone to a toys r us and actually compared the product to other simular products i would suggest anyone do the same prior to buying it
0,this was a film i was anticipating becuase of the actors doing the voice over and the special effects as far as animated features go this was the biggest dissappointment the acting was good but robin williams did not receive as much screen time as ewen mcgreagor which meant it wasant as funny as it could have been but the major problem was the story yes it did have a good moral but the rest of the films story was weak boring at times and just silly i would recommend ice age or garfiled the movie rather than this film
0,i tried this toy at it s lowest volume and it s still lound enough to damage young eardrums remember that this toy is much closer to their ears than yours
1,in forty years after julie andrews performed the title role live in rodgers and hammerstein s tv production of cinderella r b singer brandy brought the role to life in tv s third incarnation of this musical classic produced by the wonderful world of disney and whitney houston who played the fairy godmother ratings were huge for the program and it even won an emmy this new production is different from the previous two in several ways for one this one is a made for tv movie whereas the previous two were shot as if they were televising a play this new version also has three new songs the sweetest sounds written by richard rodgers the music s in you and falling in love with love written by richard rodgers and lorenz hart updated special effects more modern vernacular a more empowered cinderella and a color blind casting approach lend a freshness to the classic fairy tale and i m not too thrilled with all the complaints about the mixed cast i for one am thrilled that little girls and little boys can watch this and see themselves represented no matter what race they are it s nice that for once a little african american girl can see herself as the object of desire and yes the black queen and white king have an asian son families like that are not uncommon today funny that people don t have a problem with a pumpkin becoming a carriage or mice becoming horses but they have a problem with this a few flaws exist in the film the cgi effects are sometimes a little too obvious such as in the pumpkin transformation sequence and although brandy is sweet and lovely as cinderella she s no julie andrews these flaws do not detract from the general charm of this production and don t put me off at all i love brandy s performance and her more modern feminist approach to the character of cinderella however disney needs to release a new dvd version this dvd is one of the first disney dvds ever in fact this dvd predates the disney dvd brand and logo the bonus features include a home video release trailer and a cinderella story featurette i think it s time to update this dvd release the transfer is very good but could possibly use a bit of remastering maybe some retrospective bonus materials and since an official soundtrack was never released a music only track would also be a nice idea maybe some audio commentary from the actors and producers and such despite all the flaws of this dvd treatment and the flaws of the production itself it s definitely a dvd i was thrilled to find for at a local drug store because i ve loved this production ever since it first aired in november of on abc it s definitely worth buying
1,this was the first tasty bite entree product that i bought i though it was very good and very authentic tasting there is a lot of sauce and you do need some rice or bread to sop up the sauce there was not a lot of paneer cheese in the first packet i tried maybe three small pieces still it is an excellent product

0,this book refers to philosophical basis of buddhist practices as well as technical clasification of the states to be reached into meditative absortion it is not a manual nor a guide no meditation techniques nor yoga excersises can be found on the book the style is simbolic and poetical it is an interesting book but the name does not reflect the content it will be interesting for people more inclined to scholarly work
1,at the time white was the only option red would have pleased my child more i ve found sp games which claim to work with the wireless attachement do not work communicate with ds games but as for the ds lite its a reasonable size perhaps slightly larger buttons would be nicer now they offer pink and black which is nice but exchangable covers would have been nice the stylus is just barely managable for adult hands but work fine for my child the screens are bright and no longer dimmable backlighting could be turned off in the sp one nice feature is many games allow some amout of co play with another ds even if your partner doesn t have a copy stores like gamestop often have kiosks that allow you to download demos of different games thats nice but you cannot keep the demo thru a power cycle so that s a bummer the biggest pain yet is i have not found a cable to communicate between the ds lite and the sp one does exist for the ds to sp oh an the power supply cable is different as well so while less bulky and better layout the ds lite steps you even further away from the accessories which worked between sp and ds first versions not lite such is the proprietary way i d really like to see more adult software for these things they are not far from a pda with their audio recognition and handwriting as well
0,i bought this for from best buy what a waste of money the ear gels are comfortable at first but after an hour or so your ear starts to really hurt from it the sound quality is terrible people i am talking to sound very muddled and overly loud even on the lowest volume setting on my motorola what is worse people i am talking to hear me very poorly they say there is so much background noise it sounds like i am in a noisy bar even when i m just sitting in my car people can barely hear me over the background noise racket

1,from all the reviews i read i expected certain pros and cons from this lens i was not disappointed pros very sharp lens with very good colors cons vignetting at wide open and a little too contrasty for myself the pros outweighed the cons for the price it is ideal for the multiplier cameras where it becomes a lens
0,the copy of that i purchased came without the access codes to support instillation when i called electronic arts all i got was an automated phone system press now ea s manufacturing quality control is so poor that they had a selection for products without access codes i could never find a way to talk with a human beibng about the problem the automated voice suggested solution was to send the product to them at my expsnse to prove that it came without the access code i have returned the game to amazon for a refund i would never buy another ea product

0,i use turbotax every year and i would e file also it says i can e file for and it even says that s all it will cost on one of the last windows then right before it is about to transmit it says for federal plus for state plus percent what i owe to some third party company thats for each you owe if i m paying some third company to transmit my return than why am i paying turbotax to do it also so ok i ll print it out and send it in it wants to print out every worksheet and statement for a total of pages it no longer gives you the option to just print the pages you need i am now cornered into paying the extra to efile or go through the torture of printing out pages in which i need only or dirty trick it makes the total cost it would of been cheaper and more efficent going to a good accountant other than that the program has worked even easier than ever before
1,i m a culinary historian and author california pioneers their stories culture and cuisine who spends a lot of time delving into the pages of history especially food history when i want to give my burned out peepers a break i reach for this magazine as much as i love the food articles mostly because as great as they look realistically they are quite do able for just about anyone what i really find useful is the ask martha column in which practical answers are given to problems readers write in about and then there are the craft projects i have tried several and was surprised by my success i credit this to the well laid out photos and very clear instructions my advice is if you are looking for a magazine that touches on every aspect of living and enjoying a well designed and i do not mean haughty lifetsyle then you cannot go wrong with martha stewart living also the special holiday ideas are the best ever makes one wonder how do they keep coming up with such unique ideas that are do able for the general population
0,i should have bought my girls ipods yes these mini muddles are cute in that they fit into little girl purses and pockets but that s where the novelty ends first it is not abundantly obvious to children how to work the controls to get where they want to be these are kids for crimy sakes they needs to have controls that are clear and easy my youngest has no idea how to get to a particular song because the buttons never do what she thinks they should do that s a big hint to hasbro don t design a product from an adults point of view design it for a child from their point of view a button having multiple functions is very confusing for kids so i end up having to constantly mash those itty bitty buttons until i can figure out where the song is for her second the process of getting music from point a to point b point b being the mini black hole is not a quick and easy process copy here burn there transfer to this spot drag drop to who knows where oy vey and then you discover the music isn t in the correct format so you have to start all over again as for the worth of space is a piddly amount of space but it is clearly advertised on the packaging that this is the amount you re going to get no surprises there now if i could only get the darn music into the player without giving up and chuckin it to the dog to play with an ipod might be expensive but apple certainly doesn t cause this consumer the grief and frustration that hasbro has
1,this was the first dvd i purchased after i bought my dvd player i know it took me a while to get one i had never seen the movie before but amazon com reccomended it so i took the chance it had the perfect amount of predictability and comedie and romance it s the same story line that gets used a million times and never grows old boy and girl are best friends girl likes boy but boy likes a different girl boy asks for help from girl to get the other girl boy realizes he s in love with friend girl just in time to stop her from leaving
0,my mom is an avid wheel of fortune fan and for x mas i thought i d buy this for her since it reminded me of a wheel of fortune game we use to have man do i regret it she never plays it anymore the puzzles are limited and will start to repeat within a few weeks the keys on the keypad are hard to push in and if you don t push it in right soon enough you lose your turn and the general game play is blah really if you bought this for someone it s the kind of present that they d be happy with for all of a few hours then they d let it collect dust like my mum is
1,prismacolor pencils are well known for their range in rich colors and vibrant laydown setting them apart from any other type of colored pencil i ve tried them myself and i agree the lead is wonderfully soft and therefore makes blending colors and pushing them into one another an ease to do the downside is that the lead is a little too soft and makes it harder to get the colors smooth it s easier to do with crayola because crayola has harder lead it can be done however and these are great pencils that especially go well with prismacolor markers
1,his singing style is very unique as are his lyrics he has an eclectic mix of love songs we are the world type songs and a few others on this album he has the staying power for long the long term and i would love to see him mature throughout the years and watch to see where he goes i loved streetcorner symphony it is so upbeat it can pull me out of whatever is ailing me lonely no more is my theme song for right now in my life needless to say i am replaying grooves in that one enjoy this album i sure do
0,well they looked so cool on tv that i ordered of them and i regret it it s awkward to get the hook back into the rocket once the bait is on i took my son fishing with them and what we ended up doing is not launching them out of the gun rod we left the pod open with the bait on the hook and dropped it into the water and let it drift with the current i ve come to find that buying cheesey little rods and reels are simply a waste of money if you re going to take a little one out fishing just use your own and let them reel yours in until their big enough to handle a decent set up the only reason i gave this stars is because it was a neat idea
0,turbotax has what looks like it would be a geat feature the ability to import data from your financial institutions so that you don t have to enter all of your stock sales by hand some of the cost basis how much i bought the shares for was empty so i had to go in and enter them manually no big deal just took a few minutes however when i went to e file the program had flagged these changes as overrides to computed values and refused to let me e file the return equally bad is that if i just leave the fields empty as they came from charles schwab then it looks like i got the stocks for free and have a huge tax bill that is incorrect so after many hours of trying to see if i could change the field so that it would not be flagged as an override i determined from other upset users of turbotax in the forums on intuit com that i was out of luck i d have to print it out and mail it in as a special reward turbotax doesn t even tell you what attachments you need to include on the return that you are now forced to mail in the help screen says that what it prints out will tell you what to include in the return that s wrong so the main reason i got turbotax was to e file now i get to print it out find out all of the crap that i have to attach to the return mail it in then wait for weeks to months to get my return thanks intuit the saddest part is that h r block had sent me a free copy of taxcut before i bought turbotax i should have used that before i spent on a piece of crap like turbotax won t do that again
0,i purchased this item per other recommendations and that of stereophile magazine thinking that this would be useful for broadcasting itunes and internet radio programming to other parts of my home first reception was terrible even with the reciever placed only a few feet away from the transmitter second i tried the tweak turning up the volume pot suggested in other ratings this didn t help matters from a reception standpoint in addition the unit is so poorly constructed that the mere act of opening it dislodges the volume potentiometer third the volume pot itself is of very poor construction in short it doesn t work you won t be happy even if you attempt to fix it yourself don t buy this product

1,this was by far the best genero kenzie novel of the series i loved this book everything about it in this one you really got to see the emotional side of bubba made him more likeable the storyline kept me riveted and not wanting to put the book down i was happy to see angie and patrick back together the ending was very good and left you thinking the character could possibly come back in a future book i m scratching my head wondering why this was the last book of the series and why lehane hasn t published another it s been years i will be watching for it
1,and secured their musical legacy the real thing was a solid rock rap mixture with newly hired mike patton providing vocals on angel dust patton had a lot more creative input providing his wonderful vocal stylings and schizophrenic persona to faith no more it s a joyous ride that after a less than stellar performance initially has become something of a cult classic and favorite among many newer acts and with good reason this album is all over the board land of sunshine reads like a list of fortune cookies which is the supposed inspiration while caffeine is an anthem for patton s drug of choice and one of fnm s most energetic recordings then there is the occaisonal oddball track showing patton s range and sense of fun like rv which is like a melancholic rant from the stereotypical figure you might find living in an rv not exactly bilboard material but fun adding to the record were the internal tensions of the band jim martin was having creative differences yet pumps out some of his best work here tensions may have fueld a more agressive record and fnm would never sound better than they do on this album it s the bands chemistry both good and bad that make this album work commercially this might have not been the hit the record company wanted but its legacy can still be heard today and it s still a great record to crank up for a drive barely showing its year old age
1,i bought this because as a kid my grandparents had one that i would play with constantly everytime i visited and at the age of was certain i could solve it i never did and eventually it broke and it wasn t until i was sitting at my work waiting for my computer to do something that i thought i needed something to do while i waited for my computer to unfreeze or for the network to come back online so i bought a rubiks cube figured that it was a good portable puzzle thats easy to store and is only one piece it came with a display stand so i keep it displayed next to my monitor and have co workers come by and scramble it hoping that i won t be able to put it back but i always have like i said its a puzzle but not with alot of pieces and its portable so if your taking the bus home you can kill time with it then put it back in your briefcase or backpack i love it and haven t gotten sick of it yet
1,i admit it i m addicted not to the heavy stuff but instead head over heels in love with audiobooks and they have found a friend in audiofile a truly wonderful magazine that informs addicts like me about the latest trends equipment books to hit the market the down is that it s only published every other month i voraciously read it both on line and the hardcover edition that arrives in my mailbox some other reviewer complains that the reviews are nothing more than recaps while they are short and to the point i disagree about the contents of the reviews they re exactly what i m looking for an overview of the book not an in detail new york times type review if i want to learn more i then check with amazon to see what others feel while i still purchase and read print books they ll never go out of style i have found audiobooks a great alternative to curling up with agatha christie and hopefully audiofile along with my newfound addiction to audiobooks will continue to prosper and grow it s good to be in on the ground floor
1,there are two good ways to tell what audience at which a woodworking magazine is aimed the first is the type of advertising and the second is how much skill do the projects expect you to have it is pretty clear right away that woodworker s journal server home woodworkers who are already of moderate skill the advertised big toys run in the to dollar range although there are a couple of high end combination machines in the adds as well articles expect you to know how to use the tools of the trade but not sure about the best way to do something a recent issue makes a study of an intarsia backed high chair with some interesting joinery and instructions for making a genuinely exotic angle jig for a table saw writing is solid and reasonably illustrated but they devote little space to what you should already know which can make these projects a stretch for a tyro the magazine is very tool oriented there isn t a lot of space devoted to hand tools or history expect articles comparing nail guns and helping you decide whether stationary or bench top equipment is right for you however traditionally manual tasks like finishing also receive their due i found the woodworker s journal suited me quite well and i expect to continue reading it

0,i can t beleive this guy s arrogance to try and re record songs that are essentially and always will be sinatra s domain any idiot will tell you that once sinatra got hold of a song it was and always will be identified with him fact ask tony bennett or any other great singers and they will tell you sinatra is the voice and then this upstart thinks he can do better not only does he murder a very good year but also attempts badly mr bojangles even attempting to ape sammy davis s mannerisms i had the misfortune to hear this once and came to the conclusion that is was a a joke or b a blantant attempt by williams to crossover to boarder appeal now i see it actually meant it robbie you will never be able to sing standards and please don t attempt the rodgers and hart songbook though i suspect you will if your latest album bombs your voice is flat most of the time and your attempts to look cool on the cover can t cover up your mediocrity the only time i d like to see you swing is from a lamppost stick with songs for swinging lovers come fly with me to hear the real thing an insult to classic songs

1,one of the best programs that i have to work with cd dvd
1,i guess i understand why this movie was so savagely criticized during it s year of release prince was still enjoying huge popularity based largely on the success of purple rain both the film and the soundtrack and critics love to knock someone off a pedestal which is what they did to prince in those days many claimed that the movie was nothing more than an ego trip they couldn t believe prince had the nerve to fire the director and then assume that role himself it was all way too harsh criticism for a movie that isn t trying to be anything more than a fun romantic comedy of course poor critical response alone doesn t usually keep the public from making a movie popular yet under the cherry moon was a bomb at he box office probably the main reason for this is that the movie although shot in color was released in black and white for some unfathomable reason the general movie going public is more often than not horrified at the prospect of seeing a black and white movie now don t get me wrong i m not claiming that had the movie been released in color that people would have flocked to it in droves i m only saying that it would have attracted more of an audience if it had been in color i will acknowledge that this movie s target audience is prince fans since i am one myself and have been most of my life i m not the most entirely objective viewer but i make no apologies for my love of this movie it s not a guilty pleasure for me because i proudly hold this as one of my favorites i had only seen it a couple times before the dvd release and unfotunately i missed it in theaters i couldn t get anyone to take me i was only and none of my friends were into p and certainly not my parents though my dad went with me a few years later to see grafitti bridge on opening night but that s for another review but since it s dvd release in this has become one of my most watched discs in my collection the soundtrack is killer the tunes make up one of the best prince albums ever there s even some great stuff heard in the movie that didn t make the album some of which was issued on vinyl plus i think the movie looks great the cinematographer was michael ballhaus who has multiple academy award nominations to his credit and was the dp on numerous martin scorsese classics i wonder how the movie would feel in color but i do think black and white was the right way to go even though the movie is set in then contemporary times it has the feel of something from the there are so many classic moments in this movie i won t try to list them all but here are a few christopher tracy prince giving his bela lugosi eyes tricky jerome benton tossing rose petals into the tub while christopher takes a bath christopher freaking out when he sees bats at the eatery the wreka stow scene the car race between christopher and mary sharon kristen scott thomas as for the acting i ve heard a lot of people saying that prince s performance was no good i don t see much truth in that claim after being so serious in purple rain it was a nice contrast to see him so loose and funny in this jerome benton proved he could do just fine even without morris day at his side as in purple rain i m surprised jerome hasn t done much additional acting outside of prince movies and obviously kristen scott thomas moved on from this her first major role to become an oscar nominated highly repected leading lady how is the dvd presentation pretty good for such a largely overlooked movie the widescreen transfer and stereo mix aren t anything phenomenal but get the job done nonetheless the movie looks and sounds fine as for features anyone expecting a full blown special edition like the disc purple rain will be disappointed but at least it s not a completely bare bones release four music videos are included though unfortunately not presented in optimal audio visual quality though they are passable i would ve preferred mixes the highlight is the live performance of anotherlover which was taken from a never released at least not domestically not sure if it saw the light of day anywhere outside the u s concert video documenting the parade tour mtv held an interesting i e very weird contest to determine where under the cherry moon would have it s world premiere the ten thousandth caller to an mtv hotline would accompany prince to the premiere which would be held in their hometown mtv ran a special that covered the premiere party and unlike the premiere of purple rain unfortunately this program is not to be found on under the cherry moon s dvd release lisa barber was the contest winner and the movie did indeed premiere in her hometown of sheridan wyoming a very unusual place for a big movie to premiere when asked what he thought of the town of sheridan prince summed it up with a single word purple
0,my husband and i have ignored many poor reviews in choosing toys for our month old and have often been pleasantly surprised to see our son thoroughly enjoying such toys unfortunately this was not the case with the peg perego thomas ride on train he is exceptionally tall and strong for his age yet there is no way his hand could possibly depress the button required to keep the train moving much less hold it down for any length of time so the operation of the train requires an adult to depress the button and spin in circles while your child bats your hand away and is totally distracted from the experience my son enjoys pushing the train along the track more than riding it however the train is flimsy and easily comes off the track so this usually lasts a few seconds before he is again frustrated and annoyed all this and then you need to get out the screwdriver to charge the battery every time you play with it don t buy this toy or you will be kicking yourselves like we are it s a gimmicky piece of plastic junk that even major thomas lovers will probably not enjoy

0,i have to be honest i bought in to all the hype of mineral make ups my sister uses the bare essentials and her skin looked flawless and she has uneven tones like i do i didn t want to pay the price or join the club so i tried pur minerals i still had to use a cover up under my eyes and blemishes and had to put pur minerals on rather heavy to get the flawless look but then it looked too powdery i started using my regular cover girl foundation and powder again as i felt it covered better and less heavy just a note my sister said she still uses a cover up stick when using bare essentials too but she looked beautiful in it

1,pros compact lightweight portability easy to use big screen good reproduction cons microphone sensitive to wind getting used to not having a viewfinder bad low light performance summary i picked this camera as an upgrade for my old canon the first reason i chose it was the small size and portability with a good light conditions this little beast do its best shots but in low light conditions this camera disapointed me specially compared with mi old please don t buy it if you have plans to use it for stills shots because it has a low resolution the included handycam station have all the ports firewire usb power video you need to conect it the big touch screen is a must because the screen is the only way to access the camera controls besides some of them in the edge of the screen you can have a camera with more characteristics and better image quality for the same price but if your concern is the size and portability this will be your best choice in the world of the mini dv format

0,my wife and i purchased the videonow xp interactive video system for my son this christmas however when we did walmart was out of the headphones well i was on amazon one day and decided to look here i ordered them and was seriously disappointed when they arrived my year old son attempted to put them on and all they did was fall to his shoulders no matter how we tried that is all they would do my year old daughter decided to try them with her player with the same result i am able to wear them however even with my year old head size it is still loose these are not adjustable which of course makes things all the worse i would just go ahead and pick up some other company s aftermarket headphones for your child if tiger reads the reviews of their products at all then they need to ensure that they rethink the engineering of this device

1,kate is one of the most talented musicians on this earth the dreaming was underrated when it was first released but i think that has to do with the fact that it was way ahead of its time this is a superb album tracks like sat in your lap suspended in gaffa leave it open night of the swallow houdini and get out of my house proving this point there s lots of anger on this album as kate put it herself many years ago and it is her darkest effort to date but it s pure brilliance buy it and be convinced
0,i love this film it s epic storytelling on a grand scale and timeless viewing i was thrilled to see it being released on dvd unfortunately it seems there was little if any restoration on the print used i have only viewed sections of the film so far but every frame i have seen has surface dirt or scratches in one section there are long scratches down the entire side of the picture i was so looking forward to seeing something close to a pristine print which is what a film of this calibre deserves i d have given stars if it had so the minus three is for the appaling print one of the worst i ve ever seen
1,i am very pleased with this product it is good quality easy to use and well worth the money
0,our family bought this tank and we went through plenty of goldfish with it we stopped buying when our year old was using the scope to look at the fish she was pulling it up and down and turning it and when she was finished she put it down and saw that she had put it down on the actual fish the fish was bleeding and died the kids were not very happy i guess this is an okay tank but not great you might want to put only beta s in it i would suggest getting something with a filter and heater if you want any other kind of fish
1,and now a word from david lynch as spoken by dean stockwell as doctor yueh in dune the tooth the tooooootttttttth remember the tooth seriously my daughter loves dora the explorer and my goals are to get her to brush her teeth for longer than two minutes i bought this dora the explorer battery powered electric toothbrush and she does game set match best money i ever spent on simultaneous child and parent satisfaction when i tested this model on my finger i was surprised at how powerful it was for a child sized unit this electric toothbrush decidedly will not rip her little gums off her skull but the teeth definitely get a good scrubbing battery life is okay i estimate it costs about a cent for her to brush her teeth each time the future value of that expenditure is far lower than the dental bills i d otherwise have so this is a money saving unit if your child in a member of the dora cultus this is one of the better items to own

0,to add on to the previous reviewers i was very disappointed with this camera s performance i compared the megapixel photos with photos taken with my canon powershot and the simply did not produce the same quality stills the camera itself also seemed flimsy the idea of having a two in one camera is so attractive but another attractive concept canon s offered a camcorder with a compact design in the end however it broke down only after a year and a half for a purchase that is not a durable lifespan cf reviews for and you will see that many are having hardware problems this camera seemed less durable than the as i maneuvered the various parts and dials of course i am returning the camera before it can prove its durability nevertheless maybe the folks at cnet can stake their money on it lastly i should add that the positioning of the record button and function dials are poorly placed i found that i had to use both hands when switching back and forth from camcorder to still cam modes as well as simply engaging the record button this definitely takes away from the idea of a convinient solution for capturing those special moments again this camera is a great idea but i suppose we should wait until the manufacturers make one that has both solid hardware and quality image recording this one is on the right track but still so far from accomplishing a quality product
1,these notebooks seem like a pricey investment but they re well worth it i use mine for meetings journaling and sketching out ideas not only is it sturdy enough to take a beating but it has a touch of class that a legal pad can t match

0,most annoying thing is that i hooked up through hdmi for of my components however this receiver requires you too also hook audio connections as well if using the hdmi i used optical what the hell is the deal with that at first i thought that maybe if you do that then the receiver wont have to be on to have sound output to your tv or something but nope no sound if the system is turned off as well hdmi is supposed to make it more convenient cable etc why is this necessary secondly my receiver is not working properly the sound output to the rear speakers is low volume and garbled of the time running the auto macc fails out manually i see that it outputs surround right speaker to the front right speaker nothing is hooked up to this output on the receiver so nothing should be outputting at all during this part surround left is silent as it should be occasionally the right rear speaker will blast out times louder then it supposed to be adjusting the volume takes it back down to the low garbled norm if i select the different output options basically pushing buttons for no reason sometimes the audio will be correct and does sound amazing i am current in process to return my faulty receiver for a replacement as i do think the receiver is nice if its working i enjoy the ipod dock that has output to your tv as well i major concern is something is wrong with there hdmi circuitry and causing my problems and the replacement will be bad as well i will update when i get the replacement installed

1,i am a college student and member of the army reserve with knowledge of manufacturing production processes i value pieces of fine engineering precision and design i have always admired automatic watches someday when i can afford one i will purchase an omega or rolex i can tell that in my particular watch there is a minute dust on the hour hand and on the pendulum first off this watch should be appreciated for what it is an automatic watch for a reasonable price there are no batteries no electronics just gears and springs some automatic kinetic whatever watches use a pendulum to charge a small battery these do not interest me pros automatic movement sharp visual appeal day date function supposed shock resistance haven t beat it up enough to know if this is true but i trust the claim having researched the manufacturing of the movement see thru case back so you can watch the mechanism do its thing cons it is not a rolex so don t expect perfection the band and case are solid but lack the heft fit and finish of a rolex level watch bottom line if you want a truly automatic watch for about bucks this is a great choice orient watches and other invicta models are supposedly are just as good you will get compliments on this watch
1,i have bought this set for a gift but also received it as a gift myself from my registry although my daughter is two and a half now i would recommend the playtex nursers to everyone they are sanitary and do cause less gas than conventional bottles i definitely like the drop ins liners better than the traditional ones from a convenience standpoint paired with the fact that they work so well with the breast milk storage system i m not planning on any more children but i don t dare part with these bottles yet they are stored in my basement for future use either my myself or family members they also helped make the transition from breast to bottle to sippy cup a breeze

1,a recent dallas morning news column profiling t d jakes quoted a university of houston sociology professor saying that jakes is incredible in how he s able to diagnose people s pain he has an uncanny ability to put a finger on the human condition jakes new book he motions illustrates the verity of the professor s statement in he motions jakes nails the issues and challenges christian men face today in trying to fulfill their many roles and pursue their dreams jakes writes from his heart and soul as a pastor father husband and entrepreneur in the opening pages he describes his motivation for writing i want to share what i ve learned i want to cut through so much of the junk imposed on men today and talk heart to heart about what it means to be a man not in some touchy feely group hug kind of way but in an honest soul bearing way which also respects men and honors the women who love them and whom they love jakes thoroughly succeeds in fulfilling his desire for this book not only does he address male readers but he also targets female readers who hope to gain insights about men jakes no holds barred writing offers refreshing candor for those wanting an honest assessment of who they are and where they are in life jakes writes about his childhood his ministry his family and his ups and downs in life always tying stories to life lessons for readers it does not take the reader long to discern that jakes possesses a vast breadth of wisdom and understanding about the inner workings of men in our culture jakes writes that a man must value himself he motions can help readers make great strides in finding value in themselves regardless of their circumstances he encourages men to refuse to become discouraged but to keep moving toward their destiny while simultaneously enjoying the splendid moments of life s journey the book is written as if jakes is in the room having a one on one talk with the reader if it was in fact such a talk it would surely involve laughing weeping praying and dreaming one such example of the conversational style is when jakes writes about balancing family and career he writes i m here to tell you that if you don t contain your work life and segregate it from your home life then your career will consume the marriage like a campfire blazing outside of its circle of rocks and roaring into a life threatening forest fire there is not an area of discussion where jakes lets men off the hook he writes authoritatively about power money and sex in the financial arena jakes commands readers stop asking god to bless an area where you refuse to obey his word for your life in one relationship area after another jakes writing leads the reader to self examination awareness forgiveness and improvement his writing on subjects such as a man s relationships with his father children wife other men time money and god is honest and down to earth it is also practical as are the questions for men and women at the end of each chapter throughout the book jakes references the life of david to shed light on the above relationships from a biblical perspective jakes encourages readers that someone needs to know who you are and where you are at all times in your walk and life this book could be an effective tool to use in a discussion or accountability group to help people grow stronger relationships i encourage men and women to take advantage of the wisdom and insights jakes shares in this book
1,the truth about cats and dogs is a thoroughly enjoyable refreshing movie janeane garofalo uses her bread and butter acting technique of playing a cynical depressed miserable pessimistic character who sees herself as an ugly duckling who no man could want of course she s not really acting that s really her lock stock and barrel the miserable pessimistic vicious act isn t an act at all the fly in the ointment to this movie is that uma thurman is not a knockout of course some men would prefer the tall thin blonde over the short brunette but the basis of the movie hinges on uma being the gorgeous woman and janeane being average but it doesn t work when you believe it s the other way around uma thurman has certainly looked good in some movies but she looks haggard here bottom line a good film about the ugly duckling getting the guy based on the classic cyrano de bergerac story just like roxanne starring steve martin
1,i own several canon lens for my and this is hands down the best i had a which was a very good lens regardless of some reviews and i got many excellent photos with it this is distinctly better in all ways of course it costs a lot more recently went with the grandchildred to sea world and i got good photos with several really outstanding ones it is light accurate and has is what more do you want you can replace a slew of lens with this one and perhaps selling the old ones will help pay for it bought it as soon as it was available and have not regretted it one moment if you have one lens this is the one

0,as a child i remember finding this magazine at my doctor s office and reading it because it was the only thing available it has not changed much there are no redeeming features to make up for the dated and patronizing content this magazine will neither stretch your child s mind nor keep him entertained it only teaches the child what he already knows and feeds him what he has already seen in the coming era of global connection children must become aware of other parts of the world and lifestyles alien to them only telling them what is already common in their everyday lives helps to foster racism and xenophobia

1,no way should children be playing this game it is for mature players as the subject matter could confuse younger players the goals of harming people picking up hookers breaking the law can be a blast as long as everyone knows it s just a fantasy many people go into the details so i ll make this short have a good time while pretending to be a bad guy who does unforgivable acts but there s no way i would consider this game for anyone under and then i would have to know that the teen can handle the fantasy

0,this has a run down of the colts season from game one to the super bowl thats it do not expect the super bowl without commercials and edited down because thats not what this is very disappointing the afc championship game of the week is just a post game show i would have loved to see at least the half of that game it was better then the super bowl the only good things where the few extras with manning and harrison wired for sound i hope there is a better one come n cause this is not worth much
0,this product offers much to chose from and i really liked the photos however i have yet to get this program to work right i am able to view the photos but when i go into the the export wizard to save the photos the photo has a transparency over the top of it instead of in the background i tried bypassing the export wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving this also inserts the transparency over the photo i called hemera in canada and they instructed me to call encore usa in ca for support encore usa said they couldn t help me encore s technical support is limited to crashes error messages and lockups i also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or faq s there was very little about this software and no help to be found i wasted my money on a product i can t use and that offers no support for issues out of my control
1,it is impossible to go back to regular coffee after you drink this stuff my husband drinks kona every day and i have gotten several friends hooked on it i highly recomend this product and company the kona island coffee company is great they always get the coffee out quick and if there is ever anything wrong the will work with you to fix it
0,i ve had this battery for half a year and i agree with a fellow reviewer s assessment that the battery does not hold much power i am diligent about expending all energy before recharging because they have memory but this delkin model s life span was noticeably short now i am going to buy a new charger battery altogether because i don t want to buy another delkin battery
0,while it may have been well written this book is disturbing and disgusting to put it mildly if you or anyone you know are pregnant or contemplating or trying to have children do not read this book this is one book i can honestly say in retrospect i would rather have failed the test on than ever have read
1,all things aside the other kid in the movie the caddie friend that has the episode at the end stated this way without ruining the ending played a great part as a supporting actor his name is justin goncalves i think this kid was very believable in every aspect of the part he played in fact i think he stole the scenes when he was onscreen with the gamble kid believability is important and this kid carried his weight the entire movie for what limited scenes he had i was particularly impressed with the part he played
1,i ve always liked this candy but i couldn t find them anywhere in stores near me so i ordered a case
1,a local news station in our area aires a commentary piece that ask the question does it really do that as it relate to product advertisements a news team member goes out to investigate the product to determine whether or not it really does do what it s advertised to do then the reality of the item is disclosed durig the commentary well news team if you re listening save your time and money take it from me the lacross atomic clock really does do that all that it s advertised to do and more three things that i particularly enjoy the fact that it automatically sets itself according to the time zone the numbers white are boldly displayed and help you to accurately read the time from a distance and that it s precise in maintaining the time donald r greer very satisfied lacross atomic analog clock

1,this is a very good looking watch it goes with dressy or casual and it makes you feel well dressed
1,i got a bunch of these and they work perfectly enjoy
0,this product will only display photos no matter how many you may be able to squeeze onto a media card this little fact isn t mentioned at all on the packaging or in the manual hidden from consumer i initially loaded photos onto a card and was shocked to only see displayed a firmware upgrade is offered from the manufacturer on their website to increase this number to but i could never get the file to load into the frame another annoying aspect was that the slideshow plays the photos in the same order everytime you start it along with the same music it would have been nice to hear a random music track start each time the frame is turned on and see some of the later photos instead of having to watch the same photos play in the same order each time you turn the frame back on definitely not worth the price shell out a couple more bucks for something that supports unlimited photos and allows random playback
1,in general this program worked very well i ve had a hard time putting my new dual core pentium d computer in the raid configuration so i bought this instead the clone function works extremely well and is an adequate alternative to the raid configuration but i was a bit confused about how to use the incremental backup function the initial backup went well but when i went back for incremental backup additions it would tell me it was impossible so i just clone the c drive every few weeks now i have two seagate gb sata hard drives and it s great to know that i have an exact copy of the c drive if i fry it i live in ethiopia so the power fluctuations are frequent and disastorous i ve already lost one hard drive to power flux abnormalities i d buy this product again and it s comforting to know that it s on my system and that i can back up my valuable data easily and quickly when i need to
1,i don t know why nobody else likes this product but so far it s the only one that works for my ingrown facial hairs yes it stings a bit when i put it on but it quickly goes away it doesn t dry my skin out it actually helps get rid of the dry white looking flaky skin after i shave i used to get ingrown hairs so bad on my face that they would be there for months eventually i d get to the point of having to do my own surgery with a needle to try and extract the hair if i get an ingrown hair now i just use tend skin once in the morning and once before bed and it actually extracts the hair on it s own it gets rid of the redness and swelling also associated with ingrown hairs for the only time in my life my face actually looks clear and tend skin is the product that has done it for me before i finish i d just like to add that i m the kind of person that nothing ever works on any product i try never does as advertised whether it be shampoo deodorant medication etc tend skin is one of the rarities that actually does work for me and believe me i ve tried a lot of products for ingrown hairs

1,those who write well have more power and therefore have more control over their lives p if this is indeed true then mem fox is a very powerful woman in the midst of the phonics vs whole language war being raged in the media this book is a call for reading and writing teachers to examine their practices and strive for truly purposeful artful teaching fox s insights into her life as a writer teacher and mother make this a truly inspiring and intensely challenging read i have always believed that to be an effective reading teacher i must be a reader able to share my passion for books with my students but mem fox points out that unless i am a writer as well i will be unable to know the difficulties fears hopes and needs of my students as writers i plan to thoughtfully explore the forms of writing i use examine the writing process i go through and share my writing with my students on a more regular basis i am convinced that we will all grow from the experience

0,these shoes are cute but not practical at all i generally wear high heals inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes i have ever tried on i ordered these and the peep toe sling back version these are really narrow in the two my foot feels so constricted in there they totally cut off your circulation and forget about even trying to walk in these very poorly constructed the peepttoe slings however are great fit true to size and are comfortable
1,i love this product i have month old twins that were born weeks early i swaddled them in receiving blankets when they came home from the nicu and they loved sleeping that way i stopped swaddling them at months because i could see they no longer liked it my night nurse told me to continue to swaddle them at night for up to a year she said it would help them sleep through the night i bought this product and while my girl and boy twins didn t like it at first they do go to sleep faster and stay asleep longer when they are wearing them not long after i started using this product my son slept from to what a dream he is getting better at getting at least one arm out but even when he does he still sleeps better then when he is not swaddled at all i have found that it works better when i put them in it when they are drowsy because then they don t lay in their crib trying to get out of it before they fall asleep we don t use them during the day now i will always give this as a baby gift going forward
1,when i first discovered this book in a london bookshop i decided at once that i needed to own it it s large it s bulky but it s beautiful it needs the large pages to illustrate the finest examples of tom s works as an artist myself who learnt a lot from tom s unique techniques i appreciate what a fantastic collection of art both colour and black and white has been compiled into this collection but it s not just pictures there s an insight into the man himself a delightful tribute to the master of homoerotic art this volume is a great tribute to tom and a valuable tool for the new breed of erotic artists like myself waiting for recognition
0,i am a gigantic james brown fan i have albums singles i ve met him times seen him live over times since had lunch with him in nyc and i am the paul in the jb section of gerri hirshey s nice history of soul music nowhere to run but if this book was written by james brown or if he even had much to tell the writer i ll eat my refrigerator it is so full of errors that it is laughable one of the most glaring errors was when mr brown supposedly said say it loud was where funk started or something to that effect that is so ridiculous james brown would never say such a thing any student of funk knows that cold sweat was the quintessentional funk piece and it is not even mentioned in the book the style of mr brown s sentences that are attributed to him sound nothing like him i have no idea why this was put out the other autobiography written over a decade ago was more relevent and much better written the godfather of soul by jb and bruce tucker someone alan leeds needs to write a page comprehensive biography of mr brown with much more detail
1,i have wanted to buy a musini for my son for a few years now but never found one in a retail store online or local i recently gave in and bought one gently used on ebay for a fantastic price including the cartridge my entire family loves it including my year old son it was very easy to figure out how to use even without a manual on the battery case are very clear easy to follow instructions on how to calibrate the sensitivity of your musini within minutes we had found the perfect setting for our carpeted living room and we were all dancing even my parents who came to visit one night were bopping to the musini my dad couldn t keep his feet still insisting on drumming them on the floor constantly to keep the music going when my toddler had taken a seat to rest for a minute i have found myself taking it out during my son s nap time to put near me while i do the mundane chores around the house it is really addicting and keeps us all moving i can t say enough good things about this toy the music quality is absolutely wonderful and is clear and crisp and a joy to listen to you also tend to feel like you are actually playing an instrument when you re dancing around or even sitting on the floor tapping your fingers the songs are mostly familiar and well loved songs that you will instantly recognize i have also noticed that you can use the musini to up your child s physical activity if you change the sensitivity so that they must jump or stomp hard you suddenly have an even greater outlet for energy and a great source of exercise you can of course adjust the sensitivity so that a single finger tap across the room will register it s up to you and i think it s fantastic highly recommended
0,i eagerly snapped up this ionic hair dryer about over a year ago because of it s retractable cord and folding capabilities even the price was attractive it really did take up little room in my bathroom drawer and the retractable cord was a plus i thought i had the perfect blow dryer because it did what it was supposed to do and quickly now for the bad news the retractable cord became chewed up and frayed after daily use and it became apparent that the cord was ultimately going to fray completely in due time then the folding handle low and behold broke in half one morning of course the warranty had long expired this dryer is too fragile to consider using on a daily basis and i consider myself a careful person when it comes to handling small appliances such as hair dryers when i ve replaced hair dryers in the past it was been because they ve simply reached the end of their lifespans and burned out i d caution anyone to consider this before buying because these features alone while very appealing can shorten an otherwise good hairdryer s lifespan i ve now purchased a tourmaline a featherweight quiet hairdryer with no retractable cord or folding handle which seems to work just fine and appears to have a much longer lifespan
1,i am a faithful csi watcher and have been since the shows inception i buy the dvd sets and enjoy them tremendously however there are two trends i see developing that i don t care for one there is too much catherine we know everything about her kid her dead husband her crook father etc and she s really an annoying character she makes nasty comments about everyone she s always being insubordinate she goes out with men half her age let s quit trying to make her seem like a young chick when she isn t especially wearing those skin tight jeans she is very arrogant and even though she continually screws up loses her camera blows up the lab in a previous season accuses people before she has all the evidence they made her a supervisor also the plot line with grissom and sara while predictable is not the greatest i think grissom would be better off paired with lady heather there s an idea let s see more of lady heather still even with the annoying overabundance of the least likable character catherine the show is one of the best if not the best on tv up there with without a trace ncis and numbers keep em coming
1,i agree it s a waste to get sizes you don t need here s an idea to do a public exchange i do not need the large and medium and will be glad to give to anyone just for the postage i just need the small sizes
1,it s fair to say that all orchestras are not created or built equally and these discs of phenomenal playing with the berlin philharmonic under the baton of herbert von karajan are simply some of the best classical recordings ever made analog sound was at its peak when these records were made in and and dg has done an excellent job of remastering them for cd but beyond that karajan simply gets the composer as another reviewer pointed out and conducts with an intensity and passion he seldom showed in his other recordings and performances i m listening to these discs once more on a massive sound system with doubled speakers to handle the kenwood beast amplifier and love it more than ever as a reviewer once said of a classic szell cleveland performance of beethoven s third this is a reading of blinding virtuosity and strength as a budget two disc set it is also incredibly enough cheaper than those old dg import records we bought and scratched up one by one in the seventies as i ve said before when you listen to a disc like this you realize why you went nuts for this kind of music in the first place buy it blast it love it get your slavic ya yas out
1,i gotta be honest when i first listened to this album i was dissapointed but like any truly amazing album it just took some decoding listening to the songs multiple times reaaaallly helps to appreciate what these guys are doing essentially gat are four people who are amazing at what they do and we should feel lucky that they have found a way to mesh together perfectly their first album emphasizer blew me away but i felt it lost steam around halfway through this album does no such thing and what is more impressive is that this is an all acoustic album which means skerik is using the natural sound of his sax as opposed to the various effects that he is known for this gives the album a much more natural feel and it shows that these four are able to make amazing music without any wizardry in the production department but dont get me wrong this cd sounds amazing anyway i saw them live last night in nyc and they blew my mind i recommend this cd to anyone and see them live if you get the rare opportunity
1,we purchased eight of these in and in for our beauty salon in and we ve never used another brand since with their quick heat up time and multi level heat options these irons perform superbly for precision curls i was so pleased their performance that i bought one to use at home to replace my fancy vidal sassoon gold barrel which only had two heat settings too hot and burnt scalp the heating element is so efficient that level or is probably sufficient for most home users rarely did i have to set the iron at level or and never above it takes less than a minute for the iron to heat up four of the six irons we originally purchased lasted through years of constant professional use at the price we paid our weekly cost averaged out to pennies if you purchase this product you will not be disappointed
1,i ve been waiting for this movie to come out on dvd to ad to my collection again if you like bill murray you ll like this movie also randy quaid is hilarious murphys law at it s best cracks me up just thinking about it
1,i finally found out this was out on dvd after having the vhs version for many years the dvd edit is very close to the vhs version minus the glitch during the scorpions opening act plus some video strobing added during cindy lauper s run down the runway which i m not sure was really needed but i m ok with it although the video strobing was done again later which seems to me as a cheap effect that really doesn t add to the performance i think brian adams and cindy was excellent for the parts they portraid i thought originally sinaed sp whatever was a strange choice at the time maybe good for the part but after seeing the documentary i see her being a good intention decision at the time that ended up biting them in the end she s too instable and apparently did not realize the importance of such an event nor did she show any respect for the part speaking of which all of those artists that were called to perform at this event and didn t say yes on the first call shame on you if roger calls you for an event you say yes and put whatever you re doing aside because this was way too big of an event to try to be politically correct with i wish there were more documentary material with this dvd as this was such a big event there should have been more information i had heard in an interview before the show that roger was once asked if he d ever do the wall again and he basically said if the berlin wall would ever come down then i would consider doing it again and this was never mentioned in the doc buy the video even if you have the vhs you ll enjoy it still waiting for pulse to be released as well enjoy
1,i am so satisfied with this trendmicro security system that i highly recommend it to everyone without mentioning my previous system this is tops i have never felt so secure before getting this system thank you for being able to supply me with it i hope through word of mouth and mail that i have caused others to go for it i do know of people at least who are changing thank you again

1,if you are expecting a huge chiminea then move on but if you want a medium sized one that is easy to assemble and good looking then this is the item for you it took about minutes to put together with two people and i am not mechanically inclined and it feels very solid not flimsy or cheap it is probably about lbs i used one half of a duraflame fake fire log in this chiminea the first time i used it and i was glad i did the burning area is kind of small and if i had used a full log i would have had an inferno even with the small log the flames lept out of the unit a bit so keep it away from anything flammable maybe regular wood sticks would work better i don t know i have yet to try that overall i am happy with the item because it is a nice convenient size works well and looks very nice
0,okay so to catch up on this exciting new series i decided to try this revolutionary downloading program amazon unbox i selected the first episodes and hit purchase minutes later i was watching the first episode it came quickly sounded great and looked wonderful however the second one was missing a few minutes at the end forgiveable until whole episodes starting arriving incomplete or had missing video making it incredibly frustrating and disappointing but this is a good concept unfortunately amazon has yet to verify all their own files for both audio and picture quality so until the issue is fixed and paying customers recieve completed files or refunds do not try and download season episodes and and were the only ones that were complete for me

1,i purchased this dehumidifier to tackle my overly humid house i live in california but my house is naturally very humid around on average the humidity frequently gets up to around and above in the winter as verified with a hygrometer mold was fast becoming a problem i have used this dehumidifier for over two weeks now and it is scary how well it works i placed it in the bedroom were the hummidity was at it s highest and it lowered my room from to in less than three hours it has a quiet fan that i have no problem sleeping with the tank is easy to empty and it is light enough to move from room to room i have not owned any other dehumidifiers before so i have no basis of comparison but i am in love with this one it was completely worth the price
0,i bought the dvd hoping to see one skit the funniest one my family had ever seen on snl we had it recorded on vhs many many years ago and somehow lost it but we would sit and laugh until we cried watching the skit where phil played the drill sargeant who came up with nicknames for his new recruits smiling laughing joking around man man who reminds me of my doggie hair head i thought for sure that the funniest skit in all of snl history would be on there but no it was just a second clip i was so disappointed and it was quite surprising to see some of the skits they chose to show in their entirety they just weren t funny on a positive note there was a serious song and dance number at the very end of the dvd that was so sweet it brought me to tears and the bonus featuring phil s audition was quite interesting but overall i don t recommend it
0,from reading the other reviews i seem to be one of the few to have mechanical issues with my within a month after buying it the lens cover began remaining half closed when the power is turned on i have to manually flick open the shutter cover then the flash began intermittently malfunctioning and now the zoom function will only work in one direction that is it works to zoom in on something to zoom back out i have to turn the camera off and back on to my knowledge the camera has not been dropped or otherwise physically abused to cause these problems i m disappointed because i do like the photos that the camera takes when it does function properly fortunately i bought it at costco so it s going back
0,whoever made this film is obviously trying to impress upon the viewer the idea that artists are deep complex people but all i see in the film are low life drug addict losers who sit around few of them seem to have jobs and party all day the main character sid is a pseudointellectual who claims she majored in critical theory in college ultra liberal nonsense which has the goal of undermining western culture to pave the pathway for marxism the film appeals to naive youth
1,the product description calls the orangettes belgian vitamin c except for the luxury price i m sure belgians must be pretty healthy with these around they re amazing the combination of orange peel and chocolate has long been popular but leonidas does it very well the dark chocolate is very rich not bitter and completely covers the orange peel which retains a good flavor and isn t overly sweet unlike other chocolatiers who often dip the peel only partially leonidas has made certain to put their chocolate center stage by using a generous portion the result is an addictive treat because the flavors linger on the palate and the orangettes aren t so sweet as to become cloying i don t know if these guys are really going to improve your health but they will definitely improve your day in my opinion they re worth the money as an occasional purchase and certainly worth a one time try the packaging is a gold box wrapped in blue and white leonidas paper with a gilt deep purple box for shipping the package was placed inside a sturdy styrofoam shell mine arrived within three days and looked like i d purchased them at the store to give as a gift

1,eyewitnesses are given too much credibility and are notoriously inaccurate conspiracy buffs have fashioned an industry out of events told and retold but this footage is the best witness it is also horrific to watch i had heard the parkland surgeons all talk about a head wound behind the president s right ear they should know they were there right the film shows otherwise if there is a conspiracy it is a well kept secret show me someone who can keep a secret if the us government is hiding evidence why is this footage available no one can tell where a shot came from by the target s movement the answer to where jfk s missing brain is here the third shot pulverized it turning it into a red mist had this film never existed the conspiracy people would have made millions more but the answers to their questions are in this footage this is history which cannot be retold by bad historians or knuckleheads see for yourself

0,i unpacked this warmer which we received as a gift did not use one with our first child i got as far as filling the removable reservoir with water before i decided to return it you literally fill a plastic reservoir with water and turn it upside down so that the lid to the reservoir which slides on has no rubber seal or other watertight implements can leak everywhere judging by the other comments i m glad it leaked before i had a chance to use it and burn up a box of wipes

1,basie s best players come to duke s place the columbia records street studios in and face ellington s finest not a battle but not quite a merger either since the count s contingent is heard in one speaker and their hosts in another channel there s more than an hour of good music on here laid down in the dying days of big jazz touring orchestras popular tastes had changed and the costs of keeping large groups of players together were impossible this is one of those rare cd s in which the booklet is almost as good as the music this one reveals that during this hour late afternoon to early morning session one of ellington s long time employees quit the group forever because the boss would not take his side in a fight with a colleague also interesting is the dispute over the title and cover graphics basie hated columbia s first idea to bill the date as a competition and his agent even destroyed the only copy of the original cover art the end result is an album whose sales over years have been hurt because no one knows its name the cover finally chosen says the count meets the duke but in larger letters it declares first time and then adds great orchestras and finally states duke ellington and count basie the label columbia sony put on the disc itself for this reissue says duke ellington meets count basie which makes no sense because they had known each other since the s if you already like both orchestras you ll want to own this late career session if you want an introduction to each group in its waning years the cd serves nicely for that too this disc really jives so don t be expecting any ballads here
1,overall i think this is a very good book for someone who is trying to turn their health habits around but is overwhelmed by all of the possibilities it also a good track to run on for someone who wants to implement important life changes in an easy step wise fashion there is nothing fanatical about the recommendations and they can be easily implemented by almost anyone one of the things i most like about this book is the encouraging tone and the prioritization of various changes that are made little by little in eating habits exercise etc this book recommends walking as the main source of exercise and gives some great arguments for why this makes sense i think there are also some good and simple nutritional guidelines e g eliminated trans fatty acids eating more fiber using more olive oil etc mixed in with some well researched conclusions are dr weil s opinions for example he recommends a fairly simple supplementation regimen while it is true that not everything he says is necessarily supported by corresponding studies it is also probably that some of it is on the mark but the data is not all in or all of the variables are not possible to isolate at the least i don t see where this level of supplementation would do harm to most people i also like that dr weil takes a holistic approach to health he not only looks at and talks about the body he also addressed stress and relaxation life attitudes and other ingredients of a healthy life that impact on health while he is very commercial he is also a harvard trained physician and i do think that he has some very good insights to share while in some ways i think this book can be better i would still recommend it to almost anyone especially people who are intimidated by the idea of exercising and changing their life habits while not every suggestion might be on target i am sure that if someone implemented all the suggestions over eight weeks they would undergo a big positive change in the state of their health i have certainly found this to be true and i cheat on some of them
0,i was very excited to get these earrrings for my daughter for christmas however upon opening found that one of the front of the earrings was dented now i need to return them other than the dent they were cute even though they were only there should be some quality control by the manufacturer

0,nelly could make the wort rapper sound like a lyricyst and how dare him to diss krs one he just said the truth and he really did not diss him on number he just added to why he sucks lets face it all his songs are basically dumb and and really don t have much texture involved and how funny is it that his friends really have no skill and they are all over this album it is just laughable if you buy this album you throw away good money unless you like bubblegum rap this is more for a teen white girl who wants to be cool but lets face it its played out
1,just received this massager and my wife and i can t stop massaging each other with it especially great deal for the special amazon price i ve been wanting one of these for years because i can hardly feel those little hand held ones that just fit in the palm of your hand glad i splurged only problem is that amazon site says heads item description says heads and actul product only included heads the one missing from the picture on the box is the acu point heads i m guessing that s why it s on sale still worth it if you get it on sale great massager
1,i received this very quickly i couldn t believe i could get the actual namebrand at such a great price very pleased
0,it has been a long time since i read the novel upon which this book is based but i do clearly remember it making sense this movie doesn t even make sense to quote a chicken i know marlon brando somnambulizes his way through the film and instead of coming off as sinister menacing and dominating he makes dr moreau into a joke val kilmer s portrayal is vacuous and silly is the character supposed to be under the influence i guess he wanted it portrayed that way the script is there one moreau talks about having almost reached his goal where his one son and his daughter do have some fine traits but both are also pretty ineffectual several reviews have mentioned the special effects i actually saw very few special effects the rat people on the boat were creepy and well done and some of the characters did make some superhuman moves but mostly i saw people in very elaborate well done costumes using well distorted voices the central character played by david thewlis should have been the focus of the movie as he is the narrator he kept getting lost in the shuffle and i kept waiting for him to see things that i saw and to ask the questions that i would have asked i like him as an actor but this is certainly not a memorably good performance it is somewhat ironic that he is the witness to animal human hybrid horror here but is the werewolf in harry potter and the prisoner of azkaban the film does create a sense of the nightmare several of the characters do show glimpses of depth and genuineness most notably ron perlman s preacher but then he s well practiced from his beauty and the beast television series that was what barely earned this film its second star let s vote them all off the island and start over robert duvall as moreau replace kilmer with matt damon casey affleck replacing david thewlis
0,this was given to us as a present but i would have never bought it for myself here are the problems we have a platform bed and you cannot shorten the height so it was worthless as a cosleeper we still tried to use it as a bassinet but the mattress is so thin and uncomfortable our daughter would cry when you put her in it i tried to put extra padding which worked ok but still not great once she was bigger it would have been nice if this converted to a deeper thing like a pack and play to use in the living room but the bassinet part is fixed i would have been happier with a regular pack and play which had a removable bassinet ultimately we happily gave it away after about months
0,i would give this toy a if it was an option when you unfold the tiny track and get the train going it can t even make one corner turn without coming off the track the train is too big for the sharp corners and it either sticks or completey comes off the track this is very frustrating for my kids and i cannot believe they even put this on the market you can t even get it to stay in the track when you manually push it i am just bummed that we threw away the box before we put in batteries and saw how bad this toy really is we wanted this toy for portability our kids also have the geotrax working railway which is awesome but not as portable

0,michael moore filmed this propaganda partially financed by the united auto workers to distract attention from the real reason gm was forced to shutter plants the japanese auto invasion made possible by gm s unhealthy cost structure the company was burdened with exorbitant uaw wages something union friendly michael moore does his best to conceal so roger smith becomes the reason for the plant closings years of losses at gm have shown moore s twisted arguments to be exactly what they were then phoney uaw sponsored lies to shift attention away from the primary role played by the uaw in the death spiral of the automakers moore and others pretend gm management had dropped the ball but gm lost tens of thousands of engineers and salaried staff let go long before any unionized line workers felt any pain all of gm s problems are the result of the lack of profits resulting from the uaw albatross slow redesign cycles lack of money for research you name it moore will never mention how the uaw has screwed the consumers for the past years and how now that consumers have a choice they find the better value in asian autos nobody wants to pay a uaw worker to bolt on a fender while making more than their family doctor the uaw has fixed labor prices for long enough enough is enough and moore is shown to be the stooge of the unions with this preposterous piece of slanted fiction he laughingly calls a documentary
1,i have used medela s pump in style advance for months now after having my first baby this pump is the best in its class and it is the best thing i bought in why i gave this item star ratings it helped me to establish a steady milkflow from the week of breastfeeding i am a working mom and had only weeks off from delivery till i have to get back to work again so it was important for me to rely on a good breast pump to keep the supply going this pump is comfortable to use and i can regulate the speed which is suitable for me the medela parts are easy to set up for usage and also easy to wash sterilise it never breakdown ever for months now and i m pumping times a day i bring this unit to the office and also whenever i am travelling it is very mobile although a little heavy to carry it has a battery pack which is handy whenever i am in a place without power supply i bought this online in amazon for usd but in malaysia this unit would have cost usd just a note for non us users like myself you need to get an adapter which is compatible with this pump this can be easily obtained from any electrical shops this is a good buy if you re looking for a pump then you have found it
1,great stuff but keep a sugar free soda or low carb beer handy because you will need em
0,to get hot lather which is nice you first have to get the device installed on top the can i would not recommend this if you are easily frustrated the directions provided are sparse in several languages first you have to pry the top off the can of shaving cream they provide a pry tool for that purpose which works well on some brands of shaving cream better than others then you have to fit the device on top the can it worked well with one brand in a large size can when i tried it with a smaller size can of shaving cream it emptied half the can during the installation process using a different brand in a large can i had trouble prying the top off the can if you have time and patience and are willing to spend some money on various brands of shaving cream to find one that works well give it a try otherwise be forewarned it may lead to frustration and bad language it would be nice if companies intending to sell products in the us apparently manufactured somewhere in asia would provide a clear set of instuctions in english in reasonable large readable type with illustrations in this case they need to clearly specify the type shaving cream can the unit is designed for i do not need instructions in foreign languages and get tired of limited instructions in six languages
1,this pony has proved along with the princess promenade to be one of the most popular of the my little pony s we have bought it comes with a pink skirt a pink crown and high heel shoes the most popular item was the dressing table with revolving mirror and after several months it still hasn t broken despite harsh treatemnt the pony is white with silver strands through the mane and tail it was very pretty but the rough treatment really does make the mane matted very quickly also think about getting white pony s very seriously for younger children while the coloured ones can be drawn on with pen and the stains wiped off and at least partly concealed on white ponys it is impossible to hide for the younger ones year olds it is hard to get them not to at first desert rose was very pretty but is now a bit stained and sorry looking never the less she is integral in my children s games still which is nice one of the more popular ponies we have bought generally very hard wearing including the accessories the only item which has been broken is the crown which didn t last it was too thin and got badly bent early on

0,don t buy if you plan on printing often runs out very very fast
0,this makes no sense if the industry standard is why did they kodak cut the paper to and then advertise on the carton that it is yes i see the fine print on the back side of the carton that reads actual paper size is i still don t understand why they did this now i have cut the pictures down to the correct size what a waste of my time

1,i really enjoyed this game yes it is not perfect but it is definitely worth the price of the game if you re looking for escape back to the old west then this is your game as many of the reviewers have mentioned there are some flaws in the game if you can get past them then i am positive you will enjoy the game the horse riding is fun but i also found myself enjoying the plot it plays like a movie the cut scenes are great fun to watch and are well voice acted the graphics are detailed as well i found that the artists took their time in modeling the weaponry of the era and it likely very historically accurate a big plus if you have ever wanted to be the star of a western this is your chance if you like tv shows and movies such as gunsmoke deadwood and once upon a time in the west you ll probably wonder where this game has been i did
0,i love the history channel have infinite respect for the avg love john wayne films and lived two years in the part of china where flying tigers is set so you d think i might adore this film i had hoped so but unfortunately republic pictures made this opus on the cheap john wayne plays a fictional commander of the american volunteer group somewhere between claire chennault and pappy boygnton he does his best to carry the film and does ok but he can t carry it alone bad effects cheap stock footage flimsy sets and bad script all plague tigers republic made little effort to hide the california filming location and even used the wrong planes there is little mention of the oss avg connection and the film was made too early on to be a good history of the avg even if it were accurate the heroes of the avg deserve better than tigers this film isn t a tribute to them it s a sloppy propaganda film that does them little service

1,shavers fall into two categories those who prefer rotaries like the norelco and those who prefer foil shavers for those of you who like foil shavers this is the one for you i ve owned the latest braun and it was excellent while it lasted the charger kept breaking on me once in the first month then another time months later it was expensive and the refills were a pain pricey but they worked after two exchanges i decided to try the norelco speed xl rotaries and while they shaved really close they tore up my neck the problem only got worse returned weeks later i just got the panasonic and can say that it definitely shaves closer than both of the tried razors they shave much faster than the braun and norelcos i m not sure if i like the side to side pivoting head only time will tell the heads don t pivot up and down as much as the braun but once again time will tell if this is necessary one major advantage is that it cleans with soap and water no expensive refills to hassle over the panasonic has two noticeable downsides it s louder than other shavers but who cares it shaves incredibly fast anyway you can t plug it in and shave you have to wait until the battery is charged and charger is disconnected to turn it on this is my favorite razor by far

1,i ve decided to buy this collection after a reading a lot of reviews from different websites but none of them are very clear about the contents of the package so here is the contents of the package icewind dale cd s icewind dale expansion heart of winter icewind dale ii cd s icewind dale soundtrack icewind dale ii bonus disk icewind dale strategy guides trailer of iwd ii this package is well worth the purchase u get a series of one of the best selling game developed by pioneers who have also developed games like fallout series abd the graphics are great they look bright and crisp the soundtrack is great and suits well with the ambience u really feel the snow falling and the cold weather the gameplay is fun it is more like a hack n slash game i m a greatest fan of diablo series so i love this game as well to put it in a nut shell this game is hack n slash with d d rules if u like diablo u will certainly like this baldurs gate fans will slightly get disappointed with the game play charecter creation is great this game allows dual class charecters so it adds more fun to gameplay my only complaint is there is no interation within r party members but this doesn t affect the gameplay experience overall if u ever have a thought of getting this game and don t know whether its worth the money the answer is plainly a best value for r money
0,i purchased this item to keep my wife warm and cozy for the hour flight to japan however it was way too thin to keep her warm after using it for about an hour we ended up packing it back to the case and use the blanket given to us by the airline since i spent over dollars on this blanket i couldn t even throw this away i had to haul it around for the entire trip i do not think it is worth dollars dollars blanket would do the same or even better job than this

0,i have used taxcut and turbotax on and off for years turbotax tends to have less problems this year taxcut was incredibly difficult first it would not properly import the data from deductionpro then the tier one tech support gave me outright incorrect information finally tier two support gave me the link to the custom patch that allowed me to import the data also when i received the taxcut email that the irs had accepted my return i logged on to taxcut to check status and get my declaration control number taxcut would not recognize that i had efiled and would not check for the dcn i had to call support for about the time and after some time on the phone they discovered they could access the dcn and gave it to me over the phone because of these delays i have still not finished with the state return i don t know if i will buy this product again
1,back when blondie was being hailed as the biggest new wave band in pop music by fans and critics alike there were also just as many critics that quickly dismissed blondie as bubblegum pop and one group that would never have staying power but i think it s been observed enough how the group has had the last laugh parallel lines helped establish blondie as a serious music group and turned their cult following into commercial success this album is also the first where debbie harry s voice gets sharpened with the sensibility of a sweet vulnerable girl one minute to sultry and rapturous behind disco grooves the next the album made punk pop and disco shake hands which was a method unheard of in songs like hanging on the telephone picture this pretty baby and sunday girl have become irresitable pop gems while i know but i don t know and fade away radiate featuring a terrific guitar lick by robert fripp are punk driven classics last but not least are the two hits that are forever getting played on the classic rock stations of today in one way or another and heart of glass and how has debbie harry played out as lead singer after all these years as rolling stone stated when this album was ranked on their list of the greatest albums of all time madonna was surely watching

1,the previous review is not completely correct the problem is not with the product but with the description what amazon com put up for the canon cpm battery magazine it is a battery magazine for the canon compact battery pack cp and not for the camera battery grip i think the product itself is a great thing it lets you switch the whole magazine with preloaded batteries instead replacing the batteries in the canon compact battery pack cp the previous reviewer should not judge a product by the incorrect infromation given by a retailer

0,as a frequent visitor to the himalayas and being closely in touch with both tibetans ordinary folks not the tortured ones and the chinese i find this documentary interesting but terribly one sided i have not met a single wealthy tibetan in nepal or india who can swear to me that he will return to a freed tibet run by their government in exile to be fair to the experts a lot of the evidence of chinese violence against the tibetans is real i sincerely feel sorry for them and wish that they could somehow be compensated however the documentary gets emotive and it seems bent on presenting the situation in tibet entirely from the viewpoint of the activists and other victims of chinese aggression while it is true that many tibetans suffered and died during the invasion and subsequent crushing of riots that erupted from time to time it is unfair to assume that the soldiers and police were the only ones responsible for the deaths and injuries were there no looters vandals infighting if you had ever witnessed these riots would you think that more people might have been hurt or killed had the soldiers not opened fire it s also incredibly naive to assume that all tibetans think the same even dharamsala the seat of the tibetan government in exile is not without opposition violence and even assasination while i do think that most tibetans are good buddhists and nice people the documentary seems to associate everything sinful with the chinese and everything saintly with the tibetans this is something i find totally unacceptable a few snapshots of tibetan mobs welcoming the delegates from exile tell us nothing the documentary seems only able to find tibetans who are against chinese rule they paint the picture that nobody in tibet is happy this is patently untrue but then this sort of thing sells in america you have to have a demon you have to have a damsel in distress and you must have the hero america in this case otherwise it just won t sell it s not about compassion at all if you really want to be illuminated visit tibet and tibetan communities all over china and see things for yourself that would be far more enlightening sadly many journalists prefer to interview the wrong right people in order to get a sensational story that will pay for the rent

1,i m almost finished reading this book and what a long fun ride it s been wordy and a little confusing this book has to be taken in the right mood or else you ll miss the humor the places that the main character travels to are memorable and exciting and i found myself getting through a hefty portion without thinking that i had ever started some no more like most of the satire is cryptic and hard to find however i read up on the book and it immediately popped out at me and made alot more sense this is an excellent book that i m sure you will enjoy it might even suit as a read aloud story for younger children
1,i m a handicap and i ve never bought a swing trainer before but i saw the infomercial and thought it was worth a try it arrived yesterday and i went through the warm up and practice first the grip felt very uncomfortable over the years i had settled into a very comfortable and very incorrect grip this device corrected it immediately although i didn t know it at the time after going through the routine described in the directions i went out to the backyard and hit wiffle balls my grip still felt funny but my tempo swing path and release had improved in just a few minutes this morning i went to the driving range the improvement was dramatic my iron shots were longer and straighter but that uncomfortable grip caused some stray shots with my driver after about ten driver swings i got the hang of it and wow there s a screen out at yards on a good shot i usually hit it on one bounce today i was hitting the screen to feet up off the ground thanks david i can t wait to get out on the course tomorrow

1,jean renoir s masterpiece the grand illusion is truly a film about humanity it is a universal theme something we can all understand and relate to the triumph of the human spirit in the most troubled times is kind of an ironic theme considering hitler s imminent rise to power and the ensuing war that would alter the course of history nevertheless jean renoir s poetic homage to brotherhood is one of his most beloved films it is not hard to like this movie the acting and direction are superb jean gabin is one of the all time great actors jean renoir s innovative approach would influence countless directors to come including orson welles criterion did a marvelous job on this dvd also worth getting is the rules of the game jean renoir s greatest satire

0,the photo presented here is a bit too bright and the faces are not that orange in this paperback edition s cover however you can get a feel for the checked floor and how after opening the pages of the doorbell rang you get an eye sore with the blue checkered tablecloth in the kitchen with the blue stove and red appliances the mother and daughter are both redheads and there is a black cat that hangs around during the story that takes place in the kitchen with just twenty pages my seven year old breezed through the book in six minutes the favorite character in the book according to my son is the cat and watching where he was throughout the story the doorbell rang begins with a mother placing a plate of cookies on the kitchen table for her son sam and daughter victoria i ve made some cookies for tea said ma the children each took six cookies comparing the look and smell of these cookies to grandma s by flipping through the pages of the doorbell rang it looks like the kitchen table got bigger but upon further inspection the same number of chairs are there but more kids around the table and fighting over the seats the cat is making his way around the kids to receive pats on the head and attention more kids arrived bringing a bicycle and a doll carriage and the table shows each kid with one cookie it is hard to tell if the cookies are on white plates or that is just part of the checkered tablecloth the serving plate is clearly empty at this point and all the kids turn to see the latest bell ringer meanwhile over at the stove the steam is continuing but at a larger pace and it looks like fresh water now in the orange pail the final arrival for this story is grandma with a large cookie sheet type tray carrying freshly baked chocolate chip cookies all the kids leave the table to greet her and the cat ends up alone on the kitchen table not very sanitary as far as i am concerned and my son noticed no napkins or drinks at the table the dirty floor was bothering him as well and he wondered why the kids never took their shoes off for that is something we all do upon entering our home the portrayal of the mother and how the stove was not being attended and having the cat on the table bothered me the kids not stopping to wipe their feet or hanging up their own belongings and no one washing their hands before having a cookie and who knows how many times the kids each touched one of them at least the kids were dressed nice and the bucket of water never spilled and the mother finally sat down for a new reader this might be a fun read but for more than one read i highly doubt there would be interest there is a lot of repetition with the arrival of new kids and then the sharing of the cookies while comparing them to each child s grandma s cookies there are roughly two to four sentences on each page the good news is that my son did not ask for any cookies after reading this
0,i recall this movie fondly unfortunately the dvd quality is so poor this cannot be watched pity amazon does not allow negative stars the their ratings don t waste your time until someone cleans this up but it makes a nice coaster though
1,many of my colleague use blackberry for emails but i give a try on this brand new wi fi camera equipped smartphone the and wi fi works very well in our area it also worked very well in europe after activation of the cellphone by cingular customer service e mail and internet works very well in both locations addition of microsd chip actually solve many of the bluetooth file transfer issues since i can simply stick the microsd card into regular sd cassette and use a card reader and usb cable for file transfer from pc or mac like other memory chips the color calibration and default focus of the camera is very good and video is very good quality for the cameraphone again allow you to take a very long video in windows media player format installation of good mail system automatically synchronize to lotus note emails contacts and calendar any time any place and automatically chime schedule notices the only drawback are the battery life which require frequent charges slow keypad for phone calls and i do not know how to silence the keypad and a little tough keyboard touch lack of shift keys on both sides sometimes makes key typing difficult especially shift a in addition microsoft word processing is slow and so as excel which will require a faster chip overall a great all around pocket pc in this generation
1,a film that s a little like trying to find your way out of a house of mirrors or an attempt to reassemble an image once it has been split by a prism since nothing is as it seems we may as well be inside a fictionalized world like the unicorn story the main character cathryn is writing this fantasy is read aloud throughout the film creating a framework whose only relevance to the story unfolding is to reassure us that we have stepped into a world that is a creation of the imagination however the fact that is comes from the mind of a schizophrenic is hardly reassuring a glance at the cast of characters hints that they are not necessarily who or what they seem hugh is played by rene rene is played by marcel who is played by hugh cathryn is played by susannah and susannah plays cathryn insanity is not an ordering principle of the mind but rather a vain attempt to put order to an ever changing palette of images that may or may not be reflections of images within the mind instead of outside a very atmospheric film made more so by the disturbing score that is not altogether in sync with the action another technique that constantly keeps the viewer off balance

0,with the greatest respect to the incredible bob beldon joe zawinul and wayne shorter this box set should contain a warning the warning is simple if you already own most of the stuff in this collection don t bother if you re completely new to weather report buy it coming from someone that s seen the band perform every year since and own all their official and quite a few other releases i was really disappointed with this project except for the booklet here are a few things that are puzzling a weather report box set includes three songs two composed by zawinul and one by shorter that were never released by weather report a in a silent way released by miles davis b super nova released by wayne shorter c experience in e excerpt released by cannonball adderly i agree with the liner notes that point to these songs as pre cursors but mentioning them would have been enough they are all in print an incredible typo stating that alphonse mouzon was the drummer on unknown soldier including a barely improved version of nubian sundance that has been in circulation for many years from other sources including another better than but not by much version of the other sources for the rockpalast concert on dvd not remastering any of the original recordings the tape hiss from the live in tokyo i sing the body electric songs is still clearly heard and not upgrading those old recordings is just plain unacceptable in this day and age finally the cover itself i have no words except to admit i don t get it having said all that negative stuff weather report remains the dominant creative machine of the jazz rock fusion era and those that missed it should buy this without hesitating if you re a long time weather report fan there s absolutely nothing to get excited about here the dvd was especially disappointing to me i have had that concert on vhs tape for many years and now on dvd all from other sources and was shocked to see such incredible video noise on the official version zawinul s black and white keys look like polka dots in many places i played the dvd in different players two tv s and my computer monitor to make sure it wasn t my equipment i should have paid attention to the pr person at sony that told me the concert was taken from a re broadcast of the show and not from the master tapes it s my own fault for having unrealistic expectations i should probably clarify that while the dvd is in fact clearly better than the un offical version it still looks like a bootleg sad it is of some significance that this review is the first time i ve chosen to speak out about something in fusion that was less than flattering it should also be noted that my disappointment is aimed directly at cbs sony bmg and not the musicians producers i m still amazed that this record company can see fit to release this and hold back the already remastered mahavishnu orchestra live in cleveland cd that was supposed to be released in lastly let me make it perfectly clear that zawinul shorter and beldon are musicians and people i personally hold in the highest esteem with zawinul and shorter being musical divinities as far as i m concerned while my review is an obvious personal venting and i realize that zawinul and shorter gave this project their stamp of approval i think that shouldn t be mistaken for a personal attack my remarks are simply observations with some attitude directed at cbs sony bmg by rick calic jazz rock world

1,the boston based author dennis lehane wrote a great detective story with a social background so great it is almost more important than the plot mystic river differs from lehane s other books and indeed raises him to the next level as a writer mystic river is set in the fictional boston suburb called east buckingham the author explains it as an amalgamate of dorchester charlestown and south boston and it really feels like dorchester home mostly to white working class with plenty of crime i liked the background info especially since i could relate to it knowing the area the first part which is the base and explanation for later events takes place in when one of the three eleven year old neighborhood boys playing in the street is abducted by two men in an apple smelling car and although he comes back after four days his life as well as his friends is changed forever the ways of the boys soon part dave the boy taken by the men lives a quiet life has a wife and a son and likes his memories of being a football player in high school jimmy the bad boy after doing some time in prison settles down as a storeowner with a nineteen year old daughter from his first marriage second wife and their two daughters the third boy college educated sean becomes a policeman when jimmy s beautiful daughter katie is found murdered in the park after a night out dave comes home covered in blood sean gets assigned to the case there are many leads to different people but the case is difficult meanwhile jimmy and his family embark on the search of their own the plot is very good until the end and psychological details as well as the insights into the society are extremely accurate the characters are very real especially jimmy and sean who are central to the plot their trauma after dave s abduction made a lasting effect on their lives in very different ways they are complicated multifaceted people very well developed as literary characters some side protagonists depicting perhaps types rather than individuals bobby roman the savage brothers sergeant whitey are very good i was in the grasp of this book until the end it is not only great entertainment but also food for thought the movie based on mystic river with sean penn is equally moving recommended for those with little time

0,purchased pairs for my year old daughters for christmas the shoes are made of cheap pieces of plastic the box includes bunches of black elastic bands that you need to really s t r e t c h onto the shoes to provide the bounce the more your child weighs the more bands you use but you have to double or triple them onto the same hooks they are very hard to install and could be dangerous if they snap back into your face while you are installing them once assembled the kids played with them for about minutes before becoming bored they haven t played with them since don t waste your money

0,as a fan of zombie movies and as someone who enjoyed city of the living dead and zombie i was very disappointed with house by the cemetery fulci manages to create a good mystery in the first two thirds of the movie only to squander it on some poorly executed scare scenes house by the cemetery is about an researcher whose work is never specified who moves his wife and his kid into a house in massachussets in order to finish out the work of a colleague who killed himself and his mistress the titular house is the only place they can really find for the moment so dr boyle his wife lucy and their son bob move in despite a lot of bad signs like the boarded up door to the cellar and a tombstone for a dr jacob tess freudstein in the front hall bob has little red headed girl for a friend who keeps warning him about how bad the house is though no one else sees her furthermore people keep claiming dr boyle has been in town before with a non existent daughter which he denies not totally convincingly he also seems to have some secret relationship with the babysitter anne who starts unboarding the cellar door in the middle of the night and lucy seems to either be recovering from or suffering from serious psychological issues got that good because half of that stuff never gets explained the only things that get worked out are the little red headed girl s identity and the identity of the killer neither of which are that hard to figure out there are some nice visual moments in the earlier parts of the film the fact that the killer has one normal hand and one rotting hand the photograph that changes with each viewing a mannequin that gets beheaded and starts bleeding but fulci s ability to handle the gore moments disappoints he lingers too long over some deaths makes the killer so ridiculously slow that a snail could outrun him and bits like the babysitter s head falling down the stairs come off as funny rather than scary compared to the injury to the eye scene in zombie or christopher george chopping through the coffin in cotld dr boyle s chopping through the door around his son s head feels like self parody fulci s other films have incoherent plots but rarely in a way that seems to work against the plot the dream like nature of city of the living dead seems appropriate given the prophetic dream the heroine gets and the mystical nature of the threat and the execution of the setpieces is usually fantastic house by the cemetery has neither thing working in its favor it s not hell of the living dead level bad but the fact that it has some genuinely good acting especially paolo malco who plays dr boyle and an interesting set up almost make the flaws worse also this version has a never before seen deleted scene but it has no sound and is just an extended reaction shot after the bat attack
0,this piece took forever to assemble arriving in no fewer than pieces the directions are vague everything in the diagrams is a rectangle but the actual parts aren t labeled so you never know which of the types of rectangular parts they mean when finished all of the front slats between the drawers fell out anytime we moved it they have no bolts to hold them in the just sit in shallow slots the drawers are shaky and the whole unit is unstable also as many of the holes are not lined up so i couldn t even put in some of the bolts
1,this gun is pretty good but im not sure about the power being fps and the battery takes too long to charge although the clip only holds rounds the gun is deadly accurate and very powerful when charged long enough but please do not buy this gun for use as a sniper because the scope is a piece of s i recommend blowing it up anyway to answer that person s question the cocking handle is just for looks now back to my review the scope does not have red crosshairs as i ve heard people say and the sights are much better although you should tighten the screws the foregrip on this gun is awesome as you can fold it up or down and is not too wobbly in the down position overall this is a great gun and i would highly recommend it to any airsoft player and plus it s only
1,i definitely can tell when a great game show can be fun as a board game unfortunately that absolutely isn t always the case one of my all time favorite quiz shows back in the s was super password with bert convy the game of course showcases a celebrity and a regular contestant trying to guess their way to guess a mystery word for a puzzle this edition doesn t reflect on that edition this board game edition is a example of the original password with the late allen ludden the game is still fun and enjoyable for those who actually haven t seen the original password like myself but it is just delightful unfortunately it isn t much fun reflecting on this version and relating to the bert convy edition hopefully when password is remade it will be just like the themed s edition of the nbc game show price b game c fun enjoyment b overall c

1,i love these magazines we subscribe to ladybug spider and cricket each for a different child the stories are great as is the illustration an illustrator friend of mine says that it is very prestigious to be asked to illustrate a story in these magazines and i figure it is the same for the stories no advertising of course the thing i like the best is that each magazine is geared toward a certain age of child highlights tries to be something for everyone so we look through the magazine to find an appropriate story in ladybug we just start at the beginning and read straight through as the publisher will tell you when your child outgrows ladybug you just let them know and they change your subscription to spider and later cricket that s as far as we ve gotten

1,i have been playing guitar for a little over years and i really love these strings i have tried brands such as ghs ernie ball dr and more but these seem to have one of the best feel they have a real clarity in tone and are a great match especially for someone starting out playing it will help their fingers not bleed as much because of the feel the only brand that i think is a bit better is dean markley blue steels they last longer are brighter and i am liking the feel a bit better as well none the less for the price and over all value these strings are awesome and even in my house you will find a dozen sets ready to string up
0,my year old son got this for his birthday the screws are so deep inside the ball we finally got so frustrated we just ripped off the foam covering the battery holder to be able to see where to place the screwdriver to get the screws out the ball won t bounce anyway even then the screws would not come out the lightup goal is great but the ball is ridiculous use your old nerf balls and then it s okay
1,i am not disappointed this grill cooks hot degrees within about minutes in fact i ve had the grill about a month and i think i ve grilled days of the month i need to watch it with all the meat but man i m loving it it s so convenient my last grill didn t cook as hot it didn t leave the grill marks it didn t have the flavor of what this grill offers there is not much to complain about i dropped it while trying to put it together by myself i thought it was going to break my floor not the other way around this sucker is tough i m glad i didn t go cheap i can t afford for a grill so this was a good medium for me my last grill i paid for it rusted in years and the replacement parts cost almost as much as the grill so i dumped it i think i ll get my money s worth out of this weber at this price even with the shipping it was cheaper to order online through amazon than to buy local i consider this one of the smarter purchases i ve made on amazon bad side has nothing to do with the grill but amazon shipped it through a company named egl or eagle for a logistics company they sure don t know what their doing the delivery date kept changing and eventually it was a week later than the original estimated date they sent it from reno to sacramento to chicago to omaha and back to chicago then back to omaha from omaha they hired two dudes and a truck to drive it to des moines where i live once in des moines they called me while i was at work i met them at a gas station on the highway and lead them to my house it took about minutes to find them because the one that spoke english was still new to the language no problem they were nice enough fellas but i m just not used to going to get my stuff when i order from amazon i ve ordered at least items off of amazon normally i track it thru the internet and it shows up at my door in this case i had to call a freight company to get the status then the directing drivers around business i guess this was a special order and maybe that s why they can sell it at this price
1,the print looks like you re watching it through muddy water is this something to do with the unclear public domain status of this and other of capra s works doesn t he have a family that could help out his dvds the way that chaplin s family has done or even to use the opposite extreme the family of edgar ulmer who have released superlative versions of some pretty dicey movies the point is that if people are paying for something they deserve to get it served up nice and all the various dvds of meet john doe are painful to watch we ve heard for years of the re worked ending of the film and that another one exists or existed at one time bring it on for now the pleasure is nearly entirely in watching gary cooper react to barbara stanwyck s pure life it s sort of like ball of fire but a bit more subtle moviemakers knew they were on to agood thing teaming the two because cooper s slow moving nearly snakelike screen presence got an injection of caffeine when placed next to stanwyck s vibrant beauty and her gorgeous clear gaze and complexion she doesn t even have to speak she emanates something very basic in her bones and her posture okay the movie writes itself into a corner for what else is going to happen except that if gary cooper is not going to kill himself the movie will break the trust it s established with the viewers this has always been doe s problem that it has to cheat to come out ahead of itself and it didn t work in and it still isn t working now it s great up until about an hour and fifteen minutes then you feel the gears start to whine and complain as hollywood tries to solve a basically philosophical dilemma
1,i m dumbfounded by some of the reviews this page guess they just didn t get it this film is hilarious it s clever witty and extremely entertaining travolta is classic as the pathetic gameshow host wannabe weather man the characters are so well defined and so sadly pathetic in their own ways it s what makes the film such a classic comedy it s unbelievable that more people have not caught on to it if you liked the big lebowski orange county the cable guy any film with esoteric characterization you will absolutely love this film it s a dark comedy people get over it
0,the epson is a purely photo printer be sure to understand this before you buy so if you are planning to have one printer and think this is it think again the inks are not compatible with plain paper and any documents you print on plain paper are horribly color shifted and distorted it took three calls to epson and replacing the icc profile before they would finally admit that the problem was the ink compatibility with the plain paper all the magazines raved about the black and white printing quality not at least not on premium quality photo paper perhaps in some of the more expensive matt papers i saw very little improvement over my epson now if you are going to use it strictly for a photo printer then this is very nice printer the biggest drawback is you will not find the ink cartridges at any major store such as staples the in stock ink guarantee there does not apply to items not carried in the strore this is hint hint if you run out of ink on a weekend and need to have something for monday you are sol the only option you have is to order the ink online trust amazon as they can find and deliver however if for some reason your lucky enough to have a large pro photo store near bye they may have the cartridges cartridges certainly dont last very long and at each with eight of them your burning a set bulk ink tanks are coming out but i doubt the inks will be imitated if you can stand ordering everything online and are only looking for a great photo printer than this may be just the ticket for you however at i fully expected to be able to print documents with pictures on plain paper i haven t been happy with this printer and i plan to replace it soon amazon s being able to locate and ship the ink is the only reason its still here

0,i received this tea chest as a gift and am just now getting around to trying the teas the chest is beatiful and will be great for future use however i am thoroughly dissatisfied with the tea although the bags are highly aromatic the tea is very bland as if the bags were old i am sure bentley teas are usually fresh and tasty just not the box i received
0,i read this book for a book report and because i could not choose another one i could not stop reading it because i was forced to read this book i now have the knoledge and misfortune of this pathetically boring story the steriotypical characters hurried through the story full of excuses star for one very boring book
0,i got one of these because it was only a penny i used it several times with only a slight crack that i later cemented later i used it again and while cocking it back the whole top piece just splintered into many pieces the gun is fun for about the first few tries then it s prone to jamming up even though it was only a penny it was shipping i m better off getting one for about a dollar at a flea market i m not very satisfied but i m not spending cents to get my penny back
1,this software is easy to use it s like tax software it ask questions you answer has everything i wanted it for and a lot more i would recommend it cheaper than a lawyer
1,i am going to write this review mostly for those familiar with the original disgaea as such i will not get to much into the aspect of gameplay and the system of the game aside from things that have changed or are important to note having said that let s begin the game begins in the land of veldime an alternate world from that of the first game where an evil overlord named zenon has hidden from well everyone when he came into veldime however he placed a curse on the land that changed all humans into demons the effects weren t all immediate as some still have several human qualities but if the curse is not reversed soon there will be no turning back thus the hero adell oddly enough the only person unaffected by zenon s curse sets out to defeat the overlord in the opening there is an attempt to summon zenon to adell so he can fight him but it goes awry and zenon s daughter accidentally gets summoned instead bound to adell by the summoning pact she has no choice but to accompany him to the castle where he intends to kill her father albeit not without scheming a bit herself in a nutshell the story is good nothing amazing but with ample opportunity for the humor most have come to love about the original the only really new additions to the battles are the ability to do stack attacks and if you are quick enough throw diagnally the basis of stack attacks are that after building the tower of aliies using the lift command the person on the bottom of the tower still has the ability to attack in doing so they begin passing the enemy up the tower with everyone taking a shot at him and then spiking him back to the ground essentially a team attack of up to characters there have been updates to the dark assembly with factions of senators being introduced and it can be easier to pass some bills if you are lucky since quite often some senators will show up to vote drunk random vote basically or even asleep no vote at all perhaps the most entertaining addition though is felonies you can recieve a felony for things such as power leveling having to much hp sp mana or even killing your own allies the benifit of felonies is that on top of any stat boosts you may get it is easier to pass proposals at the dark assembly and for every felony on a character they gain extra exp this works all the way up to felonies exp bonus the game has made all the necessary additions to make the gameplay top that of the original however in my opinion there feels like something is missing the characters seem a bit more by the book and not as wonderfully absurd as the original that and the voice acting isn t quite as good as the that of the first disgaea plus etna has a new voice actress despite all of that however the game plays much better and even looks a bit smoother to boot all in all it is a great game and a worthy sequel to an amazing game while some may like the changes in the characters and others may not there is no denying that the core of the game is much better than the original and will keep you addicted for just as long if not longer
1,even though this costs a bit more its worth every penny it is so easy to put in the buggy my son is comfy and fits in it very well
0,i purchased this product for my niece having had positive experiences with similar items and finding the price to be too tempting however what had been the hope of introducing her to the videogames of my generation turned into an exercise in frustration from the outset the screw to the battery casing stripped with very little application of a screwdriver the titles suffered from redundancy and many of them required the use of too many buttons what was the most disappointing aspect of this item was the potential it possessed perhaps fewer similar titles and a re configuration of the button commands would ensure the promise of this product
1,the gym is very easy to assemble took me about minutes on my own the book supplies several different workouts hitting every major muscle group and you get good resistance in every workout you won t get great range of motion on all the workouts there may be times when you ll need to lean back or put yourself in a different position in order to get a full stretch but those are minor adjustments you d probably have to make on any other type of equipment the gym itself is light easy to move around the house and doesn t take up much space it may be too light and not sturdy enough in some instances and you will need to stand on the frame in the stand up workouts the price is outstanding at dollars you re not going to find a better deal than this and the workout is very comparable to the far more expensive bowflex
0,i can do this without the system it s simple why don t you get a pair of pound dumbells and put them in the ground then do pushups trust me it works i do it all the time and the results are nearly similar without buying anything
1,specifically recommended by x play on tv absolutely agree that the recommendation was good i rolled my eyes at my wife when she wanted to spend bucks on this game and i think i actually called it totally retarded she let me play it first and within minutes i was hooked she s not allowed to play it because it s mine all mine yes i m years old and she still can t have it i d recommend this game to anyone not looking for an advanced game requiring weeks of play and advanced storyline if you like tetris but want a little more variety and just a little more skill requirement and a good laugh this game is for you there s something oddly satisfying by rolling over the dog and seeing his legs twitter in the air when minutes earlier he was pushing you around weird yes fun yes i d say good for years because young kids may find this too boring because they won t appreciate how strange and cool this game really is
1,i have had this horn on my triumph bonneville america for about a year it is extremely loud and attracts alot of attention it was easy to install and has proved to be very reliable
1,fly through spanish is some of the best software for the fly pen available you can write a word in english and hear the spanish translation or write a spanish word and hear the english translation the translator will also spell out translations for you my only complaint is that the translations are spelled a bit too quickly especially if you re trying to write them down the cartridge even comes with some games to help you learn spanish words fly through spanish also comes with a booklet that has verb conjugation charts and ideas for games you can play i was very impressed with the verb charts they actually includes all the tenses and a chart of irregular verbs fly through spanish is a great tool for learning and practicing spanish words please keep in mind that this software will not teach you spanish but it is a wondeful and downright fun addition to a class or self study program i hope that leapfrog releases more languages especially french

1,i bought this phone as part of the sprint nextel sero plan i used it for about days before deciding that it didn t fit my needs for several reasons outlined below battery life was sporadic i got maybe a day worth of power from it one time it completely discharged overnight for the price of the phone and the two year contract it carries this is a dealbreaker the nextel network coverage has gone downhill in my area i was a former nextel subscriber for years so i have some experience with coverage around town i was getting disconnects and sporadic no signals the phone would sporadically mute the ringer an incoming call would light up the display but there would be no ringing this seems to happen after i had put the phone on vibrate and then turned it back to ring for the same monthly service fee i was getting less access to web services and no high speed internet ability admittedly the high speed access is not as useful on a tiny screen but if i m going to be locked into a year contract i would like to have some fast internet access on the phone the still uses the slow nextel data network i was not a direct connect walkie talkie user if i were then my opinion of this phone might be a little higher since nextel presently has arguably the best fully functioning walkie talkie network i could not justify being locked into a year contract with equipment that seemed sub par on a network that did not and likely never will support the latest high speed technologies below were my initial impressions during the time i used the phone thankfully motorola designed the phone so the micro sd card is accessible from the outside no need to pull the battery to update the card here s the big things i don t like you cannot use any songs that you transfer to the micro sd card as ringtones you also cannot readily load additional wallpapers unless it is a picture you took with the phone or a paid download any message mms that you send to yourself can only be set as a caller id image and not wallpaper battery life on my phone is flaky i m getting maybe a day and one half with usage that approximates minutes talk time and perhaps to picture messages you must pay nextel to download ringtones there are some users who have modified the phone and reportedly are able to use ringtones off their micro sd memory card however the process is more technical than what your average user might want to tangle with note sprint and nextel are both owned by the same company if you re making a decision on sprint vs nextel there are only a couple reasons that i can think of to recommend nextel over sprint first if the nextel coverage is better second if you have a need to use the nextel walkie talkie feature the sprint side of the company features phones with significantly enhanced web browsing and higher speed data communications the nextel side clings to the larger phones and aims their services at the industrial construction market for almost every consumer the sprint side is a better deal sprint in my experience has better customer service whereas nextel tends to transfer you endlessly among a variety of customer service representatives here s my summary of this phone after using it about two weeks the good beautiful speaker phone compact design solid feel megapixel camera ability to capture movies flip swings open when you push a button nextel sms mms messages can now be auto downloaded i believe this is the first nextel phone to sport this feature nice loud audio both nextel walkie talkie and directalk support the bad can t play ringtones off micro sd or via any other non nextel transfer note technically some people have been using a motorola product called webjal to make transfers with a cable but this may be more technical than the average user would like to tackle nextel is in my opinion on their way out as a carrier soon to be completely assimilated into the sprint side of things while not entirely unexpected it means that nextel plans and features are not as attractive to non construction users nextel s core group if you want mobile to mobile unlimited minutes you pay more versus most sprint plans which include them nextel doesn t have the super fast data speeds or network web browsing of competing carriers most web browsing on nextel is limited to character based wap sites that both crawl along speedwise and present unexciting character based screens the phone is a little bigger that what some have grown accustomed to while not phone related some users in larger cities have reported the iden system is nearing capactity with a lot of busy signals i am only getting about a day of battery life which is extremely low

1,well here we are one of the true works of the electronic genre in the s lifeforms is true sonic adventure this is obviously some of the best work that fsol ever did lifeforms is a double album of electronic and ambient moments spliced together interchanged and meshed for ambient work it has a lot of randomness and bright detail thrown in at a rapid pace there is a lot of energy and terse grab to the songs despite their being ambient it is very original i praise originality in music give it a try put on some flower bird wings or some elaborate burn

0,this movie works if one of the following four descriptions applies to you you think kevin zegers is hot you want to see anything he s in and the swimming scene in transamerica was the best thing to happen to you since you first had a peanut butter sandwich you think nick carter is hot and want to see if he can act he can t you like horror movies no matter how bad they are simply because it s a horror movie for some reason unbeknownst to man you are interested in what judge reinhold is doing with his career within the first five minutes of the film i had it pegged as a friday the style movie within the first five minutes it was then it expanded a bit and we saw some interplay between father and son and also some rather useless and pointless teenage romantic angst in this rendition the headless horseman actually had a head it was a pumpkin and it growled there was also some serious fire that he was capable of apparently in the beginning this fire was not with him when he needed it the most and of course he used a sword to decapitate victims lucky then that kevin zegers character was on the fencing team odd for such a small town to have a fencing team don t you think and when he was able to get his hand on a sword at the very end well you get the picture judge reinhold was a riot in the in this movie he was a football coach who talked about how things were when he played ball i can t imagine a universe in which reinhold played the kind of football he was talking to his players about he would have died during his first game he did though walk around the house with a football jersey on and some silly pajama pants so i guess that fit the role of a football coach still all in all i was certain that this review would be a one star review then it came out of the jason woods and became marginally better i was interested in the film for two reasons first i m still waiting to see if kevin zegers can act i have a feeling that he s going to break out of the horror mold he s in and become a lesser jamie lee curtis unfortunately in transamerica they had him play a petulant teenager they didn t give him room i e they didn t write anything for him that would have allowed him to express any range either that or he doesn t have any second i do like horror films even bad ones which this was just because i enjoy bad horror films doesn t make it a good movie which this wasn t i was just about to post this review then saw the three four and five star reviews i m sorry what were you guys smoking when you watched this are you kidding me as a bad horror film this succeeds but bad horror films don t get three four or five star reviews it s insane
0,i think i just don t like pilates because i really didn t care for this workout plus you are constantly roling up and down and from years as a ballet dancer we have always been taught that rolling your spine when working the stomach will not flatten the stomach it will cause the muscle to bulk up in your stomach and you ll have a round hard belly this is not my idea of an attractive waist line and this is true because it happened to a girl in one of my classes so that s the main reason i just didn t like this video
1,a wonderful book you will meet many charming cats on your jounrey here that will stay with you forever although this book is only pages it took me a long time to read it while many things made me smile or laugh out loud far too many things made me cry and i had to stop reading and set it aside for awhile i often wondered if i could even finish it but i am glad that i did it is a book that truly touches the heart
1,i looked at this camera the panasonic the sonys the jvc and even canon s bigger brother the i found this one to have fantastic reviews on dvinfo net a great video forum my concerns about vs were addressed to my satisfaction there really isn t a difference i like tape vs the hvx s expensive storage solutions one concern i had was will it look like a pro camera that is important in some situations where your equipment gives you added credibilty with clients and talent as soon as i opened the box i was in love this is a really substantial camera especially with the opt wide angle from canon and the matte box provided this does not look like your mama s camcorder i really like the manual controls so that you don t have to go thru menus to change parameters the layout of everything is great i really like the dual on off and zoom controls top of handle plus rear right side holding the handle for low or medium height shots is very very comfortable and the controls are perfectly positioned only down side and it is incidental the matte box is a bit flimsy lightweight plastic that helps with weight but i worry about breaking it some may say that hdv codec is not as good as dvcpro but my eye does not see it the colors are magnificent and it blows away many other cams in low light if you are looking for point and shoot this is not your baby but if you want a pro quality camera for a really great price this is it

1,now that i m writing this review it seems silly that i m so happy over such a small thing as a toothbrush but i am i bought this item not long after i had my first and hopefully only root canal and crown four years ago something which i never again want to experience in my life as someone else described it was painful and expensive growing up i didn t take care of my teeth like i should ve so i m accustomed to always being told there s either a cavity or the start of one and having to have more work done after the root canal my mom recommended a brush that had at least a certain number of pulsations oscillations because that s what she d been recommended by her dentist to combat her receding gums this specific item met those requirements and it was affordable when i first started using it my gums were very sensitive to it but that quickly wore off so it seems to me that it strengthens the gums it is also much easier to get behind the front teeth subsequent dentist vists by my mom have shown that her gums have improved dramatically after using a high quality electric toothbrush such as this one i honestly don t remember if she has this exact model but ours are similar and i ve not needed any work done at the dentist beyond regular cleanings since i purchased it as far as cleaning the unit to keep it from gunking up i m the only person who uses this item so any extra toothbrush heads are still in the package they came in not dripping into the storage container so i don t know how to combat that but i just take the toothbrush head off the thing and rinse it then rinse the hand held part and set them back on the unplugged charger base i only plug it in when the battery runs low and things stay clean with no problem

1,rice bran is the secret to these products and the results are immediately apparent in the texture of your skin after just one to two uses you start to notice a sense of calm and order descending upon your formerly sensitive skin this is especially apparent if you layer the products first using the cleanser toner and then the essence and skin creams if you have oily or combination skin you may be amazed at how balanced your skin becomes the skin essence contains mulberry that naturally lightens discoloration from sun damage and aging the antioxidants help to revitalize the skin this is applied before the cream who knew when we were climbing around in mulberry trees staining our fingers and faces as children that one day we would use an extract in a lotion that would heal the skin and lighten our skin age spots and freckles literally start to disappear or may even slightly whiten more than the surrounding skin so they literally seem to fade away i noticed this after just a few uses so it is super effective another reason to use this product is the super and i mean super fast healing properties i was amazed put this on any skin irritation and watch it disappear in days these products are so fun to use i ve incorporated them into a little night routine for my husband where i give him an antiaging facial before bed i saw the results of the products on my skin and wanted to share this secret with him his skin looked instantly more hydrated and he has dry skin with my combination skin i ve seen great results in balancing and clarity the cleansers are like the champagne of skincare and the rest of the line is equally impressive these are sort of out of my price range if i they didn t last so long and were not so effective you only need such a small amount so in the end it will be very economical and the results are superior to other products i ve tried the products also seem to encourage a natural exfoliation and deep cleansing so you save money on all those other products you used to have to buy all the time plus your skin will clear up and you can say goodbye to all those annoying costly solutions to a problem these products actually prevent the entire line deserves stars if you struggle to keep your skin clear these products also provide a new sense of confidence and are emotionally healing another surprising use for this product is on scars old scars and new scars they seem to just fade away as liv tyler once said i swear buy well she was talking about the shampoo i say collect them these products are essential and the best i ve ever tried the rebecca review

0,i am still waiting for these two pairs of gloves which were to have been usmailed and which were predicted to arrive yesterday march
0,overall i found this book disappointing in its defense its basic thesis of the movement of jewish american orthodoxy towards the right more closed and intensely religious is interesting and i am sure accurate and heilman s analysis of its evolution is insightful and well researched however i was extremely bothered by the lack of any attempt to portray hareidi society through the prism of its own value system or in fact any attempt to understand their values at all heilman accepts his own world view as absolute and obvious to the reader and in this context denigrates a society with an entirely different set of goals and aspirations examples of this include his assumption of the primacy of feminism and the worth of secular culture hareidi society has its own worldview which although too complex to elaborate on here has valid and very real reasons for its hierarchy of values reasons which heilman completely disparages or ignores for an example of a book that is not written by a religious author yet is able to appreciate hareidim from their own perspective try real jews by noah efron in general i found his view of religion as a mere sociological construct i e a defensive reaction to the holocaust to be grossly insensitive to the hareidi intense religious belief founded on thousands of years of tradition the latter half of the book i found a pathetic attempt to draw conclusions from insignificant pieces of information for example the juxtaposition of poster a condemning something to a poster advertising b implies that poster a is condemning b as well or two posters put out by the same company advertising two different types of music indicates that the community is embattled over the appropriateness of one type of music in conclusion although i eagerly awaited this book and found a fraction of it interesting and intelligent my overall impression is negative due to the authors biased approach and manipulative use of insignificant information
1,ok magazine the problem we have not received one copy can you please help with this
0,i purchased this coffee maker for my yr old son who loves to role play with the real coffee maker we have he was very excited about having his own coffee maker however after only a few days it quit working the lights and sound still work but the water won t run anymore he was very disappointed as this was his favorite part of the toy he still enjoys playing with the coffee maker so i will probably not return it because i think it would just break again and he has already accepted the fact that the water doesn t work
0,ok these tasted good although they were much tougher than the sugared brand i ate about a serving and a half and so did my husband right after we got them that evening we both had bloating and terrible flatulence it was the holidays so i didn t immediately attribute it to the vines i brought some to work to satisfy my afternoon sugar cravings and ate another serving sitting at my desk later that afternoon i was in an important meeting bloated beyond belief and trying not to embarrass myself i have since thrown out all my other bags these things create at best a very embarrassing and uncomfortable several hours and at worse a terrible health problem i think they should be taken off the market or at least labelled with a warning may cause significant distress to your digestive track and embarrassing flatulence

1,shooting with a dslr is great in a lot of ways but the sensor crop kills my wide angle capability which to me is absolutely awful personally i hate zoom lenses i ve got a full set of nikon primes and while i d prefer a prime lens these zoom lenses are the only game in town for wide angle on crop sensor dslr i like this lens because it goes wide on digital i suggest you buy this lens for the and keep it at because the wide end is really where it s at and the reason to buy this lens over the alternatives for anybody considering vs at the wide end unless you mostly use the narrower end of the focal length most of the time is a significant difference in field of view on short lenses as the focal length increases eg from to the difference in angle of view is not very large but the difference between is even though only is no laughing matter and if you don t believe me you can do a comparison in a camera shop to prove it to yourself if you end up deciding to get a you want to buy the sigma i think it is because that lens covers full frame and the angle of view has got to be absolutely amazing also if sigma or nikon reads this review please make an or rectilinear crop sensor prime and if sigma reads this review i want some or afd primes for film maybe even a digital sensor version in some medium range focal length i would definitely buy full frame coverage of course a mid length and a medium wide angle and a short tele neither nikon nor canon makes anything like that well canon kind of does did so you d have the market segment dominated

0,now i enjoy victorian adventure fiction as much as the next person in fact probably more than the next person since the average next person hasn t ever read any tales of derring do adventures to unexplored distant lands lost civilizations great artifacts etc that s all good stuff what s not good is this book which is tedious in the extreme on the surface of it haggard s followup to his hugely successful and infinitely better king solomon s mines has all the elements a dynamic duo of scholar adventurers one of whom is descended from pharaohs a mysterious message from the past delivered by a dying man an expedition to africa and a supernatural being who knows the secret of eternal life however despite this promising laundry list haggard s execution leaves a great deal to be desired a friend described it rather aptly as a book with a lot of story but not a lot of plot which is to say that in my edition some pages are filled without much happening there is the initial mysterious set up the journey to dark africa with the usual physical trials and tribulations the heroes conveyance to the lost city and then and then things kind of grind to a halt lengthy descriptive details lengthy internal ruminations lengthy rambling speeches lengthy everything but very little of consequence occurs until the very end when the heroes make a dangerous journey to find the eternal fire which grants nigh everlasting life i suspect much of the problem stems from the book s origin as a long running serial in the gazette as i understand it serial writers of the time were paid by the word or by the installment and thus it was to their advantage to spin their plots out as much possible hence the unhealthy ratio of action to words judicious editing could reduce the book to of its size without any loss of note of course as another friend pointed out it s probably best to read the book is small chunks just as one would have done with installments spreading out one s reading of it over a period of time he suggests may serve to conceal the book s rambling nature in any event there are some nice scenes here and there such as the moonlight battle between crocodile and lion and another involving human cadavers used as torches but those are about all i m likely to recall from this book in a year of course as is noted in the introduction to my edition haggard lifted the main elements of the plot and even the the true name of she who must not be named from several earlier adventure novels by edward bulwer lytton so one can t even give him much credit for imagination i suppose the book is worth reading by those interested in literary representations of the prevailing xenophobic sentiments of victorian englishmen racism anti semeticism misogyny fear of miscegenation etc but as entertainment for the modern reader it falls woefully short of the mark
0,this product is the worst of its kind it lasted a couple of months at the most it is not at all worth the price no matter how cheap i picked one up at walmart for ten bucks that works great don t waste your time on this one it is cheap but don t be had stay away from this product
1,h r block works well like it always has i ve used and liked h r since the turbotax activation debacle to the extent that i can like doing income tax what is great is the media the software comes on install the program and then have a nice flash drive to use elsewhere maybe flash drives will be like floppies someday with piles of used drives in a box but for now it s a super handy way to store and move a few files megs makes for a big floppy but a small flash drive no matter the price it right
0,i have to agree with the first two comments we went to check it out after my year old saw it on tv and liked it because the bear had glasses just like him the product seemed decent in the store so we bought it he has only played with it once or twice since christmas the only time he had fun with it was when i got mad and yelled at the thing because it wouldn t do what it is supposed to save your money and don t buy this junk
0,i totally didn t have a problem with the seller or anything great shipping um but the book kinda rots if you know how to tie a tie already then it might be fine but i don t the pictures didn t really help and the wording wasn t concise one sentence could be interpreted like nine ways i practically destroyed one tie definitely practice with a tie you don t care about or one that doesnt need to be dry cleaned cuz they get pretty rumpled
0,this straightener is great for thin hair but not for thick i myself have very thick hair and this straightener usually leaves my hair looking frizzy and very poofy the best hair straighteners out there are about thick or less and they normally have glass plates so if you have thick hair spend a little more money on something with a lot more quality
0,well of course i read the previous reviews regarding amazon shipping the grey market version of this timer and figured that certainly by now they were shipping a us version wrong i just received mine today and it s got the international warranty card and users manual i haven t decided if i m going to return it or not but figured that anyone else considering ordering this item should be advised that it appears that amazon is only shipping the grey market version of this unit
0,i really enjoyed my nano chi iron while it lasted rip it handles well it s a great straightener and it s a pretty color however i dropped it approximately two feet onto a carpeted floor and it stopped working i purchased the chi about four months ago and think that a iron should be a bit more resiliant i ll still purchase chi products but wouldn t recommend investing in the nano technology just yet there are a few kinks that still need to be worked out and it s not worth having to pay an extra to have it repaired
0,i have listened to a bunch of dean koontz books while listening to the second one i saw so many similarities which really turned me off and this flaw continued which each book i listen to which caused me to be reluctant to buy this book however most of the stories were pretty good so i stuck with him this is not the case with this book cold fire is absolutely horrible i so regret purchasing this book it is so bad that i have decided to swear off dean for looooooooong while just on a side note the bad place is the first dk book i read and it was very entertaining
1,these are really great they are very sour when eaten alone but amazingly good in cereal or oatmeal a great fruit to have on hand especially when they are out of season
0,other than the fact that it turns on this is a very cheaply made cheap looking cheap feeling product the bottom battery cover doesn t even connect properly and feels as if it will pop off at any moment did i mention cheap
1,this is the story of two tazo teas i found that they almost need one another to produce a tea of exceptional quality i tried each tea separately and finally blended them together tazo lotus and tazo wild sweet orange make a wonderful lemony hot tea in the winter or enjoy being tossed about with ice cubes in the summer the way i make this tea is by steeping two lotus and two wild sweet orange filterbags with ounces of water i make this in my coffee maker so there is plenty of time for the flavors to seep out into the steaming water then you can add tablespoons of orange blossom honey for hot tea and a bit more for ice tea drinking this blend is an aromatic experience lotus decaffeinated green tea is a blend of naturally decaffeinated green tea natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors wild sweet orange is a blend of lemongrass blackberry leaves citric acid rose hips spearmint leaves natural flavors orange peel safflowers hibiscus flowers rose petals natural orange essence ginger root and licorice root i love the crinkly sound of the paper bags protecting the precious contents the boxes are also quite intriguing and the stories on the tea packets are always mysterious and playful a romantic tea with a golden orange color i can never decide if i like this best hot or cold so i end up drinking it hot and cold half on ice and half in a mug when this tea is hot it is much more romantic and aromatic when chilled it takes on a more bitter component for something even more exotic try the tazo green ginger tea that was the first tazo tea i tasted and so far i can t think of a tazo tea i don t love the rebecca review
1,i bought this because i was moving from boston ma to phoenix az and driving myself and my daughters i was able to fill this thing to maximum capacity and was able to fit a small padlock on the zipper to secure it shut it rained and snowed on our trip and luckily we had everything already wrapped up in plastic bags this is not a waterproof cargo bag but rather water resistant when we got to phoenix i noticed that the front part of the bag had frayed and a hole formed i think this was more do to the straps that were hanging and hitting it than poor craftsmanship i recommend this bag if you are doing a short trip but not for long haul trips with a lot of highway driving good points was able to fill it really well was very easy to install not so good straps really can t be secured down and end up flapping in the win
1,tim burton offers the most charmingly off beat yet visually sumptuous movies in hollywood from his stop animation work the corpse bride to dark romances edward scissorhands to horror sleepy hollow burton never fails to offer feasts for the eyes that manage to make you squirm just a bit uncomfortably all the right notes are there but some are played just off key enough to create the thrill of tension perhaps no other director was so suited to film roald dahl s most famous work charlie and the chocolate factory and remain true to the author s vision most people associate the tamer goofy willie wonka and the chocolate factory starring gene wilder with dahl s tale but forget that dahl had a healthy streak of lemony snicket sensibility to him so it is perfect that burton makes a darker more dangerous film for all to enjoy the visuals in charlie are astounding the chocolate waterfall and river look like actual liquid chocolate not the icky brown water of willie wonka and the squirrel nut sorting room is a classic of mind blowing set design and that is not all oh no that is not all possibly the most visually stunning element in charlie is willie wonka himself played by burton favorite johnny depp depp sinks so deep into his roles that he becomes one with them and one wonders what inspired depp s quirky nervous mean spirited selfish concoction depp plays wonka as tight as he plays jack sparrow loose and he never misses a note but whereas gene wilder s willie wonka was more genial puppetmaster depp s wonka has a sadistic streak in him perhaps instilled by his dentist father this is a great if much maligned performance the most infamous element from the first movie was the seemingly drug inspired presence of the oompa loompas wonka s army of diminutive henchmen in the wilder film the oompa loompas were dwarfs given to sophomoric dance numbers to the irritatingly catchy oompa loompa do be de do tune in this version all the oompa loompas are played by the same character even though there are hundreds of them and their dance numbers are even more fantastic however the songs don t have quite the same sharp punch as the original songs which pointed out the various failings of the kids and their parents as they got eliminated from the contest indeed there are several lyrics that i just couldn t catch in this film version and that is a pretty major quibble far from a feel good movie but definitely a good movie charlie and the chocolate factory deserves to be seen and for fans of artistic visions studied
0,looks nice but beware installed norton on the workstations in our small office as soon as i did that our accounting system peachtree started to lock up a few times a day even after turing off the firewall on all workstations the accounting system still locked up i ve now uninstalled norton on the server pc and that seems to have solved the problem i wish now that i had just upgraded from norton internet security to never again

1,everyone should own this product i receieved my item on the day i was told it would arrive and it looked exactly like the picture
0,well it was shown as a full tang double bladed katana but after buying the item and checking it out for myself i have found its nothing more than a rat tailed show piece as far as show pieces go it does look nice however its not the full tang construction i was expecting to see and feel when i bought it fast shipping though
1,i love the way the fruit rehydrates in the milk in my breakfast cereal absolutely delicious
0,i bought this clock expecting it to show the humidity in a room show the temperature and to set itself for daylight savings it does neither of the above the temperature stays at and the humidity measure it always way off in the same room i have an alarm clock that does all of the above accurately the clock is attractive and easy to read and it keeps time ok but it should do more i am very disappointed
1,several tunes on back to oakland feature tower of power at their best one in particular that keeps me coming back is the deeply funky instrumental track squib cakes featured soloists include a short mellow guitar solo from bruce conte followed by greg adams fluegelhorn that first lurks in the pedal range leading one to believe it s a trombone and then soars brilliantly higher and higher to a dramatic finish tenor madness abounds from lead saxman lenny pickett known primarily for his work as lead tenor for the saturday night live band wailing in tune in the difficult altissimo range jazz musicians call these freak notes because they are not notes typically included in the range of the instrument while at the same time refusing to compromise on excellent rhythmic and melodic ideas throughout chester thompson completes the soloistic foursome with a chunky hammond organ solo that takes you back to a smoky bar in la in the early without the probability of cancer lyrical yet hard driving thompson lulls us first into his solo space by filling in behind the band as they chant squib cakes then takes off on his own flight delving out perfect note runs as though bach suddenly had learned some jazz hammond himself in the middle of the solo as if to a testament to the tightness of the groove thompson lingers on a treble note in his right hand chunks out chords so symmetrically with the rest of the rhythm section with his left that in the days of hearing this on vinyl i wondered if my record was skipping through that section to finish the groove at the end of thompson s solo the horns return to fill in a bridge with quick triplets after he closes we re back to the head to close out the tune even with so much to savor this syncopated gem will leave you hungering for more even after the final stroke of the last chord the musicianship and tightness of their groove more than make up for the bland lyrics on the album s other tunes i have listened to this album for years and revel in its freshness every time i spin it i recommend it as a definite primer for anyone wishing to explore tower of power s sound kathryn shut
1,we bought these because there was an online coupon for them my children ages and take lunches to school and i was looking for something beyond the usual chip choices the price was right and with the free shipping when going over it was hard to resist the fries are light and airy like a thin cheeto but with a more delicate flavor they are a nice change and we re really enjoying them
0,i read all the reviews and comments on this kodak printer i could find many gave glowing reviews i d just purchased a new kodak digital camera and thought this printer dock would make a perfect setup i was never able to get the printer to perform as kodak says it should it caused some odd conflict and my computer would not boot into windows xp with the printer attached to the computer i ended up having to disconnect the printer turn on my computer and then reconnect the printer in order to use it windows then had to always reinstall the printer drivers it was made even more frustrating by kodak s tech support i called and emailed multiple times for assistance in one conversation i was literally told i don t know what s wrong and can t help you now that s tech support finally the printer refused to print telling me that it was out of paper i tried all kodak s remedies none worked no matter how much or how little paper was in the machine it said there was no paper i even opened a fresh pack to find it still fussy and not let me print i can t recommend this printer i could give a better recommendation had kodak itself through its tech support at least have provided my with some competent assistance i got about dozen prints quite a large cost for printer and supplies for a few prints before the machine just failed to work at all about the only positive i can give is that the prints i did get looked good the color was nice i gave it an extra star for print quality alone kodak was a name that had some strength behind the name once upon a time it was synonymous with home photography once upon a time they ve lost something over the years and that is quality
1,we love the swaddle me blankets we have the flannel and the fleece this has helped us with getting our daughter to sleep through the night in just two weeks of using them she loves to be swaddled but is very strong and would wiggle out and then wake up and need to be swaddled again with the velcro she is less able to get out of the swaddle and feels safe and secure and sleeps longer the fleece has a little more stretch to it and is easier to use but the flannel is a little lighter weight for the summer so not to overheat have not tried the cotton ones definitely worth a try
1,i m a first home buyer so with the nice weather coming up i decided that i needed a grill so i wanted something that i could smoke too so the char broil smoker seemed like the ideal grill assembly was simple took about min i highly recommend using sockets and also using two different types of screw drivers a bigger bit size and a that will make the job easier also i just bought mine at walmart for havent used it yet but the concept seems simple enough probably only be able to fit slabs of ribs on it so cooking for a huge group wont be possible
0,this product is a waste of time don t bother the handheld game is entertaining for my daughter but connecting it online via the website is frustrating to say the least once connected we walked around the virtual world with nothing to do it is too complicated for my yr old to do alone there are much better products out there for children that are similar but easier to play with i would suggest webkinz or neopets these sites are very kid friendly and have educational games to play unlike the muichiz site good luck
1,after reading that bentley s has the finest ceylon teas in the world i decided to give this as a christmas gift to my husband he says it is the best tea he s ever had and since he is somewhat of a tea connoisseur i would consider that a compliment the box is beautiful and it makes a lovely presentation
0,this is not a good study guide for an employment law class too basic and general this may be good for a business owner wanting basic info about hiring firing etc but they would definitely still need to seek the advice of an attorney
1,what a great cookie you have perfect w coffee milk or alone not too sweet light and airy one of my favorite

0,after receiving putting together and using this toy with myself and children i overestimated what it would be i remember the old school rock em sock em robots and this product isn t even close the old characters stood tall and both necks sprung up with metal parts when a blow to the head was delivered this version has only plastic parts the characters are tall at best and the win is from a blow to the chest not the head metallo s head springs up but superman s head only nods backward it is difficult to discern the winner from the set up it was only an lesson for me to learn but if you truly want a real rock em set try ebay or yard sales this replica is not comparable to the original

1,most of the beautiful gardens i see are in washington or oregon or back east somewhere having lived in washington i do enjoy seeing some of the plants that i am missing here in colorado but it would be nice to see a more varied selction of gardens becasue we all can t live in the pacific northwest i have a subscription to sunset so i guess that will have to suffice but i do wish bh g would take that into consideration otherwise i love this magazine i used to get several magazines but this was always my favorite it is chock full of ideas that we can really use and i love the photography what sets bh g apart is that you can see a hint of life in these beautiful houses slippers on the floor newspaper on the table and often the owners of the home are in the pictures too they are sometimes blurred from movement which is actually nicer than a posed shot it helps set the feeling that this home is lived in and is attainable i would say get this magazine right away i would have given it stars except for the whole garden thing
0,i was given the ique for christmas of a few months into the new year i dropped it onto pavement and it broke for garmin replaced it with a refurbished unit which i consider a fair price unfortunately the refurb unit couldn t play directions at full volume so i returned it for another refurb this unit fell off the windshield still in it s cradle and it started making that frying sound of short circuits i called garmin and was told that if there was no obvious damage to the unit they d look at it under warranty i had told the guy what happened so i was pleasantly surprised they did in fact replace it under all circumstances the report you get back says the returned unit was within specifications or words to that effect even though clearly not i have no idea why units will be returned with new software keys to enter and the software will begin urging you to register even though you already have for some the mapping software on the will appear crippled it is a basic drive from here to there unit it does not allow you to load way points points of interest and the like each of the units had quirks on the first one every time i inserted the sd card with maps windows player or whatever it s called would start up and ask me if i wanted to search the card for tunes the second one had inaudible volume the fourth one has a problem common to the first one the brightness resets itself randomly to zero yep zero the first one left the powered brightness full on so you could give power and see to reset the battery brightness to half on but this one resets them both to zero so you may think the unit is not turning on but it s on you just can t see anything on the screen if you re outside you can put it in the sun and see dimly enough to navigate to the brightness setting but if it s dark you need a flashlight the current one will do a hard reset if i start the car with the unit plugged into the lighter and sometimes when i put it in the cradle this means i have to do the full new user routine touch the screen on the little plus signs to register the touch screen press and hold to learn again how to copy press and hold to learn again how to paste reset the time from olathe kansas to where i live all contacts notes calendars and other information is lost all preferences are gone after i ve gone through the restart routine the unit will then find the satellites and get me where i m going but i can t load destinations from contacts as they re gone so i have to type them all in by hand if the battery runs out of juice the unit is dead it forgets everything and i have to touch the screen where the plus signs are to register the screen press and hold to learn again how to copy press and hold to learn again how to paste reset the time from olathe kansas to where i live all contacts notes calendars and other information is lost all preferences are gone i complained about this to support at garmin and i was assured this is a microsoft feature and that garmin can do nothing about it they recommended that i buy a program from one of several vendors that backs up the data to an sd card where it will not be lost so now i carry a card with my detailed maps and a card with my backup data i did learn though that if the battery runs down the backup program is lost so you can t retrieve your data from the backup sd card unless you have told the program to save as self extracting archives i learned it the hard way of course to restore i pop out the detailed maps sd card insert the backup card navigate to the file explorer navigate to the sd card open the contents of the sd card select the latest back up click through the restore procedure click to ok that it has finished just a minute or two with my small amount of data click to restart wait a long time for it to restart tap to get past the owner data screen enter the password then pop the restore card out reinstall the map card wait while it reads it then i m good to go i can t do it while i m driving of course so if the unit resets on its own i just go with the complete lack of contacts and without the unit knowing where home is which means i have to type it or other locations into the where to dialogue the unit defaults to directions instead of north is always up which is confusing for me as i can t look at the screen and out my window and make immediate sense of where i am vis a vis the map i m sure this is my shortcoming and i then have to remember how to navigate the menu to the setting for north is up which i can t do while driving it also defaults to different displays for day and night the night display uses a dark background and i have found that the menus for the windows programs use a transparent background with black text so i can t read the menu selections against the dark display and the unit will not save my preference for using day at all times if i lose power or the unit resets when i start the car or sometimes when i put it in the cradle on the contacts database the unit assumes all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe kansas it also formats all numbers as us numbers i have a few overseas numbers and they are crammed into the xxx xxx xxxx format even though they are longer and don t start with an area code in the calendar if i have meetings scheduled outside my time zone i enter them at the time they re scheduled then when i get there i have the option of choosing the visited time zone and all the times are screwed up as the unit assumes all times entered are for my original time zone so i never use the visited time zone feature and the unit assumes i m still in my home zone wherever i may travel i have not found a way to have it tell me how to get to places that have no street address but for which i have the lat long coordinates i camp in places that are off main roads and trying to move the map around gets to be burdensome at the scale necessary to show unpaved roads i quickly lose where i am and have to zoom out which loses the road on the whole the directions part of the is excellent it gives good directions has reasonably up to date maps and lets you find stores restaurants gas stations hotels and the like in your area and it provides addresses and phone numbers so you can call ahead for information and reservations on the whole using the device is too aggravating to make it a keeper after a year of use i can t put up with it anymore i ll take garmin s word that this is all a shortcoming of windows mobile and not garmin s fault but i can t put up with it anymore i ll switch to magellan or tomtom or some other unit that isn t windows based and that doesn t completely lose its mind when the battery runs down doesn t randomly do a hard reset doesn t randomly set the brightness to zero and doesn t assume all phone numbers start with the area code to olathe kansas maybe another manufacturer will let me import pois and way points from other people s files
0,it is almost impossible to get a clear picture on any channel and the sound quality is poor buying this handheld was a big mistake
0,i admit that i m far from an expert on digital cameras i did take over photographs with cameras for over years i purchased a powershot in july of it wasn t too long before the zoom on the cameras lens wouldn t work i contacted canon over this and can you believe this company had the audacity to charge me for shipping their faulty camera back to them i can understand them saying we ll charge you at first but once we establish that the fault is due to us we ll then reimburse you back i enclosed a type written letter with the camera asking that canon contact me when they received my camera in the mail and i also asked that they contact me when it was being shipped back i also emailed them the same request neither of my wishes was ever fulfilled on canon s behalf that in itself was enough for me and i ve been bitter about that ever since i ve also told every person that i ve met who wanted to buy a digital camera about this incident i m pleased to say i ve steered most away from this company what else can i say about this camera this camera is slow at times after its taken a picture i ve missed out on some good shots due to this it eats batteries like there s no tomorrow so one must have rechargeable aa s to even make this camera worth its while i ve not used other digital cameras so maybe they are all this way but if i take a minute movie with this camera in my home during the day and go outside most things outside are very white almost like looking at an infra red photograph when filming outside when one goes inside during the day everything is dark like i said maybe all digital cameras are this way i wouldn t recommend this camera or anything that canon makes if you want my personal opinion think about that you have to pay the shipping for a camera that s barely a few months old and still under warranty that s disgusting that s all i have to say there should be a zero for this not a star
1,kurzweil opens with a very heartfelt recounting of his return to judaism and his personal path which led him to rabbi steinsaltz from there the chapters fly by effortlessly partitioned in small chapters of which each is it s own midrash giving each of us something to reflect upon and discuss this is for everyone who wants to know more about not only steinsaltz but the beauty and wisdom of the jewish faith
0,this weight bench is too short and is almost impossible to use in a completely horizontal postion you would have to be a little kid for it to work after working along time to put it together i found neither me nor my kid could use it effectively
1,this was part of the marvel action hour along with iron man at first the animation and dialogue was pretty bad and they had annoying supporting characters but the series remain true to the comics the story lines they took from the comics were done very well like episodes involving the silver surfer
1,good product easy to use good price like having the neoprene cover over the metal makes it softer to hold
1,this particular cam has some issues but as long as you understand how to configure it it will blow you away i ve heard people complain about dlink and they do have to get on the ball with tech support autually their tech support sucks but i don t need them this is not a plug and play device so study the online manual carefully when you actually learn how to use it you won t buy anything else for the price if you are tech savey you will really enjoy the product i have nine cams installed at three locations using their ip software you can view upto at once the reason i m back on this site is because i need to order two more i did have to return my first one but it was a pre production unit and somebody forgot a timing gear dlink sent my replacement direct the oldest cam has worked flawlessly for a year now one last comment the next closent cam is a panasonic but for equal quality you will pay more with less features
1,this product is amazing not only did i get a very good tasting product but i also got a hand written note and a free sample of candy made fresh by das foods i also purchased the lava salt with the same reaction i would recomend this product to anyone who is looking for one of those different seasonings for their food
1,gunstories by beth atkin is a book that should be mandatory reading for all students and discussed with parents teachers and friends young people discuss guns in a positive light and a negative light as with any subject it is only with education and knowledge that a change can be made i definitely recommend this book and hope that it can be a fixture in all elementary middle and high schools p s if you are a school librarian order a copy shelley henderson nv a fascinating look at a difficult topic many viewpoints are presented the book is fair and balanced but the stories of gun violence just naturally have more impact than those of kids who enjoy range shooting the dichotomy between rural and urban viewpoints is striking the wonderful photography really adds to the text recommended diane cedar rapids ia despite the fact that i m not really in support of guns it is nice to read a book on such a controversial topic that does not carry a political agenda it s not your typical pro con book either it gives actual perspectives from real life people teen people who just want to tell it like it is amy fort worth tx
0,the product doesnt appear as is shown on the picture at all its not red and its too small to even imagine i knew it would appear bit smaller than on picture but this is beyond my imagination the chain can break any time and the stud gosh i cant even see it now i m gonna check if its really gold or not dont buy this product save yourself the money
1,i purchase this lens for the digital rebel xt body i also purchased through amazon so far the lens has performed as expected it is solid and well built sticks slightly when zooming through images are crisp and focus is sharp working at can be a challenge without using a mono or tripod shooting a bird in flight at is a trick overall good lens for if you have more money then a lens with image stabilization is would be the way to go

0,this portable tv sounds great except they made a few mistakes in the design they don t tell you that there is no antennea nor that the tv will not work without an antennea the portable dvd player is great the tv is horrible when we did get an antennea the tv worked but we went to numerous stores and the all the antenneas we found were big and bulky plus had to be hooked then unhooked when we wanted to put the unit away without an antennea sticking out to get broken don t buy this for the tv we ended up purchasing a different product that had the antennea built in this one was a total waste of money
1,more like so half of this album is excellent the rest is filler but due to times like these all my life disenchanted lullaby the intro irritates me but it gets better have it all kinda sappy but i love the intro low have you seen the video and overdrive again kinda sappy but there s something about it i love the album is pretty enjoyable it doesn t compare to the first three but it has its moments the riffs are slightly heavier most songs are pretty upbeat times like these is an instant classic with awesome lyrics while all my life rocks harder than pretty much all previous songs kinda sucks how the best songs are were singles but if they had released other songs no one would buy the album mind you my friend loves burn away so listen to the previews and make your own mind up
1,its a little hard to adjust but its definitely worth it we ve used it on our double jogging stroller as well as our double umbrella stroller folds away easily and doesn t take up a lot of space i also love the pockets on the sides where i can store my keys phone water bottle etc
0,the setting of this book is beautiful exotic and interesting the author unfortunately does nothing to take advantage of this i am shocked that this book could possibly have won a national book award it must mean that either the award itself is meaningless or that there were some truly dreadful books out that year which i doubt the topic of this book could have been more ably handled by just about anyone else as far as i am concerned i can t imagine it being done worse tuck s writing style short vignettes or episodes one after another is terribly ineffective and disjointed i felt completely detached from all of the characters i didn t feel like i gained any understanding of who they were and was unmoved when they died or otherwise encountered tragedies another thing that completely irritated me were tuck s sexual references throughout the novel tuck would end her lame vignettes with one or two sentences mentioning some crass sexual encounter a finger inserted in an unmentionable place or a character participating in a masturbating contest for example these sentences seem to be thrown in just to shock or perhaps to intrigue the reader all they did was gross me out they were written in such a way that they seemed to have been written by a teenage boy not an adult woman trying to tell a compelling story i don t know what tuck was trying to do in this novel i think she has failed to write anything that succeeds on any level it is not entertaining it is not profound it is not educational it is not beautiful at only pages i can t say it was even a quick read utterly forgettable once you get past the irritation of having wasted your time reading it
1,this is a great way to try the teas before you buy them in any type of quantity the pot brews about cups of tea i don t drink the tea often i prefer to have it as an infrequent treat to keep the experience special i will update my review as i try the different teas the dragon lily tasted wonderful but the flower was really ugly however i did buy a box of this tea and when i brewed it the flower was more colorful and appealing i was able to steep this flower times for cups although i admit that the last three cups didn t have as strong a flavor starlight rose was disappointing the flower never changed appearace just got bigger the flavor was strong and left my mouth feeling pasty flower jewel lavender dream emerald sun jade fortune jasmine pearls unwind to become long thin leaves the scent is heavenly the taste is not quite as dramatic but still good i used approximately pearl for each cup of tea to brew it pearls per pot black beauty midnight peony

0,didn t like this product all of the actual scrub salt is at the top and minimal felt like i would ve been better off mixing some olive oil and actual sea salt to give myself a good scrub it did smell nice and i like the packaging
0,i said i was going to be honest in all reviews and yes i kinda clunkered on this one i hate this cd simply put they can t sing and the songs are boring i m sorry i bought this cd and other people might not like me saying that but it s my opinion i listen to power metal extensively and there is much better stuff out there like symphony x nightwish or sonata artica don t buy this though you might like it i d definitely listen to it first
0,holds the phone well for a few months untils the clips on the side loosen and break after that happens the phone falls out pretty easily and you realize the bunces and still keeps working i ended up replacing it with a different holster from rim that has a magnetic clasp the replcement works great
1,i chose this watch because of the stunning and currently very fashionable rolex green colour and because the price was right so how does it stack up nice bright yellow display box to keep it safe during shipping and storage watch was well protected as well with clear plastic wrap over all surfaces the quality and finish are excellent and the watch is easy to set for day and date it has a clear back so you can see the motion spring mechanism at work pretty cool clasp and strap are well finished and work well rotating bezel lines up perfectly at o clock nice sweeping hand movement great look and great value

1,i have no complaints i have had this camera for over a year and a half and it has been reliable fast and gives me crisp quality photos the only option i wish this camera had was a better stabilization mode to prevent blurred pictures but the software edits the blur without reducing the quality blurry pictures are not a problem as long as you know how to aim and shoot everyone loves playing with my camera because it has many cool features to make your photos fun i highly recommend this camera especially to beginners or for those who just want a simple camera that can capture those precious moments with high quality photos excellent camera overall
0,this could have been one of the best films of the s all of the components are there ford gives the best acting of his career the production is elegant and holds up as often breathtaking even by today s standards two things however really bring this movie down the major negative here i believe is polanski s insistence on starring emmanuelle seigner this is one of the sexiest women i have ever seen grace a film but it is the understatement of the year to say that she can t act at all in fact i think that she might have just about turned in the worst acting performance i have ever seen in this film and it totally destroys ford s performance when the film was over i thought about it and came to the conclusion that there is really two halves here the first half is dynamite the second with seigner is a totally different beast your average stupid kid thriller watch this film and dare contradict my statement here get beyond her obvious good looks and tell me she just was not meant for this part it s so bad that ford fades into the background in any scene that she was also in ok the second negative in this film are these two agents that keep popping up there is no explanation ever given as to how they knew where ford and seigner would be time and time again it really ruins what could have been a very nicely done and subtle plot they were never needed and muddle an otherwise great story i am really kind of mad with polanski here he destroyed what could have been one of the better films he has made and this statement comes from one who worships the ground polanski walks on
0,this is a very cute bouncer chair however i feel it was poorly designed it sets the baby almost laying down so it is difficult to play with the toys in addition our baby has acid reflux and it was not a good chair for him because it sets him back too far we had to find one that set more upright

0,nothing not even a trailer what a wasted opportunity for a commentary by west who does do them he did one for when a stranger calls or a retrospective featurette all you do get with this extended version is additional dialogue between cusack s character and a female law enforcement officer in a hanger footage of a prison riot during the opening credits montage and a few more graphic shots of hapless inmates being killed during the course of the movie

1,reincarnate can be a hard shampoo to get used to especially if you re not already using lush products it doesn t sud up much and feels a little bit muddy and grainy don t fret though it will certainly clean your hair and will also leave it smelling like wonderful spices almost as good as arabian bright the highlights are not something that come with one or two washings but with many many washings and they are very subtle but there the only reason i don t give this product five stars is that it was not as conditioning as it states it is and i needed to use another conditioning product with it
1,it doesnt quit dark circles but helps against wrinkles while it is on your face
0,after the safe arrived my son was very excited to use his new toy unfortunately one of the key features the toy promises setting your own secret code combination to open the safe does not function neither he or any of the three adults in the room were able to reprogram it to the numbers he chose he was very sad about it but after waiting so long for it to arrive by mail would not return it since it arrived at my home i have researched other reviews at amazon you already have product reviews stating the same complaint this is not an inexpensive toy and it does not work as promised it should be taken off your item list until it has been fixed as it stands amazon is selling a low quality item to young children and parents who are very disappointed

1,nizoral anti dandruff shampoo seems to be a very good product i noticed a difference the first time i used it there was no residue on my scalp and my flakiness was greatly reduced it produced a very rich lather also the only thing i didn t like about it was the possibility that i d have an allergic reaction to the ingredients but the instructions didn t tell which ingredients might make this happen i myself am sensitive to many products and didn t have any reaction to the ingredients of the shampoo i would recommend this product to others

0,we had the diaper dekor plus and it seems that i m the only reviewer here so far that has had a terrible problem with it having a bad smell the first couple of months weren t bad but after about months or so it really started to smell bad this horrid smell only got worse with use as time went on we tried everything we could think of to get rid of the smell letting it air out outside cleaning it with bleach or some other cleaning solution putting baking soda in the bottom of the liner and even leaving a small box of baking soda inside the can but outside the liner letting it soak in a bathtub of soap and water we even bought some scented disc type things can be purchased at babies r us that you can put in the bottom and it only made the smell worse we continued to use it but frequently had to let it air out or spray it with lysol or something eventually we used it less and less and we just threw it away when we moved to a new home a few weeks ago we d had it for almost years we knew there was no way anyone else would want to use it with that smell and knowing they couldn t get rid of it it was a real shame because aside from the smell it was a great product
0,i bought this just to try something new i love peach and mango flavors and this sounded very good i do think it s a good drink but whether or not i am able to think better because of it is up for debate i doubt i ll buy these again if only because they are quite pricey small cans the liquid volume is only a smidgeon over one cup for over twenty dollars it s close enough to a can to make it not cost effective to get vitamins and minerals this way the taste is good but i have had lots of other healthy drinks that taste just as good for less than a third of the cost but now i know this drink is not for me if you like good tasting nutritious drinks that cost a lot of money this one s for you

0,i agree with all the other reviewers nice quality recording for its time considering it was in the vaults for decades great playing from all concerned except the cursed drummer i cannot imagine what poor jerry gemmot went through with that drummer he should have been dismissed immediately or shot it would have sounded better without him gawd awful spoils the whole dang thing any way i cannot listen to this anymore without getting uncomfortable so it s back to soul of a man re kooperation live adventures super session and kooper sessions with shuggie
0,i really wanted to like this but i find that my skin looked ashen and orangey after a couple of hours when i went back to get a lighter color it did the same i think there s just too much yellow in this foundation and considering it s oil free it didn t really keep the oils at bay and practically slid off my skin by midday i would suggest trying this first and wear it all day to see if it turns orange on you or if you re looking for a similar oil free foundation i would highly recommend laura mercier oil free or chanel dpf
0,we bought this thinking the suctions would keep the darn thing on boy were we wrong the suction cups are so weak that my cat jumped onto the toilet seat and knocked it over save your money
0,i don t understand what the people in charge of producing the wiz as a film could get by joining the former big names of diana ross michael jackson richard pryor and lena horne in this trashy picture the music soundtrack is by far much better than the movie itself i have lately become a great soul music fan so i recommend to get the soundtrack album and enjoy it considering it just as a very imaginative soul music work not keeping in mind that it s a movie soundtrack in such manner you will enjoy it more
1,i bought this scanner as a xmas gift for my dad he s tested it on his gm pickup and my mom s pontiac it sync d up with the cars and worked as advertised the only reason why i don t give it stars is we haven t had to use it for any serious diagnostic purposes yet and that s why i bought it

1,i really did some research on digital cameras even tried out a sony but the canon brand is by far one of the best i don t have to do a lot of thinking when snapping a picture with this camera it does most of the work i like to be able to think about the compostion of my photo and not iso aperature and all that jazz the settings make it so easy and the color of the photos turn out so true the digital zoom is great and will even alert you if the picture will come out blurry there are so many features on this camera too many to list i even found a great deal at best buy on a gig memory card i get over photos with a high resolution it takes alkaline batteries but i bought rechargeable ones and one charge lasts a long time i am sooo happy with this camera i take it with me everywhere even a couple of days to work

1,this album has pure energy pure lyrics pure beats everything went right in this soundtrack public enemy seldomly puts out any bad albums the title song in this album he got game was a pretty weak song the beats were nice though but this song leans a little towards the blues and jazz catogorie that was the only song that i disliked out of tracks the album starts off with the song ressurection that track was so beautifully produced it sounded way beyond public enemy s music masta killa dropped a verse that was so so tight track wit krs one was one of the best number had a cool beat the rest of the tracks were just public enemy style this is a great album for a public enemy fan
0,i was completely prepared to give this tripod a five star review it s lightweight but sturdy easy to assemble and disassemble and very adjustable i used it to tape a church service and sat it next to me in the pew with its legs retracted like a short tripod and it was wonderful it s also nicely finished and when you collapse the tripod and tighten its knobs it stays together and doesn t flop around while you re toting it unfortunately that evening i had trouble docking our new sony camcorder and when i looked at the bottom of the camcorder i saw that the stabilizing pin from the tripod quick release had broken off in the camera to my great relief i was able to pull out the pin with no trouble but the angst factor was pretty high there for a couple of minutes i was very careful attaching and removing the camera from the tripod so this is not consumer error i can t keep the quick release plate permanently attached because then i can t dock the camcorder bad on sony there but still your mileage may vary but this tripod is going back to amazon and i ll be shopping for another brand
0,why because it underestimates our intelligence it has nothing to do with natural health it has to do with advertisements it is empty completelly more it looks like a woman magazine but i believe that a clever woman would feel like i feel now angry i paid for something that i believed but it is not ok we make mistakes
0,whenever i m asked what is the worst movie i have ever seen i quickly respond cabin boy it is like a long meandering and entirely pointless joke one might hear from an obnoxious coworker i would describe the plot but there is none i watched the entire movie waiting for the punchline but it never came it was written by a former staff writer for david letterman which is the only conceivable reason that letterman would agree to appear in such a monstrosity even he later joked about how awful the movie was chris elliott plays the only character he has ever played the annoyimg dumb guy loser his limited acting talent combined with a nonsensical plot unfunny dialogue and an absurd tendency to confuse silliness with humor truly make cabin boy a cinematic experience everyone should miss
0,when i bought this i had gotten sick of using a mop and bucket and really needed something faster it doesn t cut it for a few reasons solution left a streaky dull floor mop glo with water works much better bottle only lasted times for a very small kitchen need to put batteries in the device something i didn t realize when i bought it not cleaner than a mop if you have a heavy traffic floor like i do you d have to use about clean pads on the floor to keep from pushing dirt around a mop at least can be rinsed bottle is impossible to refill i might have stuck with it if i could have replaced the solution with a water mop glo mix but they have the bottle fixed so you can t sigh i m actually considering spending the for a scooba we have a roomba vac for the living room and it is a dream if you want something fast stick with swiffer wet no batteries no solution to refill
0,i was again disappointed as this did not make me feel fresh in fact if you mix it with the dirt in your hair it causes some type of nasty reaction and your hair becomes sticky and gooey nothing fresh about it
0,a sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise but this one doesn t also the construction leaves something to be desired it s very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks where the seams are sewn i bought two after trying them several times i gave up and sent them to charity don t bother
0,i bought this product for my old at first i thought it would help her go to the bathroom when we went out but when she sits on the seat she has been pinched a few times at first she didn t want to sit on it again she cried when i took her to the bathroom but i told her i would sit her on it i would lift her off since i have been doing this she hasn t been pinched but it took me a while for her to trust me if you buy this product you have to be very careful or your child will get pinched
1,originally looked to buy the wasa light rye but it was out of stock so bought the sourdough rye and multi grain instead and glad i did because they have broadened my selection of favorite wasa brand crispbreads and while i normally avoid products with yeast i feel that the toasty crispness of the multi grain has neutralized any negative aspects that yeast is a negative is my story and i m stickin to it that may be derived from containing yeast as for varied uses it s equally great for strengthening the teeth and should be a great weight loss adjunct because it is not easy to eat fast and requires some mastication which should satisfy the need to have eaten when eaten as a cracker or mechanically grinding to a pouder for use to coat salmon coquettes oh some more good news is that moths will try to eat through a package of rye crispbreads which means what s inside is edible for humans too i keep mine stored in the freezer because it is so valuable should be a good nutrient source in case of prolonged emergencies as well still my preference among all the wasa crispbreads is the light rye only ingredients rye flour and sea salt just give me the simple life without the two accompanying airheads that is
1,i ve had my snap on case for about a month and i love it the magenta color looks very much like the original pink razr phone the bottom case could fit a little more snugly but it s not a problem
0,why is it ever time you want something bad enough it usually turns out bad after the wonderful quinn trilogy fans including me begged and begged for nora roberts to write seth s story after all we journeyed with seth through we wanted to see him fall in love nora roberts repeatedly said she would not write one but us fans kept on begging for it and were excited when she finally gave in and wrote it and we got chesapeake blue reading it you know you should be grateful because you wanted seth s story but this wasn t what i and my fellow nr fans friends wanted first of all i wanted the heroine to be aubrey after their beautiful friendship in the quinn trilogy i expected her to be seth s love interest but i tried to keep an open mind after all i loved anna grace and sybill but dru whitcomb banks was a completely let down all she did was whine and complain about her life which were minor compared to what cam ethan philip and seth experienced as children seth becoming an artist was a surprise too i expected him to join the family business and design boats the gloria blackmailing him was a very thin and bad plotline there s no reason gloria would want to contact him considering all the warrents for her and that seth wouldn t tell his family considering the quinn brothers and wives worked their so hard to keep him away from her i closed this book vowing never to request beg or petition an author to write a book when they say they don t want to because this is what you get
0,i bought this vehicle for my son we have been through already they do not work the controller is not made very well the two cars we bought did not respond the first one you had to put the controller right up to the car to make it work the other car would only go forward and we tried this with brand new batteries and the charger pack we bought definitely a disappointment
1,ok i eat a lot of protein fiber bars and most taste like cardboard or something worse this bar is the best i eat it for breakfast lunch or as dessert after dinner the texture reminds me of a chewy rice crispy treat seriously love it
0,this glove will simply temporarily mask some of the symtoms associated with carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive strain injuries and make problems worse since one still has full function of his her hands when using this you are further injuring your hands by using the flexor muscles in grabing and squeezing when using these gloves your hands and wrist will feel better at first but once the glove is removed your problems will persist and get progressively worse
0,i like to have natural sounds or some type of yoga style music while i m either practicing yoga or just trying to relax this cd just didn t fit there are a few ok songs but the rest of it is either too fast upbeat or there s too much talking chanting i found myself distracted when i put this cd on
1,my local sam s club discontinued the nature s path maple and brown sugar instant oatmeal due to lack of sales i was bummed and did not want to resort to the highly processed quaker instants ick not to mention i m tired of all the junk ingredients in mainstream food nowadays then i remembered amazon selling a lot of easily shippable bulk foods including organics the nature s path oatmeal absorbs water much better and the texture is heartier than other leading brands it is also very flavorful the variety pack is nice since i used to tire of the sam s club selection of maple and brown sugar only my kids love steel cut oats with a little pure maple syrup but it s not the most convenient breakfast food the nature s path instant oatmeal is quick and easy during the busy weekday mornings and best of all i can understand the ingredients label without having to take a chemistry refresher class i m very satisfied with my first organic purchase from amazon we now peruse the selection of organic foods on amazon before making local purchases

0,when i first got this watch i was thrilled it has a nice movement and has very powerful illumination the problem started when i went to the store to get the bracelet sized for my puny wrists the guy asked me if this was some kind of overstock or gray market because the pins in the bracelet popped out like nothing at the time i thought he was just po d because i didnt buy the watch at the store as soon as i was home though the bracelet fell apart what a piece of junk i regret buying this watch and i advise against it
1,this book was an amazing account of the spanish in north america many of the themes that occur during this time period occur in almost every time period and place dealing with religious intolerence slavery econmoy unification and the influence of all people on one another this book captures everything themes this book expresses about this time period are even more evident in today s information age as more people from different backgrounds and heritages come together on the internet this was a good book to read and made it easy to see the flaws and benefits of the past showing what not to and what to repeat
0,ordered items but this one did not arrive said wrong address but all others came lost in shipping sounds like a run around
0,i ve heard this book on tape which poor writing aside is more horrifying to actually hear o reilly read in his own voice the gratuitous sex which can only be appreciated if you also enjoy harrassing others with phone sex and falafels is enough to turn anyone off but that voice narrating the suggestive scenes is waaaay too much to endure a sad sad example of narcissism at it s very worst
0,ok maybe that s a bit strong but this is hands down our most hated toy by the adults and the kids are plenty frustrated too we received it as a gift and wow whoever would pay for this is crazy our son is nearly five needs help to load the truck which has to be loaded fully to work without jamming a time consuming procedure since the dominoes have to be loaded one at a time the dominoes themselves are also almost too lightweight to stand well on end and are prone to easy collapse after the initial newness wears off this toy is going to disappear and that s something i ve never even contemplated before
0,i was very displeased when i received the feuilles de brick i had to cater for an important client all the ingredients ready to be assembled in the feuilles and due to their dryness the feuilles de brick i could not bake my desserts

1,this is an excellent magazine there are very few magazines that i choose to read cover to cover this is one of the few the photographs illustrate the text and accompany it just right they are gorgeous the writing is clear and concise and interesting the topics they write on include history travel historical objects animals places and so on one monthly article that has fast become my favorite is about photographers each month they highlight a famous picture and the photographer who took it and discuss what made that picture important they tell a little bit about the photographer and the person who was photographed if it is a person this is a fascinating magazine and well worth the money enjoy

0,i just finished seeing the movie and loved the song at the end and immediately started looking up amazon for this song thanks to melania for pointing out the song title at the end i realize this cd is just a soundtrack but typically most soundtracks also include the ending songs it is just plain dumb not to include the best music in this cd my vote do not buy this cd the soundtrack is all pretty generic stuff but get the ending title song if you can it s great
0,the bag is nice and everything but the zipper does not come down very far and makes the bag tough to get into also my feet got cold because of the zippered area not really sure i understand why it s there my feet never get warm usually cold i liek the material and the look also seemed to keep me warm on a deg night
1,compared to the conair i have used for the past seven years or so it sounded incredibly loud and high pitched when i first turned it on but you may have a high pitched blow dryer now compared to my old conair and won t notice a difference it doesn t have a cold air feature which many women use regularly to either finish off their styling or to cause less damage to the hair or like me in the summer when the option of switching from hot to cold is preferable these two drawbacks especially having only the hot at high or low setting is why i give it four out of five instead of five out of five star rating pluses price for it can t be beat for the frugal shopper efficiency it blowdries my hair a bit faster than the conair did though i don t understand the science behind that appearance it s cute and compact weight a toddler could wield this blow dryer with ease carrying ease small enough to fit neatly in just about any drawer or a crammed gym bag under the sink et cetera i haven t had this long enough to rate how durable it is so i hope someone who s owned one for at least a year comes on to write it s still going strong
0,i have used these containers and the milk escaped by the time i reached home
1,one of the things i like about this book for young readers is that the same vocabulary words are repeated throughout the series so that the kids can build on what they learned in one book while they re reading the next at first i was disappointed with the series since i didn t think it did justice to the little house series that i treasured myself as a girl after a few reads however i see that the magic of laura ingalls wilder s stories shines through in this series with renee graef s illustrations how else do you explain to a four year old what a log cabin is really like i am surprised how many how and why questions this series has provoked regarding this book in particular my daughter asked about a million questions about the maple syrup making process
1,i am ordering copies for all middle school principals and the two assistant principals leading two middle school programs in the milwaukee public schools system we will use wheatley s book as the primary resource for our professional growth at our mps middle school principals collaborative institute august we are not just concerned with reform we seek renewal as well wheatley provides the basis she notes that einstein said that a problem cannot be solved from the same consciousness that created it the entire book is a marvelous exploration of this philosophy
1,it feels so strange describing this game to people who have never heard of it before yeah you play as this tiny little prince and your father the king of all cosmos got drunk one night and destroyed all the stars in the sky your job is to go around the earth with this psychedelic sticky thing called a katamari and roll stuff up into a big ball really that s all you do just roll as much stuff as possible into a massive ball and if it s big enough your gigantic well endowed father will shoot it up into the sky to become a new star and uh that s the plot wtf yeah you just gotta play it and that s the best advice i can give what exactly is it that attracts me to such a bizarre game perhaps it satisfies some strange compulsion of mine to just roll things up into a ball i dunno it s just plain fun the controls are very simple you only use the left and right analog sticks to navigate through your brightly colored exceedingly cluttered environment what really adds to the enjoyment of this game is the sound every object you pick up lets out a unique sound as it s unapologetically absorbed into your ball of junk and it s quite amusing furthermore the soundtrack is catchy and upbeat and you re sure to get the songs stuck in your head for hours days weeks months lol i also love the fact that this title is enjoyable and playable for both gamers and non gamers alike the controls are quick to pick up and simple objective is easy to jump into truly this game is just off the wall fun and if you re willing to try something unique with a healthy dose of craziness give this game a roll
1,the subject provided a good historical perspective on japan s renaissance period post civil wars and pre westernization in many respects musashi a ronin represents japan s search for an identity a country ruled by military might in the form of the shogun yet keeping an emperor who they revered as a god a god without power this sword saint was a man of great prowess with a sword of wood or of steel he was also an artist a lithographer and an author yet he was masterless masterless in a time when righteous was measured in a retainer s devotion to his master he was his own master in a time when japan had no voice serving all without righteous it would take an other two hundred and fifty years or so and a world war to release the spirit of the samurai that being honor amongst personal sacrifice a picture painted in the person of miyamoto musashi struggle for perfection and personal mastery of his profession master of the sword

0,at least this author mentions the mockery strategy martha mdiddy tried to use to fog the public the real issue of whether martha mdiddy committed the crimes and lack of an effort to encourage an answer to the question did martha stewart lie demonstrates some complacency is it this complacency martha mdiddy and her pr team try to encourage and promote is it the greyness of white collar crime that martha mdiddy was trying to play on is society the ultimate judge about a person s guilt or innocence if so what has martha mdiddy been judged be thoughtful shaw

1,at least as far as the magazine itself is concerned but cardplayer is a vastly superior website with up to the minute tournament coverage email and a ton of other things all in online is definitely worth checking out on a regular basis however i just read two hardcopy issues when i was in vegas and i liked the features pro coverage interviews and book reviews should you be miles from a nearby cardroom and have a jones to advance your knowledge then you can do so rather passively by reading a publication that closely follows the pro game
0,when my daughter was tiny she enjoyed being in this sling on the one or two occasions i managed to endure the discomfort of wearing it for more than two minutes the cotton fabric doesn t offer much support for the baby s weight and i found it became uncomfortable very quickly it also didn t feel as secure as some of the padded over the shoulder style slings i actually was afraid not to keep an arm on my baby at all times which defeats the purpose
0,i wouldn t even give this toy one star if i wasn t forced to mattel should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a product with s graphics and even worse sound it sounds like my husband s casio watch the only thing they did well with this product is market it i gave this to my daughter from santa and i am still going to return it

0,more time could have been spent in ney york city for this movie like with friday the part seven the new blood all of the good gore scenes were cut out but still this is a terrible movie and i am willing to bet that not even gore will help it be better than part five

0,i was so disappointed with this cd at least of the songs were recorded from very old albums scratches and all they were so bad i play two of the songs over and over the only two i liked when i read the other reviews and there was mention of leaving out some of the songs i assumed that they meant doubles of the same song i was wrong i don t know why they had to add the scratchy music a filler i would quickly skip to another song only to have to skip many times
1,what more can you say it s durable it s fun it folds so nicely and be put away good buy
1,i have been using this razor for about years now probably as long as they have been out they may be pricey but well worth it i used to use disposables and nicked cut my legs almost every time i switched to these and have maybe nicked my legs very little it is so quick and easy to use and my legs are much smoother than they ever were with disposables and shaving creams they do only last for shaves but if you figure in the price of disposables and shaving cream it s probably not that much more expensive
0,every time we used this scale it gave a drastically different weight we returned it to amazon probably the first time we ve ever had to do that for the price it should at least work also in only the days we had it a large chip came off the corner it earns two stars for looking great i would not recommend it

1,i like this scent my first thought was pears before reading what the notes were yes apples this is not a hardcore apple scent but enough so very fresh and sweet but not too sweet crisp and spring like a hint a tiny hint of dandelions and a tiny bit of rose just a tiny bit my husband likes this scent on me as well which is saying a lot he hates roses and foody scents but still likes this
1,my sony has great low light capability lux but eventually you will need extra light using your software to lighten dark shots will likely reveal some degree of graininess no matter which camera you use i m so glad i bought it used it for my birthday party though the overhead light was good dark corners of the room require more light if you consider yourself advanced semi pro or a pro videographer you must have a light my only major beef is it runs at either or watts no variable for or it is worth getting a long life battery like the np independent power source battery is a plus but no outlet plug adaptor that i know of
1,we ordered this program only two weeks before moving to bogota columbia for a two year tour however the spanish rosetta stone taught was much higher level than the survival spanish we needed when we arrived overall we are learning the language and it is a great program wish we would have bought it or months before departing
1,this film came out in and i saw it in its original full length version about and min executives from columbia pictures were there it was the premeire and they were groaning and at the intermission fights broke out verbal and ushers passed among them and myself and everyone else with soundtrack albums the executives left the theatre and scaled the albums across columbus circle in boston and i and a few friends retrieved them and had quite a few for free we returned to the film and i have always loved this crazy redition of lost horizon the miscasting the terrible sets the odd ball music for the story the dubbed liv ullmann the dance routines of olivia hussey all of it you cannot find a musical like it or a soundtrack like it columbia execs were unimaginative they should have believed in this film the next day after this premeire in boston new york etc simultaneous i suppose the film was cut the posters were taken down there was a ton of material to buy t shirts dolls posters of all sizes bath towels with the poster on them records of the sd tk of course and small pop up sets of the entire film it was to be a massive hit in two days time all of the paraphanalia was removed and the posters said last two weeks and in two weeks the whole thing disappeared but many people came to see it lines of people and when they heard it had been cut they gave up and in two weeks everyone said farewell to this film i have many treasures from that opening nite and now i have the cd of the sound track anyone who loves movie magic or madness has to see and hear this film it is unique enjoy this soundtrack and get your hands on a dvd they are out there
1,i ordered this headset in silver webtreo sent out white but said that even though it appears white it really is silver we argued about the color and i finally convinced them that samsung makes white silver red and black it took almost a month to get resolved but i finally have the silver headset that i ordered it is very small light and easy to use there are different size earpieces for a better fit the headset gets stars webtreo only gets star i wouldn t order any products from them again
1,i ve read the new yorker since and though it seemed a better magazine then it is still a very good magazine now as magazines go it may even be one of the best this nation has ever published for good writing reporting cartoons and opinion one can do no better than this well known magazine and their occasional special issues offer abundant pages that double their weekly issue i don t believe any issue in all the years i ve read it hasn t had at least a couple items of interest with some of the issues being read from front cover to back try a copy it might just be for you semper fi
0,this mediocre effort is disappointingly unfunny considering the comedic caliber of its two stars billy crystal and robin williams i was expecting a laugh riot but that s not what this is it s not their fault it s the scriptwriter s i guess maybe it was just one of those scripts that read funny on paper but that humor just didn t translate to the screen despite the best efforts of mssrs crystal and williams they deserve better and so do we
0,this dvd is very cheesy and i am sorry i bought it
1,touchstone is one of the better magazines journals to discuss and debate the meaning of the mind and heart in the contemporary world by standing on the shoulders of those who have struggled with this perennial question in the past the editors numerous in number are orthodox roman and protestant christians who take seriously the creeds and scriptures of the church in other words they realize that tradition is the glue that holds the church together and by extension sanitizes and sanctifies culture first things is also an excellent journal that you will want to check out as well enjoy
1,it is a little bit clumsey when i go to it instead of my cursor being in the space where i write the word for a definition i have to place it there and that takes time the first one of these electronic dictionaries i had about years ago was fabulous it was called deluxe and had everything but my computer outgrew ot amd the makers have never bothered to bring it up to date and offer it again
1,i bought this product for my husband he tried it out on one of the hottest days sunny and degrees he is very particular on how he washes our vehicles and it usually takes a few hours this really works not only did it cut the time it takes to wash the cars but it is amazing it looked as if he did the vehicles the old way there were no streaks the truck looked like it was polished unbelievable i would recommend this product to anyone buy it
0,this adapter vignettes badly at wide angle settings on my so much so that the field of view for which there is no vignetting is essentially identical to that without the adapter at the widest setting of the regular lens thus absolutely nothing has been gained by using the adapter canon normally a responsible firm with many excellent products is beneath contempt in marketing this lens i called canon customer service and spoke with a sympathetic representative who took the matter up with someone else the outcome was that they admit that there is very little increase in the non vignetted field of view by using this adapter she said she would put my comments on a company internal problem compilation called customer voice i can only hope it reaches someone high enough to do some good
1,i have only recently become a country music fan i wasn t sure i would like faith hill but this was the first cd of hers i purchased from the very first song this kiss i was instantly drawn into her music what i love about her songs is that they are so real you give me love is so real and so strong it s nice to hear a song that a woman sings about a man who is crying for a change the secret of life has taken some getting used to it is not my absolute favorite on the cd me is the song that means the most to me since i have experienced trying to change for someone else in a relationship and i love you is a heart jerker for those who have loved someone from afar she has a big voice and she nails each song on this cd give it a try
0,like other users i found the light output substandard i bought it specifically as an emergency light source if i really needed this light there really would be an emergency absolutely pathetic
0,i purchased this product in may however it is not working this year april i replaced the watt bulb but it still does not work this is not a product worth the expense i would say that for less that months of use would be a high enough price to pay
0,this may be an acceptable ramp for a child but an older child would laugh at this one i was embarrassed to even give it to my son
1,if you are a hardcore family guy fan like me i am actually one of the few people that watched family guy when it was originally on the air you will not be disappointed with this monopoly version the box is beautifully designed with the griffin family pictured on center and some easter eggs to look around for the board is not the most impressive one especially compared to the simpson s and muppets monopoly versions but it is pretty nice with the griffins at center what you will love of the board is the properties which include everything from chris closet and seamus lighthouse to james woods high and geronimo s palace to the clam and channel news to mayor west s mansion and finally petoria all from both old and new seasons plus some scenes from the stewie s untold story movie the property deeds are somewhat disappointing though the do not have color watermarks like those found in the simpson s version but i guess they will do peter s fishing boat hinden peter peter copter and the pope mobile replace the railroads i bet you will not be laughing too much when you have to pay income tax for volcano insurance or for workplace sensitivity training luxury tax but hey you can t stay mad for long at the salesman guy right it would have been cool to have joe swanson on the go to jail space and have a picture of quahog prison on the jail space but well what can you do the pewter tokens are nice you can chose from tv junkie peter mug in hand brian nose picking chris lois stewie in a high chair and meg who looks like a peanut character you can also order four more tokens that include the giant chicken quagmire joe and the evil monkey the coolest changes are the chance and community chest cards that are replaced by the what the deuce and giggity giggity giggity cards respectively they are beautifully done in full color and you will find things like made sheriff of bumblescum advance to go get liposuction and implants pay confederate civil war veterans are after you go back spaces take big fat paulie to the movies as a favor collect help death get a girlfriend collect and many more the money goes as follows meg chris lois brian stewie peter the griffins there are no special rules for this version which is weird since it has been the norm for some time in these special monopoly versions to wrap it up i must say that even though they could have done a better job this is a beautiful and wonderfully done monopoly game family guy fans will love it making this a great gift have fun
1,i love the taste of this hemp protein powder i love to mush up bananas with a fork add some dried figs with raisins and pour this hemp protein all over it with the nutiva hemp seeds it tastes great and satisfies me on every level i also sensed there was much more fiber in the powder compared to other brands i couldn t believe when i saw that there was grams per serving considering that of americans are lacking in fiber this protein powder can be a great service to millions

1,this is a great magazine for those of us who grew up in the s and even on up into the s
0,this scale does not weigh correctly your results depend upon exactly where you are standing on the scale when you are weighing in i counted different results within minutes the last time i used it this is one of the least accurate scales i ve ever used spend the extra money to get a higher quality non digital scale
0,after years of building pc and installing software beta testing software i am unable even with adobe s technical support staff to install acrobat version software gets to the end of the install process and stalls no combination of repair uninstall reinstall registry cleaning advice from three technical support staff after hours on the telephone can solve the problem using xp with all the latest upgrades defragging the drives with mb ram and a adobe tech support clean registry still fails to properly install the software
1,this is hands down the best star wars game i have played or seen just the fact that you can use almost every hero and villian in the star wars movies makes this a blast to play the addition of the space combat is what really tips the scales on this title when you re flying through waves of tie fighters and you land on an imperial star destroyer and begin fighting through control rooms you begin to realize this game is really special
0,our hero amoral in his love life refusing to kick his unfaithful ex wife to the curb and making mystery solving boring why continue parker can write like no one else but his recent plots suggest the well may be dry
1,an awesome product that sells out and that s the only problem i had to call around the us to find it in a department store in stock and that would ship amazon s supplier was sold out
0,js concert was the most boring thing i have ever seen on dvd my cat was more interested in watching it then i was and that was only because of jessica s frilly costumes the sound system stank i was expecting her voice to echo like crazy all of jessica s songs were about expressing her love for nick this dvd is so boring i m falling asleep just trying to figure out what to say about it oh yeah her vocals were too breathy that pink thing she wore looked like a flamingo caught in a shredder and she should have left take my breath away alone nick didn t take her breath away she took his when she decided to walk out of their marriage nick will be siniging i m taking half away and jessica will be singing i should have prenup
0,while i like some of these songs i cannot understand a single word he sings i even heard him interviewed and i didn t understand a word when he sings he spends all the time looking down so you can t even lip read i don t think he has stage presence and i think it will be hard to grow a fan base with a singer who can t form words he doesn t sing clearly and i just can t get into his music completely i think i ll stick to r b
0,i have found another product that i want to recommend it s called alert and is sold by consultants like avon but you can also go the starlight website and order it it s a nutritional supplement and for me does provide energy without the jitters and as a bonus i don t feel hungry when i m using it they also have a product specifically for weight loss i have tried that as well i did feel a bit jittery at first but it settled after a week or so of taking it i would recommend it also i used it a few years ago and lost lbs i did consistent diet and exercise which obviously is what did the weight loss but i credit the supplement with giving me the energy to get moving and helping me curb cravings i m now looking for energy and help maintaining that weightless so for me the alert does both of what i need energy and hunger control and it s less expensive than the weight loss supplement so i now use it i ve used this for years and have not had any problems
0,i admit i haven t finished this book a friend recommended it to me as i have been having problems with insomnia i was interested in reading a book about women s health issues and this one sounded intriguing until she started in with her tarot cards interest in astrology and angels granted i am not a firm believer in just the hard facts but its really hard to believe anything this woman writes after it is clear that common sense isn t alternative enough for her
1,i was hoping that they were a little larger in size and not as thick however i think it s a decent buy for only i bought this as a stocking stuffer for my girlfriend it comes packaged in a beautiful velvet blue box thats almost big enough to fit a watch very clean presentation when you open it up the white gold really shines the free shipping was fast and i do mean quick i ordered this late at night and it arived the very next day i ve never had a quicker shipment for free before if your looking for a great deal on white gold earings i think you ve found it
0,the other boleyn girl and the queen s fool are two of the best books i ve ever read and i ve read a lot of books especially about this period which especially fascinates me they were gripping to the end and my involvement with the characters was complete true masterpieces so whenever a new book by philippa gregory comes out i buy it hoping to have the same experience and lately have been sorely disappointed the virgin s lover fell flat and now i am trying to read this book but not finding myself engaged must give it up one reviewer suggested the books were being written too quickly that is always an easy guess however it depends on the writer anthony trollope for instance was able to turn out amazing book after amazing book with incredible speed that may or may not be the case with gregory i know as a writer myself that there are times when the work flows out feeling almost as if it s channeled from another source and times when it s harder more mechanical the more challenging situations are those when i m not entirely convinced or in love with my subject so to me neither of these books feels as if they spring from a natural impulse they feel forced constructed i m going back to trollope
1,case is pretty much what you see i have no complaints the case protects my camera very well
0,i couldn t agree more about this product it s appalling how badly made it is the concept is very cute a toolbox that unfolds into bridges and roads for the small die cast vehicles my year old has a hard enough time dealing with frustration without this toy adding to it the bridge on the right doesn t properly attach or stay up and the road pieces do not attach properly it s also a battle to get the tool box to connect together my son always wants to play with it but i can t cope with his cries of frustration when it all falls apart i think this toy will have to mysteriously disappear one night while he is sleeping they should withdraw this rubbish from the market and refund us all our money
1,i really like how this step was designed to stay in place we have a cheaper plastic stool in another bathroom that tends to scoot too easily as our son climbs up on it this one stays put the only reason this stool didn t get stars from me is because of the textured top it is a little difficult to clean since this is a potty step stool it has gotten some messes on it that i wish would have been easier to get rid of
1,it has a clean soap smell i also recommend the volume shampoo conditioner it made my hair feel very soft

0,the eyeshadow isn t bad nice color but the packaging was a disappointment the brush sits down the center of the encased loose powder and you can t get very much onto the brush there is no way to open the casing either so its pretty useless i found the powder to be an odd texture for a loose eyeshadow also
1,if you need something to get you going in the morning shock therapy will do it we re talking major minty shower gel here your skin will be tingling the smell clears the mind and gets the blood flowing to the brain a gift note this would be a good gift for someone who doesn t like flowery bath products even guys would like this

1,i bought both the flavor gift box and the bean blast basket for corporate christmas gifts the basket was much more expensive and didn t have nearly the wow value of this flavor gift box it s shaped like a monopoly game box and has the substantial feel of a real gift it s also reasonably priced at around of course the jelly beans are top notch and the unique flavors speak for themselves this is an excellent gift item or treat for yourself
0,i don t care what other reviewers say but this bed rail sucked i used it on my sons toddler bed since it seemed to be the only product that would accomodate that type of bed it took up so much mattress space that my son barely had room to sleep in his bed and it would constantly come unlocked and if i buy another bed rail for our next child it won t be a mesh one cause they get too dirty i can t remember if this cover was removable or not if it was i m sure it would have been a pain in the a to remove
1,the watch performs as advertised atomic clock i live miles from ft collins and the watch automatically syncs every night even if i don t put it near a window solar recharge the watch arrived with a low battery it charged up to full after sitting in the sun for an afternoon since then it has been on full charge with no special actions on my part the watch is big and heavy i take it off when typing because it slides down to the end of my wrist and knocks against my hand the watch s user interface is unintuitive this is the first watch i ve owned where i had to read and re read the manual to set an alarm or the hourly charm i find the timex interface and the old style casio interface much easier to use in the interests of saving battery power the alarms are short and quiet i can t count on this watch s alarms to wake me up it d be nice if the watch had a power hog mode with loud insistent alarms and long illuminations all in all i like the watch it is nice to have a digital watch that sets its own time and doesn t run out of batteries i wish the user interface was more intuitive the alarms were more effective and the watch was smaller
1,works great and with any mattress due to severe neck injuries i can now sleep better at a slight incline thanks

1,barry levinson s diner is a rich panoramic snapshot of a time people and place that s treasured by those of us who lived through that period and had paralell experiences he s a master of his craft and so are all that contributed to this work
0,this is not a good product unless you re willing to screw one of the parts into your door which we were not since it was a newly installed hi quality door and the way the door was designed was not conducive to doing so as a result the double backed tape which was required for the use of this product quickly came off you can t really expect a piece of plastic which is held to a wooden door with just two sided tape to withstead the pressures of a person large or small trying to open the door it just isn t going to hold up it s a nice try but in the end was a waste of my money
1,this is great for keeping the sun out of my baby s eyes from all angles and those on window shades always fall off and are annoying when you want to roll the window down this does the job just fine highly recommend it

1,i ve never smelled anything like this if you ve ever been to the mediterranean coast you will be instantly transported by this scent it goes on strong lasts long and dries down to a wonderfully woodsy citrusy finish that definitely has a bit of ocean air but not the yankee candle ocean water type scent this is the real thing like an aromatherapy treatment you can take with you rejoice all women who are tired of sugary syrupy womens perfume this is it
0,i bought this player because it was just a few bucks cheaper than the ipod and i ended up paying dearly for it it is a piece of junk that stopped working only after a couple months the firmware decided to stop recognizing songs albums titles and eventually that there was even any music to listen to now i have a dollar player with no music on it that will not interface with my pc customer service don t count on it so if your into extensively troubleshooting highly frustrating pieces of junk this is a great product
1,we bought this clock to replace one of those cheap quartz wall clocks in our new used motorhome i wanted it so that i would not have to wear a watch but would still have a dependable and accurate time piece it took a couple of nights before the lacrosse atomic clock received the signal to synch up but after that it seems to be working exactly as advertised accurate right to the second this clock has a large protrudance on the back where the clock s works reside so the bezel does not sit flush to the wall either a large hole needs to be cut in the wall or you just have to live with it no big deal but it is something difficult to see from photos on the internet this is why i gave it out of stars
0,i bought this toy for my shark crazed year old she was so stoked and we prepped the tank added the recommended water chemicals and dropped in two small goldfish less than hours later they were dead repeat hours later same story we tried a single betta frank but less than days later he s dead we don t know what it is the water was tested it s fine we think it is the overall design of the tank could the tight fitting lid be responsible possibly ammonia by product buildup from the fish who knows but we have given up and are dumping this promising toy into the trash bin

1,calling this a peel doesnt seem quite right when i think of the word peel i imagine the old gel type peels that you would let dry on your face and then take off like a mask or i think of something that is harsh or abrasive while this works like a peel it is gentle and goes far beyond what you would expect a facial product to do you need this product if you your skin is prone to break out and is very congested your skin is sun damaged your skin is aging rapidly you enjoy in office medical peels you have a big event coming up and want your skin to look great you want to maximize penetration of your treatment products you want baby soft skin also if you smoke i first tried this years ago when i was a smoker and it made such a difference in the texture and clarity of my skin this is a truly amazing product and completely different and unique to anything else on the market try it and you ll see this product also lasts a surprisingly long time you only use half a capsule for each treatment which gives you several months of usage out of it
0,the editor s gratingly smug and breezy monthly letter sets the pace for this vapid lifestyle magazine which you ll enjoy only if you re like her rich creepily entitled self absorbed and interested merely in the accoutrements of opulent dining but not really food or actual cooking itself

0,i bought this slick looker for the desk in my office i had a beat up yo digital clock radio that had poor sound however its tuner worked ok and i figured with the tivoli rep i d get some good listening along with the good looks my office is inside the facility without windows so reception can be tricky the tuner for the pa speakers in the rest of the office has to have the antenna just right i was very frustrated to find that the radio simply couldnt hold a signal a station would tune in nice but the fade in and out to barely hearable i bought an amplified antenna but didnt help then i tried it in a windowed room and same problem i was very disapointed
0,the product broke the first day i used it i m going to have to be more careful i think they are all cheep
0,i am surprised there are not more reviews on how ridiculous the prices are i really did enjoy the ease of tivo from pre hd days and wanted to go back from my comcast hd dvr i then saw the pricetag and unlike the other people i can not justify spending that much money for a dvr it is definitely not worth it for something i get for extra a month attached to my cable service yes i do love the tivo interface and searching but i will not pay that much for it it feels like business suicide for tivo to want to sell that product at a ridiculous price knock dollars off that retail price and i might change my mind

1,it s an ok knife that picture of it can trick you if you look at the middle of the page it says we ship black if we are out of silver don t get me wrong black knives are cool but the handle for it is like some kind of green the odds of actualy getting the silver knife is like winning the lottery so i hope you like black weapons the tip of it is silver if you look at it closeley just try not to poke an eye out when will you need a led light on a sword unless your fighting ninjas in the dark do you know why this weapon is so cheap i think that it s shipped from over seas so it may take a while to arive just don t challenge your nextdoor neibor to a duel to the death the day after you buy this and you should be fine p s if you re looking at my account name i am not neil meislin but i am related to him
0,easy boring bugs bugs bugs glitches glitches glitches question is this a new game or possible bonus maps from that they decided to make into a new game to profit more money hmmmm the positive you can cook your grenades now i like mine medium rare possibly useful in online matches as apposed to where you couldn t and it was point less to throw a grenade in online matches because you knew where it was and could just move but i will never know because i thankfully rented the damn thing and didn t buy it wait i didn t my dad did on a free rental from blockbuster so they didn t get any of my hardly earned money good for me also could anyone tell me why i kept getting stuck on walls tanks people just about everything i think i was stuck in the air if you like this game you need to get the f k out and buy something else to play that i have so i can meet up with you and beat you also if you don t like my run on sentences you can yep you guess it get the f k out

1,you probably don t want to fix them for your guests but they are an excellent way to keep eggs on hand for baking or as part of your emergency food supply
0,at first the case seemed like a good idea but after the third use the zipper stopped working because the case does not stay open on its own there is a tendency to push the case open and force the zipper backward and apart after fixing it a couple of times it is now permanently broken bad design perhaps velcro would have been better here
1,this is a veary fun baseball game i first played it at my summer camp and it was so fun i got it for myself
1,ace rolls out its second volume of early girl and girl led group sounds this time there are six tunes that did not make it into the top and that may seem to be a bit of a letdown in content but when looking at the overall repertoire this series still beats just about anything else of the genre out there with enough ten top songs to keep the music familiar there are lots of seldom found sides making the listening much more interesting and not sounding like every other oldies comp between such monster hits as lesley gore s pre womens rights anthem you don t own me the exciters go and get him tell him and kathy young s barely pubescent a thousand stars are cradled such rarities as the secrets the boy next door a madara white of you don t own me and other gore tunes fame composition april stevens teach me tiger later with brother nino tempo striking it big with deep purple and timi yuro s of hurt fame what s a matter baby in this volume three of the tracks are acknowledged as having been lifted from disc but only track is of substandard sound quality even so many of the tracks appear in stereo the remainder in mono the page booklet accompaning the disc provides pages of fascinating backround to the artists represented ace again hits the mark with this new compilation
1,while this movie was filmed in the coos bay oregon area i got to be an extra in it i had my doubts about it at the time but now that i have seen it i say it is well worth watching if you like humor and a feel good movie some profanity and mild nudity not for the real youngins btw i am the guy in the blue baseball cap at the bar the girl i was flirting with is my sister
0,i would recommend just buying one that sits on top of the toilet and a stepping stool you don t have to clean out of the cup and you ll probably already have a stepping stool so that your child can reach the sink it really saves a lot of hastle my mother in law and i both bought this potty for my daughter one for her house and one for mine it was hard for me to put together my mo in law couldn t get it together at all it makes a loud trumpet sound every time water passes a sensor inside the toilet that scared my daughter terribly at first but luckily it took a lot of batteries to work and it died the other thing i d like to point out is if your child actually likes the noise and the batteries die they are almost impossible to replace in order to replace them you have to take almost the whole toilet apart which again is very hard to put back together we got ours on sale so i don t mind the expenditure when you are buying these things just remember it is only a toilet that they will be using for a year or so tops
0,most people seem to like the soundtrack from glory but this fact does not necessarily make glory a great or even good soundtrack most people also like the food served atmacdonald s but no intelligent person would argue in favor of thier menu as being good or great based on numbers it is something to put in one s mouth whenever nothing better is available and one is hungry the same might be said regarding glory if one s tastes run to choir music almost any gregorian chant album is head and shoulders above the insipid choir music to be found here as for the themes they are commonplace variations often bootlegged from other scores by the same composer or new work that the composer later bootlegged into other scores so all in all the effort plays rather like a buffet offering at a cheap homestyle diner the film on the other hand was well done and apparently from reading many of the other reviews here the unwarranted praise owes more to satisfaction with the film itself rather than very much stand alone praise for the score horner has written a lot of really really beautiful and original scores but perhaps because most of his best efforts have been for small or little noticed movies these have not been recognised for thier greatness so in sum we are left with a very popular film provided with a very mundane score by an award winning composer
1,i ve been using sweetleaf steviaplus for about weeks now and i m so glad i decided to try it i was worried about the research coming out about aspartame and splenda well it just does terrible things to my stomach i simply can t use it so i started doing some web searching and learned about stevia i liked the fact that it was natural and used extensively in other countries such as japan but i still kept my expectations low it sounded too good to be true and i figured it would taste awful i ordered sweetleaf steviaplus and to my surprise and delight i love the taste it s sweet and no bitterness now i m a person who is used to using artificial sweeteners so someone who uses only sugar might have a different opinion but i did share it with a coworker to use in his tea and he really liked it as well so don t be afraid to try it if you haven t already i notice that i m feeling a lot better lately maybe it s the switch from artificial sweeteners to stevia at any rate i m happy with it and i recently placed another order for both packets and tablets

1,this magazine is well sweet i love it i picked up a subscription in january and i think it s great they get previews on a ton of games even those that aren t that gossiped about they bring a vieraty in opinions when it comes to there reviews they get a scoped up article on new games very fast they re not centered on only the good games but they also include a shame of the month lowest scoring game of the month award they include three scores from a scale of and the reviewers simply put out the truth and down right say that a game sucks they have full coverage on new platforms and games they also include posters and stragety guides with some of their issuses this magazine is alot better than the dragonball z obssessed gamepro its fast and relibel definetly a great buy

0,from amazon ca the action replay max is more than just a video game enhancer vge or at least it claims to be my version is quite old yet but it claims to include a region free dvd player and a memory card compression utility squeeze more saves onto your memory card i have not used either of these features personally but i have heard horror stories about the memory manager corrupting gamesaves and whole memory cards some reusable some permanently damaged this and the fact that you must load up the action replay software to access saves that use the memory manager turned me off of using it however the real reason i bought the armax was for its codes and i ll get to those in a second the armax like the newer gamesharks loads its software from a cd this is a major annoyance for me every time you load a game you must insert the armax memory card which does i don t know what and cd go sit on the couch and wait for the software to load choose your codes then get up and put the actual game dvd in and wait for it to load you can t simply turn on your and go sit down in the old days of cartridge gaming you would snap the vge between the game and the console so you could turn on the console and go sit down the early generation gamesharks had a little box that would attach to an expansion slot on the or and that was it if you wanted it to load before the game you turned on its switch even if the armax was perfect in every other way and it s not btw it would get a maximum of stars as long as you had to boot it from a cd first i mean why can t the memory card part of it at least hold the codes for even just the current game you re playing after the system is shut off or reset so you don t have to load the software every d mn time ok rant over on to the codes the user interface for the armax is better than the gameshark functionally they are very similar of course but the armax just feels cleaner and easier to use it offers a beginner interface that includes descriptions of code functions not for user entered ones though if i remember right and a more robust expert mode on big advantage in theory that the armax has over the gameshark is its ability to update itself using your s broadband connection the upshot is you can download new codes for your favorite games fairly quickly instead of manually typing them all in using the controller the dark cloud to go with this silver lining is that you have no control over which codes you download its all or nothing and since these updates are stored on your memory card not the armax one it will quickly fill up with codes and gamesaves for games of which you will never play no wonder the armax has the option to come with or of space on its memory card it s to store all the useless codes any entered codes you choose to apply will either work do nothing or lock up the game i have come across all though to armax s credit mostly the former the absurd choice forcing you to download and save updates for every game in the library when you may want just one loses the armax another star a note about manually entering codes the sub headings and folders for a game have their own codes that must be entered if you want them to show up in the game s code list finally as mentioned in the reviews by bret morris and glenn nichols amazon ca the armax initially did not work with the new revision of the fat a couple years ago at all this happened for me as well i returned three and two armaxes before i realized it was a defect in all current versions at the time of armax i had to send away and get a new disc direct from intec which now works as well as expected since the armax has been on shelves for several years since i bought mine i assume any bought today would not have this problem however at the time there was no way to find out about this problem without contacting intec personally retailers were not aware of the problem and no notices were posted on the codejunkies web site this inadequate treatment of a widespread problem drops armax down to two stars in my opinion if you re in the market for a vge both armax and gameshark have their pros and cons i would assume both have released newer versions with newer features than the ones i have looks at the specs assume nothing and don t be afraid to e mail the companies requesting details regarding any features you have questions about i apologize for the length of this review but i find there are very few in depth reviews of vges on the web or in print maybe reviewers feel they are above using vges i don t know
1,this is a great quality product best quality transfer paper i ve ever used it s pretty expensive if you buy it here though you can get this same exact product at your local office depot for a cheaper price plus you don t have to pay shipping handling
1,finding sleepwear that has enough support for lactating large breasted women is no fun but this dress is pretty good what this will not give you is any kind of coverage if you re ok with people seeing you with major cleavage then this is fine if not just wear it to bed not in the hospital or as i see some women do out of the house yikes i think i d be arrested
1,i really liked the outside design of the book a lot of books were cartoonish and really was drawn to the look of the book i wish the book did not have so much random fill in pages i had hoped that it would have blanks to fill in for different events ages of the child but all in all i am pleased with it i would most likely buy again
1,i researched many breast pumps on line before my daughter was born after she was two weeks old and my milk supply was established i decided to purchase a pump i had read many reviews about isis and was so skeptical and i didn t want to pay for an automatic one i enjoy breastfeeding so much however i am not comfortable nursing in public not to mention pumping allows my husband to feed her too after much thought i decided to purchase the isis quot back to work quot it came with the pump bottles and the tote which by the way is very discreet i had no trouble assembling it at all from the first time i used isis i ve had great success i am able to pump several ounces in minutes without any pain or discomfort as i control the suction our daughter does not have any problems switching from bottle to breast at all nor have we ever experienced bottles nipples leaking i assemble the pump and the nipples rings when they are just out of the sterilizer and are still wet i love how easy this is to use and i don t have to find a place to plug it in at work the only thing i ve noticed is that the little gel packs don t stay cool enough for my liking so i went and purchased little ice packs cents and they work like a charm i would recommend this to any mom
0,i really can t understand why all the reviewers are going crazy over this record first off i bought it without hearing anything by them before but it had been highly recomended to people who like tool and mars volta by amazon they couln t have been any more wrong so why did i personally find this so painfull well the whole thing in general is quite painfull first off the musicians the whole band sound like studio musicians no obvious indivuality or anything new to offer then we get to the vocals the closest thing i can compare them to are alison moyet or anthony and the johnsons i don t mind anthony and the johnsons but this guys vocals and the music just don t rock which is fine it s ok not to rock but why the hell being a tool fan and mars volta fan was i recomended this it s bland it s week and the dubby bass boring guitar playing sound weak vocals actually forget it the whole package it is just lame

1,i loved this game so much i have gone and got a second copy mine has stopped working i love the feeling that an entire world lives within the game and you can always just steal a car and ride listen to the radio and take in vice city s many sites tommy vercetti excellantly cast as ray liotta of goodfellas fame gets out of the slammer and goes back to his turf he gets sent to vice city to get him out of the way because really they don t want him around anymore and they certainly don t want to answer his questions about why he got jailed you can ride bikes take cars helicopter fly over the city go through districts with different cultures and work for many gangs bikers columbians cops even accompanied by a sound track that beats the heck out of any other game i ve played a radio with enough variation to keep everyone happy as they do their drive bys and cruise looking at women and the talk shows classy touch the game play is smooth and with barely a bug to be seen flows from day to night and back again with the city in sync vice city at night is amazing you also get weather variations and the impact of that in the rain bikes tend to skid more and you fall off it s that kind of attention to detail that means the game never grows tiresome the hidden jumps to be done with all manner of vehicles and the taxi paramedic etc missions mean the game really is so open ended it s been three years and i m still exploring vice city classic
1,i have used this product for over a year now the reason i bought it was for the back up software email was a secondary consideration let me talk about the back up for a moment it is quick to download and about that easy to start using the set up can be done in two ways either by default or manual i chose the default version which covers my home folders and it automatically backs up everything to my external hard drive at a time of my choosing it will also set up a seperate version of a back up of vital stuff to an online storage for you that you get when you buy mac as well restoring a lost file couldn t be easier just click on restore and the locate the file or files you want to restore the program is set up so that everything is named exactly as you originally named it on your hard drive you don t have to look for your file name in a long string of code just select it and click restore it will either put it in the exact place of your old file or in new location of your choosing i haven t really messed with the other features yet but the email is spam free and has been my default email for over a year now with out any problems hope you buy the service and will enjoy it as much as i have

0,i bought this as a birthday gift for my husband and while i wasn t expecting the best quality in the world because of the price i was still a little disappointed the company did a wonderful job of packaging shipping the product even the buttons were individually protected i paid for expedited shipping but they still cut the deadline close so i was nervous about it arriving in time the lining on the inside is thick and bulky so it isn t as streamlined as the pic implies and tends to make the leather bulge a bit in places it was lumpy looking even in the box removing the zip out lining doesn t change this there s significant padding in the shoulders it s also a shinier leather than expected sizing chart seems a bit inaccurate i ordered a size larger than he normally wears in coats which is a size larger than his regular clothing but it was still too snug in places lining or not overall though i d say i got what i paid for if you don t count the unusually high shipping charges even standard shipping and handling charges were unusually high compared to other companies

1,white rabbit is addicting they re like a milk taffy slighty sweet but with a lot of flavor totally awesome
1,la haine is basically a day in the lives of three guys from ghettos on the outskirts of paris after an apparently race motivated police beating murder the ghettos are rife with looters rioters and many bigoted and intrusive police or pigs as the characters fondly refer to them suspicious of anyone not caucasian or under in its most reductive form it s about a flawed society whose seams are bursting under the pressures of ignorance intolerance and various isms in the movie itself this tends to remain below the surface of the characters existences but for in a few moments namely encounters with police and skinheads and brought to the forefront with a bathroom scat anecdote and repeated reference to a very bitter joke involving society man and rabbit jumping off a building the movie is frequently funny although it takes place in france where these issues are perhaps less closeted what with le pen getting percent of the vote any close examination of pretty much every modern world nation will reveal just how ingrained these problems are in the present state of the world
0,i did not notice in the product description that this product interfaces to the serial port on a computer since most new computers use usb for serial interface the usefulness of this unit is limited my two newly purchased hp computers do not have an interface that is compatible with this product i would not have bought it had i known this i have not used the gps since i bought it it will probably be tossed out the serial cable is hidden behind cardboard in the clamshell package so you don t see it prior to opening the package once the package is opened it is a mess that probably cannot be returned lastly this is one of the worst packaging jobs i have seen the plastic clamshell is so hard to open that i think the customer is in danger being cut by the opening knife or scissors the cut plastic is also dangerous

0,i agree with the previous reviews that say hydrocoach is not accurate instructions say to take deliberate sucks even with that not all ounces register it might only register ounces after filling the ounce bottle i like gadgets but this water bottle is not worth it it would have been better if you fill up the bottle and press a button when you drink all the water in it adding ouonces each time

0,amazon and this company are nightmares i ordered this scale a month ago and the expected ship date keeps changing i finally called amazon and dealt with the most ignorant customer service person ever he was no help at all after waiting on hold for about minutes he told me to call back because he was having a systems upgrade all he was able to give me was the ship date range which has already changed several times amazon needs to drop this from their website if they cannot do a better job with getting it out on time
0,i really wanted this to work i have serious dark circles under my eyes and have tried everything else but i ve been using this twice a day for two months and i haven t noticed any improvement at all not even a little in fact my eyes might actually look worse it has not faded the dark circles nor has it improved the bags
1,i bought these for my zune after an exhaustive search for a good sounding compact headphone for work and working out at the gym if you are like me and can t stand all the earbuds out there then you need to find another solution i tried the premium zune buds at bucks and the bose quiet comfort buds at bucks but they just gave me earaches and i was always fiddling with them to keep them in my ear canal tight i read countless reviews of this headphone and i can say this is the best sounding under headphone out there that won t mess with your hair yes better than even the bose earbuds if you are only using the stock buds or phones with your player be prepared to be blown away tight full bass range with smooth airy highs and mellow mids you don t have to crank them either they sound rich even at lower volumes but if you do crank them they don t distort at all if you have ever tried the bose quiet comforts at the stores these sound very similar but with an open air design the only negative is the comfort the little rubbery clips that go behind your ears take some getting used to and can hurt after minutes or so i think i ll get used to it i d much rather deal with a little discomfort on the outer ear vs jamming an earbud in my ear and getting a sore ear canal which i had that could lead to ear infections or other more serious ear problems some other reviewers complained about the headband but it sounds like they were not wearing these right once on your noggin the band needs rotated up toward you skull in the back till it touches your head this keeps everything nice and tight and also gives the earclips more space and flexibilty which equals greater comfort i do not think the headband is too tight it has the perfect amount of tension to keep these in place i might buy a pair of the px s as well just for wearing around the house or lying in bed reading the px is the same exact phone in an over the head design at i can afford to get both

0,most of the other reviews for this toy are correct when it works my kids love it and it is pretty cool when it works but it doesn t work very well very often you need to find just the right car and everything needs to line up exactly and even then the car crashes a lot we have found one car out of about that works somewhat well but even with this car the success rate is about in so read the reviews and make your own judgements personally i m glad this was a gift and i did not spend any money on it my kids will still play with and enjoy it but not as much as they would if it worked better

1,i love this thing it was easy to assemble everything just screws on and it even comes with a little needle pump mine doesnt stay very well after you stop punching it or break the rythm if you stick to the same rythm it doesnt pop off the suction cup holds very well but the back and forth motion causes one side to creep up slightly and it therefore loses its suction i d by it again in a second despite this would probably hold together if i put some tape around it like someone else suggested but its not really a big problem for me people come to my desk and love it greatest office accessory evar
0,diana krall s popularity is not hard to understand she s easy on the eyes and possesses a fine voice rich round and polished but that s where the good news ends the selection of material and the narcoleptic bossa nova on the rocks arrangements combine to create a cd that is nothing less than a love song to darvon in fact inside industry sources maintain that the entire cd was recorded in the frozen food section of a supermarket late at night in order to eliminate the middle man the rule with standards is don t do them unless you can bring something fresh to the fair ms krall beats these exhausted warhorses mercilessly cruel and unusual punishment considering it s a wonder they re still standing the resuscitation of popsicle toes is both the final insult and injury for blissful years this sliver of saccharine twaddle resided in richly deserved obscurity how could she do this to us wherever there are hotel lobbies occupied by mildly inebriated people who aren t listening to each other much less the ambient audio wallpaper there will be a demand for music of this type the diana kralls of the world can always find work because for many smooth equals good walk don t krall beyond this woozy soft focused world there is music that is real and really matters

1,you owe it to yourself to own a flashlight made using the cree xr e led it s roughly twice as bright as the currently comparable luxeon led also the regulator circuitry keeps the light at a fairly constant level through the life of the battery not all led flashlights have this feature it s small enough to be put on a keychain yet puts out a powerful beam
1,my dvd had english subtitles the first act is the best watching the young japanese couple interact is very rewarding there is so much subtlety and silent communicating no surprise since it is revealed in the booklet that jim jarmusch director created this movie around the japanese actress youki kudoh life is beautiful star and wife of roberto benigni nicoletta braschi stars in the second act more great quiet acting she is a true beauty funny role by the late screamin jay hawkins also appearing in the late joe strummer of the clash

1,i have studied kenpo karate and several other disciplines of martial science and i can say honestly that this movie is accurate my father who is a former kenpo instructor and i both recognize things from the movie kenpo is an ancient martial art from about years ago that was formed by combining the major martial arts of the time such as kung fu tae kwon do and ju jitsu last century though an outstanding martial artist named ed parker became an expert in kenpo and americanized it jeff speakman was as i have been corrected a degree black belt in american kenpo he does an excellent job of keeping what is in the movie real i especially like how a history and the philosophy of kenpo is given during the scene in which he is shown learning kenpo but don t take my word for it go see the movie i know that a lot of people have gotten rid of the vhs players but if you have one get this movie the plot is decent and the fighting is incredible
0,less a view from afar or broad exposure of solitude from the human condition this book more aptly excerpts the author s personal conflicts with human relationships a one on one wrestling match with the self with no spectators and no judges the book is a good read for academic analysis but not so fun for venturist philosophy
1,the medela breast pump works with dr brown s bottles you can pump directly into the bottle just an added benefit to an already great product i ve been using mine almost daily for months and have had no problems it s worth the money if you plan on breastfeeding pumping for more than a couple of months
1,kraft macaroni and cheese beckons back to lonely days running home at lunchtime as i lay heart strewn and crying about the harsh rejection meted upon me by the fairest of the playground beauties soft noodles in a cheese cream sauce would ease my ache daily at morning recess i would smile weakly and say hello to heidi who in return would grimace there stood i in a pile of sadness swings and slides all around alone and she having moved on would toil no longer in my presence today all so many years beyond i do not remember if it was her kickball skills or the way she whispered green eggs and ham ever so flirtatiously just within earshot her gentle words were never meant for me no matter how i thought her eyes caught mine and with clarity at recess i was reminded of her tease recess would pass into lunchtime and as the bell rang i blew out the door and ran the quarter mile home anger grief all inside boiling looking to be purged pushed me homeward second grade happiness would be found where my mom made lunch resting on our kitchen table steaming with freshly ground pepper was the golden orange macaroni and cheese a bit of butter and a few drops of milk converged with the cheese for the smooth sweet salty taste with which i could indulge my insatiated heart my mother forever smiling and me upset at heidi who was forever guiling until soon i with my belly full was no longer riling fair maiden was never won by macaroni and cheese but my broken heart was oft mended by its flavor
0,i only had product for days and it stopped working correctly i opened up the unit to discover a circuit board had been hod poged on to the main board and it soldered connections had broken i would not advise the purchase of this item it is poory put to gether on the insid
1,i purchased these earrings for my infant daughter since most earrings are too large in my opinion for a month old s ears this was the perfect solution as my daughter likes to lie on me when taking a short nap the first earrings she had poked into me and it was uncomfortable for me these are small enough not to bother me the prongs do cover a bit more of the diamond than is shown in the pictures but they are still very cute i also like the backs as they screw on to the posts and are nice and safe for baby s head
0,originally i purchased this heavy duty case to protect my new expensive however wearing the case on my belt with the belt clip my phone fell out of the case several times when the case cover accidentally opened up luckily the phone was not functionally damaged but i have several big dents and scratches on the case i m going to stop using a case now since the phone is now already beat up the latch mechanism for the cover will loosen up with use especially since you ll have to open and close it repeatedly to access the touch screen also it took a bit getting used to to have to open the case to make a phone call the overall quality of this case is very good tho because it fits the phone very snuggly and the holes line up to all the buttons i guess its a great case if you don t wear it on your belt but i can t justify such a huge case if i carry it in my pocket
0,this cushion is very disappointing in less than a week it has gone completely flat and the seams have separated i am not a large person either it doesn t even puff back up when i don t use it don t buy it it does not do anything it is advertised for
0,this watch is very attractive however the clasp is not stable and it has fallen off my arm several times i rarely wear it as a result and am always surprised it s still there when i do with a more stable clasp this would be a star watch but this problem is severe enough that it makes the watch worthless to me hence star
0,this cd should not have been released because it adds really nothing to this jarrett quartet s other three releases it s like taking a fat paint brush full of cheap house paint and making a greasy mess of what was a very beautiful triptych belonging my song and nude ants are all virtuoso spiritually empowered performances and should by all means be purchased and enjoyed but i d go nada on this one if i were you i was sitting with my year old mother listening to the last track and complaining about how lame it was and she said it was hum drum and she s likes lawrence welk and it was past her bedtime it s past late night willie s bedtime too i hate to tell you heck i ve heard high school jazz bands cook twice as hot as this keith and the somnambulists incarnation garbarek sounds like he s going to give himself a hernia trying to get out the altissimos i can t think of one interesting drum riff in the whole minutes plus neither can christensen les scandinavianes sound like they need about hours sleep and then maybe they start thinking about picking up musical instruments jarrett is as wired as ever but even he can t keep up with some of the tempos and the overall mood is disoriented forced and cumbersome how any reviewer can say that this release captures the quartet s tight integration displayed amazingly well elsewhere is beyond me with the exception of innocence none of the compositions are very good either oasis has an interesting if dire melody line but it can t summon the required ambience because of all of the clutter and dog poop around it unlike the other three releases mentioned above this one has very little magnetism the first track is all rambling rose jazz where none of the musicians are feeding off each other i don t enjoy this kind of jazz so cliched and unintegrated it contains that jarrettian need to rush things and gang jump the tempo with heavy handed neurosis peddled as jazz fusion you feel like some nut in a bmw is suddenly sitting inches off your bumper too demented to use the passing lane yes i know keith has mastered his scales and likes to crack knuckles with tempos and yes i now have a headache there is an interesting part at the end however where garbarek cuts way back on the throttle and swaggers around in the lower and upper registers of his tenor sax in some nice ways but the transition is contrived at best and bears no organic relation to the first part only innocence benefits from the fact that these guys are probably taking a red eye flight to new york soon it is a beautiful lullabye arguably jarrett s best composition true the nude ants version is all you need really but something happens on this version of the song that is very special jarrett puts in one of his best if not his best jazz piano performances the composition is perfectly suited to his virtuosity and sensitivities and the somnambulists who are still pulling a code can t screw it up even if they want to there is a halo around keith jarrett s head i bet you garbarek somnambulist plays the melody with a lot of heart but he screws up the tempo in a very brief weak improvisation the man is tapped knows it and decides it s time to end the song palle danielsson somnambulist misses a lot of notes doubly bad on double bass and goes off into an ill conceived top heavy improvisation right at the beginning of the song like garbarek he knows enough to stop and retreat letting jarrett take over i can t remember a dang thing about somnambulist christensen but jarrett s effort cannot be touched and he plays like a true wizard a week later at the village vangard nude ants they ll all be playing at this level if anything i d like to see the pm version of innocence included in a compilation of the best concert performances by this quartet rather than a whole release of this mediocre concert for the most part here we get hum drum mountains where many of the great riffs from the releases mentioned above are handled like a shaky old butler serving up tea with people getting burned and tablecloths getting ruined in particular garbarek s performance on nude ants is far superior to this one and maybe the mean streets of greenwich village got his norwegian up maybe they weren t so sure if they were going to make it back to the hotel alive new york used to be like this you know and well it just might be your last gig on personal mountains it s all polite thank yous and japanese clapping robotically not a tinkling glass of booze in the whole schmooze not even a bonze meditating for more but that manfred eicher such a card i tell you
1,this is great granola and at such a great price i usually make my own but for this price it s not worth the effort thanks for the great value
0,i thought buying a item with a well known name as this would be great i would have hoped the price would even out my possible satisfaction for this product also i loved the pink when i opened the box the plates on the flat iron were hanging off i tried to snap them into place but they would not stay for the amount of money i payed i expected a much better product needless to say i returned it the next day
0,the book starts off ok with a good introduction of the various api s and is ok reading up untill chapter programming linux audio this is where the book fails terribly none of the audio samples will compile and the information about openal is just plain wrong first the function used to open a wav file is no the corerct function to use for linux the author uses the version this is just the start of the openal errors minus one star second the book s two websites one of which no longer exists loki contains no errata and no way to contact the author the only information is avalible is a zip file of the books sample files which do not compile of course minus two stars ohter things about the book that did not work for me was the fact that the author uses c instead of c while c is still used for game development most programmers are attempting to migrate to c and ood books released about should reflect that second the author uses tcl as a game scripting engine while i can agree to a point based on the fact of the easy of implementation the author should have used a common scripting engine such as lua although the author does mention at the end of the book that tcl was proably a bad idea third the author should have introduced autoconf very early in the book instead of waiting untill chapter the main thing that i liked about the book was the good intro to programming with linux in general the topics of linux debugging and makefiles i thought was good assuming you have experince in these areas on other platfoms also the coverage of sdl was a pretty good intro
0,this feeder was great the first year but the screw in connection cracked and leaked after one season
1,we love popcorn as an occasional treat at night but don t like the salt and fat that usually comes with most microwave popcorn we had been using a microwave popper to make our own plain popcorn but with no oil whatsoever it lacked a little something this is just right low in fat no salt so we can add seasonings if we choose and organic to boot i also feel good about buying newman s products because of the causes they support and all the money doesn t go to corporate profits
0,was not impressed narrow scoped personal reflections applications limited i also read the male companion book wild at heart and was also not impressed
0,this toy is very cute however my month baby has difficulty kicking the feet pads to make the fish move it ends up moving all around and i can not see in the mirror the plus is that it is something for her to look at instead of just the seat
0,the animation excellent the characters excellent the premise excellent laugh lines plenty of them and well executed this is a movie you will say was worth spending your money on the problem is as adults you will understand the movie is about putting the past to rest so you are free to enjoy your now and your future for kids they don t see a lesson in putting your past to rest they see if you don t like something put it to rest as is r i p dead after the crotchety old man doesn t every haunted house need one to heighten the tension identifies the haunting is related to someone he knows there is far too personal a vendetta to finish them off again also shame on the producers of this movie a kids movie there is far too much irresponsible adult behaviour babysitter getting it on with boyfriend boyfriend getting drunk and threatening the kids etc it is just not necessary to tell this story i wouldn t let any relative of mine under see this otherwise excellent flick
0,this book is unfortunately not up to par for kay hooper her normal suspense is missing and you would have to be psychic to know who the murderer is there isn t a single clue at any point in time the heroine keeps loosing her memory so you don t even have the usual good characterizations of hero heroine since she can t even remember much about herself much less him if you like kay go ahead and read it but i hope the next one is back up to her usual high standard
1,i absolutely love this scale it is easy to program and enjoyable to use best of all it s beautiful to behold
0,i bought two of these as christas gifts one for my son and one for my nephew my kids have played with it a few times now and my wife and i are looking for an oppourunity to pitch the whole mess in the trash not only does this stuff look like sand but it gets into everything just like real sand the play mat they include in this kit doesnt come close to containing the mess on top of all that the stuff deosnt clump together all that well all and all i would reccomend this product only for childeren over and then only for outside play unless you really enjoy cleaning up
1,the new edition of w p is simply the best the new features the little extras you ve come to expect from w p the user friendly tool bars all make this a good investment
0,i ve seen the phrase slice of life used many times to describe this movie which makes me wonder whose life is this a slice of certainly not mine and not most people s the anniversary party is a slice of the lives of a group of people who are extremely vain self absorbed jaded and rich beyond most people s wildest fits of imagination worse there isn t much of a hint that the filmmakers were aware that most people or at least most people who are fun to be around don t act the way these characters do good films can be made about hollywood in mulholland drive it s kind of a dream world both in the sense that it s hazy and ambiguous and in the sense that one of its characters dreams of being a bigger part of it in state and main the self absorption of many of the characters is offered for our amusement the anniversary party is presented as if most viewers will be sympathetic with the characters but i can t imagine them elicting much sympathy from anyone who isn t also a bored rich prick if this is truly a slice of life for the hollywood set it is no wonder that so many films produced in hollywood are so cynical and shallow
1,finally a product that does as it promises excellent sun burn protection even in hawaii
1,i wish i could give this magazine stars finally an honest magazine for christians i am the target demographic so i understand the style does not appeal to all but the content can easily relate to anyone who is willing to get past their pre concieved religious notions and desire biblical truth i sometimes get sick of the relevant move because it frequently becomes used as an excuse for christians to abuse their freedom as believers but relevant does a fantastic job of giving a balanced look at relevant faith i don t always agree with every article but i appreciate the open honest and sometimes opposing views it is not a one sided or single minded publication i wish i could afford to get a subscription for all the christians i know
1,of all the karaoke games we have used this is by far the best it s fun to pick out all of the different outfits for the characters it has more songs than the previous karaoke game we have there are the are different options like duets and in sing offs you can see who can get the best score hours of fun fun fun
1,live alive is good enough to buy in my standered s i really think this was recorded poorly but the songs on it are really good if you play it in your car or on bigger speakers so you can really hear everything much better their are many good songs included on this complination of live performence s spanning from performences from montreux jazz festival austin opera house and the dallas starfest this recordings are all from through jimmie vaughan appears on willie the wimp love struck baby look at little sister and change it playing guitar and string bass i think the worst song on the entire complination is voodoo chile slight return which is kind of weird for me to say because i think that was truely the best song stevie ray played live but in this case its not other than that i really think for what it is it s a average live performence
1,this is one of the best business books i ve ever read mr nocera says it took him six years to write this book and i believe it the amount of work that went into this book is obvious this is an excellent piece of business journalism the annotations and bibliography are thorough and the overall writing and editing is top notch mr nocera covers a rich array of elements important to the development of the financial services industry over the last half of the century automated teller machines atms the bankamericard later visa outdated banking regulations black monday october jimmy carter s futile attempts to wrestle runaway inflation in the late s cash management accounts cmas citibank later citicorp deregulation of brokers commissions growth of american consumer debt as a result of runaway inflation in the late s america s cultural adoption of the plastic credit card from the late s through the direct marketing of credit cards to americans and its great success america s worship of star mutual fund managers like peter lynch during the s the ineptitude of america s elected officials to deregulate the banking industry in the face of dramatic changes in the financial services marketplace the amazing impact money market mutual funds had on americans savings strategies given the inflexibility of the banking regulation q that capped savings deposit interest at around while interest rates were as high as in the early s the significant growth and influence of fidelity investments and its leader ned johnson on the industry in the s individual retirement accounts iras and their impact on the growing wealth of americans the rise of nonbank banks and other non financial companies getting into the financial services arena during the s and s the pervasive impact and presence that andrew kahr had throughout the industry in creating new financial services products the pollyana ish impact of marshall loeb editor of money magazine had on middle class americans and their views of investing in securities the amazing record of peter lynch despite the ever growing size of the magellan fund the slowness of merrill lynch to change along with the rest of the industry in de emphasizing commission revenue versus asset management fees the dramatic growth of mutual funds in the later half of the century and all the billions the financial services industry makes from them each year negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts state laws on usury and how south dakota became the credit card capital of america schwab s onesource as the first mutual fund supermarket the dramatic risks of writing naked put options in just before black monday and how it impacted charles schwab co the impact of reagonomics on american wealth building the s bull market leading up to black monday the wild success of first deposit s first select card as designed by andrew kahr and the adverse reaction to it by consumers and watchdog groups paul volcker s anti inflation policy of ratcheting up interest rates in the early s and his general resistance to deregulation of the banking industry ted and nina wang s amazing margin calls during and after black monday the author does a great job of depicting the very interesting characters that led the money revolution in the later half of the century including dee hock of visa ned johnson of fidelity peter lynch of fidelity andrew kahr the product development consultant roger lawson of fidelity marshall loeb of money magazine charles merrill of merrill lynch president jimmy carter and his administration donald regan of merrill lynch and the reagan administration charles schwab gerald tsai jr of fidelity paul volcker of the federal reserve and walter wriston and john reed of citibank the writing is crisp clear and easy to read few books come out like this and mr nocera is to be commended for this first rate work if you are even mildly interested in any of the items listed above you will enjoy this book if you find the financial services industry fascinating and or work in the industry you will love this book it s a page turner the only drawback to this book is that it was published over a decade ago in so much has happened since then i encourage mr nocera to pick up where he left off and put out a second edition that takes his readers up through
1,let me just start this review out by making it clear that i am a huge basketball nba wnba cba fan i picked up this basketball and started dribbling it i was amazed at two things first of all it bounces really high and you very rarely have to keep pumping it up like you do with some other basketballs you can use it both outside indoors although it is geared for more indoors then outdoors second of all the grip of the basketball is very good so it won t slip out of your hands this has been the only basketball that i have actually owned that doesn t slip out of my hands to wrap things up i will end my review by making it clear that you should go with spalding and buy this basketball
1,i recently purchased the tent cot and decided that it would be best to have the rain fly to go along with it the rainfly fits snuggly with elastic corners also there are straps that attach to the ends of the cot with clips the sides tie down in four places to prevent it from flying around when you don t have it fully zipped up my only gripe and the reason it doesn t get five stars is that i think it should have just come with the tent cot in the first place rather than having to order it separately
0,we bought this item because we could not find what we were looking for anywhere else we had it about weeks and the piece that holds the nipples caps broke off and now everytime we go to set bottles on it we have to attach it back on not very durable

1,this guy is amazing i keep playing this for people and they love it and tell me they have never heard anything like it i even got a huge discount at the auto shop for just having this cd after the mechanic took my car from the parking lot and listened to one minute of this he came in and said that sounds crazy you have to let me copy this after getting a nice chunk of cash taken off my bill this cd already paid for itself and never collects dust i know everyone compares clark to aphex twin boards of canada and autechre but for good intentions he is already that good after just a few releases
0,i would agree with previous reviewers in that the burgeoning ads in this magazine over the past decade has made the magazine a chore to read the number of ads now easily exceed the number of pages devoted to articles it is also quite disturbing to note that many of those ads possibly or higher pitch ultra high end products such as viking ranges bmw s oceanna cruises trips to bora bora wtf although i do enjoy i a luxury meal i don t want to go into massive credit card debt purchasing products this magazine is selling ocassionally behind the clutter i find a useful recipe i rarely find an interesting article i am going to let my subscription expire at the end of the current period

0,this toy is not good at all its hard for the reflecters to stay still and to connect its hard to trace the picture because you can hardly see your hand plus it the picture moves thats it you have to start all over again its better if you just take a piece a paper and putting it over the picture and traceing it that way trust me i ended up just doing that

0,t mobile has the worst customer services sometimes it is the company s mistake and they still blame it on the customer since i started my plan i had a problem reciving my bill on time so the company start charging me late fee for four consecutive months also when i tried adding additional features such as their text message bundle the change on the account did not take effect till two days later and i was charged for cents for each message i used in these two days and it costed me an additional every time i tried complaining to their customer services they just wouldn t listen i am starting to get the feeling that they are just trying to maximize their profit more than once if i stay long enough on the line they put me on mute so they don t have to listen to my complaining i feeling that i am being treated like dirt not like a customer i had the worst customer services experience with t mobile also the reception is not the best in the country i had friends who were using the same phone as the one i have but different network and they were getting services in places where i don t have it and they pay about the same amount of money
0,no reviews available pre purchase set was totally useless laughably out of date poor color two disks had flasws at the ends i wanted to use them for a bible study group but wound up throwing the three dvd set in the trash the cost and trouble of returning for credit were not worth the effort zero stars but one star was the lowest rating accepted i exopected better of amazon

0,this seemed like a great idea but it doesn t work very well for cloth diaper users like me i use the top shelf for the wipes warmer and the side pockets for grooming items such as a brush and cotton swabs however since my cloth diapers won t fit into the diaper organizer i m not sure what to put there because of this there is a lot of wasted space i would not recommend this product if you use cloth diapers
1,david foster who wrote a few tunes on yes s time and a word is here on bass with tony kaye on the and it s the performance of their lives captured live at the rainbow a brave but good way to record a debut album album was produced by jon anderson and the cover drawn by roger dean just like yes it gives you feeling that tony left yes on good terms when rick wakeman stepped in

1,my side of the mountain is a terrific and educational movie i can t agree with some of the negative reviews here this is an interesting movie the whole family can watch together little sam gribley is a walking encyclopedia this movie would be good for classrooms watch it and learn i m going for the novel
0,usually jerry s scores for movies are priceless i e the other score for legend but rudy is a little bit too unoriginal and the feelings meant to be expressed seem much too forced for my taste it s ok as a weird sort of comedy album i suppose but from the main theme i was laughing because it s meant to be such a serious experience but isn t i think that only the biggest goldsmith efficianado could find joy in this cd
1,really nothing on this is bad the best imho is rubyhorse the brian jonestown massacre and the subways but a case could be made for any of the songs the only problem is now i have other cds i need to buy
1,the bottle itself is a real looker with thick rich smooth glass encasing golden rich amber jewel like liquid on the inside fancy shmancy i said as i took it out of the delivery box i opened the bottle to take a whiff and my oh my it s definitely worth the price tag the real test of course came at bath time and this sure delivered beyond looks alone the bath water turned bubbly and luscious with earthy aromas of warm primrose vanilla and the rich juicy and creamy finish of the apricot this should be eaten not bathed in insanely delicious as it would make a wonderful present for any friend or relative but better yet for yourself apparently this can be used as a body wash and i am really looking forward to using it in the shower as i m a shower person in the morning and this would make a tantalizing shower experience for sure i have reviewed a few of these bath items today and now i feel so sweet and sleepy after my bath that i feel extremely happy for getting this bubble bath it s little delectable products such as this one that bring you calm and pleasantness after a long day and nothing can replace some nice relaxation alone in the tub even my boyfriend loved the scent as he used it the other day so it can be for both men and women but i might have to hide it in case he secretly likes it too much
1,i received this stroller about a week ago and so far we love it the ride is smooth it s very light and i love the salmon color the shade comes in handy too it has all the features i d want while still remaining ight and streamlined it s a little awkward to close but i m a bit of a klutz so i assume others might not have this problem the handles are great though and they re very comfortable for my husband feet and me
1,after receiving my la crosse atomic clock i followed the simple steps on the back of the box and left it hanging on my wall overnight near a window on the west side of my house basically to set it up all you do is install a aa battery and press a button on the back of the clock to set your time zone et ct mt or pt the clock will do the rest overnight the reception of the signal appearently clearest during the night according to the instruction manual anyway the next morning after hanging it on my wall the clock was in perfect synchronization with the time shown on my directv satellite tv i live in the greater seattle area and had no trouble receiving the atomic timekeeping radio signal from ft collins co i d rate this clock a star buy the only slight downside is that the construction is inexpensive plastic not metal but then the clock would probably cost a lot more if it were metal note the manual warns that this may not work in the interior of a building also the clock probably won t receive a signal if you re inside a metal framed building such as an office tower wooden buildings with lots of windows will work best especially if you re far from colorado
1,the number of palatable gluten free cereal flakes is quite limited and they are usually quite expensive this cereal costs bag at my local health food store one needs a place to store a case of oz bags but it s worth it to buy from amazon com by the case
1,overall i m happy with the skin it fits the treo very closely this was custom formed for every curve bump and button on the treo my one complaint is they advertise it as compatible with the and i should have paid more attention to the pictures and thought about it the and p if you don t know are almost identical except for the buttons just below the screen the button layout is the same but they different icons and purposes well the skin has images on the button covers for the not the not a huge deal just a slight annoyance i m going to see if there s a way to remove these somehow
0,this is o k if you re using it as a restraint only if you want it to protect your child from the germs on the cart forget it i thought the bar cover would keep my baby from touching and chewing on the bars wrong it hardly covers anything i went back and bought the cart cover that covers everything i wish i would have spent the extra money before wasting it on this seat
0,i have ordered this coat times and returned both coats i m very disappointed this is supposed to be a reversible coat however the hem of the black side is too long consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed and it does not look good at all the company needs to revise this pattern
1,first off the company sent me a handwritten thank you note when do you see that in the age of computer print outs i thought it was an extra touch as far as customer service i will be returning to this company again the flavor is omg my best friend is hawaii so i often use the red hawaiian salt this beats its it has a subtle but great flavor i will buy again
0,i purchased of the aa batteries because of the low price of for the fine print on the battery indicates milliamps plus or minus percent so the range would be to milliamps after many days of refreshing the battery in my la crosse bc charger i ended up with the following milli amps so two of the cells are below spec earlier i had purchase some milliamp batteries from sanyo on amazon for about per four all of them were within spec i m glad i didn t pay a penny more than for four
1,for all of you out there who love destruction who love seeking sweet revenge on someone who knocks you out of a lap or tosses your sorry butt into the drink this is the game for you one of the basic foundations of this game is destruction even when you re knocked around beaten down crushed humiliated and etc you gain points with the craziness of your crash there are a few different race modes some of which can get a little tedious but it s all well worth it it s a bit challenging sometimes it seems like there is no way you ll be able to make that time limit or create enough damage but as you play you will find the way it s extremely easy to sit down with the controller in your hand and look up at the clock four hours down the road it s a very addictive game but is great fun i would recommend this game to anyone who is a racing fan without a question a star game
1,i looked at several therapy websites to find the perfect sized ball from my year old autistic son to use to bounce on everything was too big and too expensive this ball is just the right size and price and it was delivered quickly

1,after looking at the other reviews i was a bit puzzled i haven t had any of the problems other folks mention pdf converter professional doesn t do everything that programs costing five times as much money but who cares background colors in a business form why don t buy a camry and say gee i liked my lexus better most of you are going to buy this program to do one or both of these two things convert pdf documents into completely editable word docs excel worksheets or one of dozens of other formats combine documents of various formats into a single pdf picture a customer manual that consists of word excel solidworks quicken powerpoint and project documents you want to put them all together in one document complete with table of contents bookmarks and thumbnails voila this is the proram for you and for these purposes pdf professional is superb it is easy to use we have several users and not one has had to refer to a manual or on line support to put pdf converter to the test we recently scanned then saved as a pdf a crooked not highly legible fax we then converted it into a word document and roughly of it came through perfectly amazing highly recommended

0,after watching harsh times we wondered is this a comedy or are they just mocking inner city life we couldn t believe what we were watching it was meant to be the new version of training day they even got christian bale to play the lead role but only in the eyes of the people involved in it it was a miscalculation and we ll explain why brief story the movie takes place mostly in the dangerous inner city streets of l a jim davis christian bale is a mentally unstable young iraq war veteran now in the states he is looking for a job as a cop jim s best friend mike alonzo freddy rodríguez is also unemployed but when his friend comes to visit they prefer to hang out and commit all kinds of illegal activities selling drugs guns getting high just to name few to spend time with his friend mike has to lie to his girlfriend sylvia eva longoria making her believe that he is looking for a job she doesn t know the world of crime they are involved in and the terrible consequences they might face review harsh times has many problems but the most notorious one is the crime video game feeling it has throughout the film the characters and situations are so unbelievable that the whole thing feels like watching a grand theft auto or scarface the world is yours video game adaptation with a little bit of cheech chong in the mix there is no climax we just see them driving to different places arguing among themselves and committing all kinds of crimes without anything conclusive until the very end christian bale s accent in this movie doesn t help either not only it changes through out the film but we are not sure what kind of accent he is trying to emulate the dialogue between the two friends feels forced and teenager like also there is no chemistry between them the acting in this movie is disappointing especially from bale who we liked in movies like american psycho batman returns and the prestige it is clear that he was miscast this time he just cannot do what denzel washington did in training day because of his accent and terrible acting in this film we believe this is his worst performance to date this is something he doesn t want to add to his resume the verdict christian bale returns but this new american psycho cannot find his equilibrium harsh times tries too hard to create the edgy dramatic style of the dangerous inner city life that training day had but it doesn t even come close to achieve that goal we laugh at the silliness of the story overdramatic acting and christian bale whose fake accent in this film has to be the worst of the year he probably thought he was going to get nominated for best actor this is a miscalculation of great proportions by him and his agent
1,after slicing through the outer rine of this pleasently heavy fruit an irresitable wealth of naturally sweet goodness is revieled this swollen ovary is undoubtably the greatest variety of cantaloupe in existance there is no comparison to cantaloupes grown in other areas the california jumbo cantaloupe makes any other variety look like achondroplastic cantaloupe this copious orb of delictableness is a must have for any herbivore or omnivore
1,i love these eargels my ears are a funny shape and i can t wear regular earbuds but when i add these gels they fit great and don t fall out they block outside noise and make the sound quality like those expensive sound isolating earbuds sometimes i need a small and sometimes i need a medium depending on the day the weather and how long i use them i gave the large size to my boss and he loves them too so don t say you can t use all of the sizes guys
1,of the big fortune forbes and businessweek i like fortune the most businessweek feels like it s always copying someone or dying to jump on the bandwagon for the next big thing forbes is a good magazine but sometimes is so original that it veers too far from its original purpose to report and analyze the business world fortune profiles the people it chooses and writes about current events without just summarizing the way businessweek does
0,i ordered this magazine without really knowing anything about it i was very disappointed not enough recipes the recipes that are included are not really ones that i would use
0,my year old son got it for christmas he was really excited it is definitely a neat toy the whole family was into it however it only lasted one day it would no longer charge and i am just going to take it back because i am in no position waste just for one day

0,being an osmond fan can be very frustrating at times this cd has nothing new to offer there have been several osmond compilation cds in the past years what s so different about this one besides the photograph on the cover nothing i agree with the reviewer who wishes the osmonds would put some of their old albums on cd instead of putting out hit compilation cds all the time been there done that bored to tears
0,paying for shipping and handeling was a bit much
1,i bought this camera just before a trip to ca and then a cruise it is very easy to operate even for a techno retard like me and the pictures turned out great i have started to use the filming feature recently as my video recorder is with my son college and i want to film my daughter s drill team performances i really like the fact that it doesn t turn on while in my purse my old camera did that a couple of times and i ended up with quite a few pictures of the contents of my purse anyone want one lol all in all a great buy months later and the lcd display is gone literally gone don t know what happened took pictures movies of daughter s drill team performance and when i got it out again to take pictures before sadie hawkins it would still take pictures i just downloaded them but since the display looks like a piece of plaid fabric with a marijuana leaf coming in from the right side i don t know what i m taking a picture of need to replace soon i m now bummed
0,i measured batteries out of the pack of with la crosse charger which i also bought from amazon the capacity ranged from mah to mah with the average being mah that s about a third of the stated capacity before i took the measurements i made sure the charger works properly by testing it with two different brands of aa nimh batteries la crosse and energizer both scored very close to their stated capacity therefore the test is valid and sunpak s claim of mah is grossly overstated my advice avoid sunpak like the plague
0,people actually gave this movie stars are they for real if you want a good shoot em up action movie with lots of hip hop and blunt smoking then this movie is for you it is fun to watch but to say it is true to life is like saying cabin boy is politicaly thought provoking it is a fantasy about how rappers wish there life styles really are their are so many scar face ripoffs it s offencive and the conclusion is so weak it looks like they said okay we don t have much film left we gotta rap this up real quick dmx find religion and cut rent the movie try to figure out what the hell the jamaican guy is saying ignore the horrible acting of naz then return it and when you review it please don t give it five stars those are supposed to be for the cream of the crop not just some phat movie you and some down ass playas watched while moms was outta da house
0,i purchased two of these cases for my daughters ages and but we were all disappointed with them it supposedly holds barbies and their accessories but they are hard to close if you put that much stuff in they also come apart everytime the girls open them and they are hard for the girls to put back together they are good for keeping all the little barbie accessories out of the way i just wish they were better quality a friend of mine has a soft plastic case for her daughter with a zipper and she says it is great but i have not been able to find that item anywhere
0,my hunting buddy purchased a nikon my intent was to put him in the shade that nikon kicks the crap out of my bushnell yardage pro tried new batteries tried bluffing even tried to lie but nothing helped this product past yards my opinion is this product is not worth the postage anyone with similar opinion or someone that has had a good experience with this product
0,save your if you plan to run with this on a jogging stroller on a mild windy day it flips up towards you and off to the side i didn t think it really shielded my baby from the sun like i thought it was going to either i would not recommend this product it s very cumbersome when i returned it to the store there were two others on the counter behind the customer service cashier that had just been returned recently
1,awhile ago i was having a conversation with someone about musical tastes where we vastly disagreed on what was simply awesome bands and which ones were purely based around taste such as people who love r b and rap to people who prefer dance in a way texas chainsaw massacre as well as the exorcist and the shining are like the beatles and led zeppelin of horror movies you must love them and say anything different and you re going to get lynched so i will agree that the film is definately refreshing considering the latest crop of so called horror movies yet at the same time i wonder why it didn t hit me that much kids are travelling through the country and hear of a couple of houses they decide to check it out only no one s home seemingly at first pretty soon they meet leatherface a man in a burlap sac mask who wields a big fat chainsaw pretty soon the kids start going one by one and we find a family seriously depraved and having to escape alive it s odd how i can t say any more about the plot not because of spoilers but because there s not a lot else to say like many a filmgoer i can t stand the latest releases in horror instead of using atmosphere pacing and mood to creep people out they go for broke and show some of the more violent scenes this film isn t even gory at all in fact the film s goriest scene where one of the kids meets a chainsaw isn t even shown onscreen your mind fills in what went on which can probably be even more disturbing adding to the realism is that it s shot in a kind of documentary like style one problem i had with the film was that the dread didn t feel there there was pre mtv style editing and extreme closeups of eyeballs and maybe i ve just seen it before but it didn t creep me out like it should ve and having a woman scream for minutes doesn t help if i saw this in i mostly likely would ve been creeped out of my wits but seeing it years later it s more like yeah it was alright although i better not say so cause then everybody will bug me about it if you re a fan go ahead and buy it because it s probably the best release of the film but personally i m not
0,my son loves to drive cars i saw this and thought he would love it it is totally unrealistic doesnt make much noise which for some parents that would be a but in this case its not and it is not entertaining at all paid entirely tooooo much money for something that he will not play with at all i have tried letting some of my friends children play with it and they dont seem to enjoy it either
0,if you can actually get the picture to turn out right it does take pretty decent pictures most of the time the photo is either over exposed or too dark and grainy it also only holds about pictures so you will have to buy a memory card if you want to really use this alot i was a little disapointed with it due to the fact that it cost dollars and it doesn t really seem worth it
1,i purchased this for indoor use so it has worked great for what i wanted it to do everything works flawlessly plus it s a big enough size that you can see it easily across the room
1,replacement blades are a must the razor will remind you about once a year which is fine in most cases but if you have a heavy beard or shave more than once a day as i do then you should replace the blades every months or so the reminder on the razor is only a suggestion not a command after all it does not know when the blades get dull so i simply ignore the reminder and replace the blades when i feel it is necessary one thing you must do is use the new blades for several days until they settle in and adjust to your skin until then you may have a little irritation another problem i have solved is the hair on my neck i use to think the harder i press the razor the better it would get those stray hairs but all i got was a rash i discovered that if i simply use a very light touch and not press hard then it got those hairs much better and with no redness replace your blades at least once a year and your face with thank you
0,we looked for a trash truck that our year old boy could play with on the surface the bruder looked the part not as cartoon looking as some the fact that it looked like a real trash truck but had few obvious breakable parts made it seem like an ideal choice actual play testing though shows this product isn t very well built at least not enough to withstand normal wear and tear this truck wasn t subjected to being thrown down the stairs jumped on etc it s been just played with but it started coming apart quickly the hinged door in the back of the truck is a poor design the plastic hinges on the truck are too thin and break easily the plastic hinges on the door start to bend after multiple open closes and the plastic weakens and breaks off the hinged front compartment and rear sections are difficult to operate and stick easily items put into the cab like the essential green army man who drives the truck easily get caught in here and are very difficult to remove worse though is the key point of this toy the ability to latch the trash can to the lifting dumping mechanism this is way to complex for a child and the intricacy in getting a solid connect is difficult even for an adult if it s not hooked up right the can falls off when you try to lift it very frustrating some little pieces rear view mirror etc broke off easily and early on but we kind of expected this the parts were simply too small and fragile to last long i don t hold this part against the design part of the attraction was that it looked like a real truck and i don t think there s an easy way to add small details without some fragility while this is orignally was one of my sons favorite toys he can t really play with it the way he d like to while he still enjoys driving it around the house he can t pick up the trash and dump it without an adults help and that s a shame for the price i expected so much more
1,this gauge works well and is easy to read it seats well and does mostly what it should there seems to be a lot of misunderstanding from what i have read in other reviews let s clear a few things up first of all you do not have to wait ten seconds between readings you do have to hit the recall button on the bottom between readings secondly you do not have to send the unit back to replace the batteries the instructions very clearly state the model number of user replaceable batteries if you were to read the instructions the hose was flexible for me in degree weather contrary to what i have read elsewhere maybe it gets stiff in really cold weather but then i use mine in the garage very nice gauge
0,this item did not even work and for the price you pay i feel it was a rip off
1,i ve had this weather station for about a month now it seems to get accurate readings only if you can find a good spot for your remote sensor a bit of sunshine will make your readings higher than normal outside a couple complaints as one reviewer said the buttons make the unit feel cheap they feel clunky but i only used them to get it all setup so its no big deal i ve had some mixed results from the barometer when the actual pressure is mid range its right on i ve chcked some readings from local airports to see how acurate it is but when a low or high pressure system moves in the readings are off more than i d expect however the important thing is that you can see the pressure changing in the right direction lastly the forecasting model it uses hasn t worked for me yet i live west of denver close to the mountains this probably creates a local weather pattern that the unit cannot predict i did not expect it to but we ve had some rain snow and fog that the unit claims it can observe and did not it s only been a month so i expect to see a prediction that is accurate at some time overall i am happy with this product and think it is worth the money there were many other models i looked at and i think this gives the the most for the money
1,a great product at a very good price we are repeat customers so that says it all
0,i can t speak to how well the product performs because mine was doa customer service was unable to do anything over the phone since it was purchased as a gift and i had time before christmas i opted for a different brand doesn t inspire confidence in their quality control when a unit fails to start up fresh out of the box
0,the book from alex haley when i read it some years ago changed my life and views of people with color and everyone should read it yes even conservatives manditory however this movie something just wasnt good to long the over all acting spike you make some great movies summer of sam is one of your best do the right thing spike has a gift for cinematography however spike lee interview on espn the interview said interviewer kanye west said that bush doesn t care about black people would you agree with that lee yes i agree with that but i ll go one step further and say that bush doesn t care about people who don t have any money whether they re black or white i guaranteed you that if this same disaster happened on long island or let s say the hamptons you would have had an entirley different response from fema and his administration but you should have seen how he said it it was as if he was staring right into the camera with this smirk on his face the dude is bold man i ll give him that and i applaude him spike said either black white mexican or asian but what he didn t say was italians that dude has been getting flack forever for his dis n of italians in his movies they call him a racist all the time here was his chance to say something and he blew it just didn t happen to say italians no so he is a racist too and so are the africans in africa they never have liked white people either so what about that spike try going over their and applying for a job and while i am at the african americans in even baton rouge don t want the blacks from n o coming up their how come spike never said anything about that fkn whiners so many the world over give them a mic and let them talk and will put it on tv and let the world see it for the fools they are and ignoramus white liberals eat it up as its gospel and he is telling da truth
1,just wanted to echo what others have said that these batteries seem to really last i received a new camera and was using generic rechargeable batteries in it almost as powerful as the here and the batteries ran out after a few hours replaced those batteries with these and these just seem to last on and on am very happy with them

0,turn of the century continues to serve a most useful purpose months after i gave up on it i have a door that rattles if it s not wedged open and t o c is just big enough and heavy enough to do the job on its own i struggled oh how i struggled to try and even begin to understand some of the characters i stirred the pages wildly while i waited for the plot to thicken i fought against closing eyelids while the book became heavier and heavier i searched my abridged guide to good grammar to see if i had missed a couple of chapters explaining that sentences after all don t need a subject a verb and an object or even a permutation of two out of three i left it on the front doorstep hoping somebody would steal it i offered it to my neighbor so he could jack up his car i considered lighting the fire with it i wondered whether if i took just a few pages a day i could eat it and get rid of the evidence i offered it to my mother in law for christmas i took it scuba diving with me instead of a weight belt and then eventually voila the rattling door what a fine tome t o c is another few hundred pages and i could have used it as a sea anchor for the titanic
0,i bought this camera after owning an olympus digital camera for years i was extremely happy with my olympus but wanted something smaller that would fit in my purse or diaper bag since i m expecting this camera was such a disappointment just about every single picture i took had huge white blobs all over it this only happened when using the flash i must admit the camera takes great pictures in broad daylight without the flash plus if you used the zoom at all the pictures came out fuzzy the first digital camera i ever owned years ago took better pictures the store i bought the camera from wouldn t take it back because i waited two days past the day return policy so i sold the camera and took a loss i d much rather lose than keep this camera
0,the text gets stars for the orientation organization and the on line resources for the text it describes exactly what you would want in an applied corporate finance course unfortunately i have to deduct stars because the text contains too many typos and smple calculations which i specifically want my students not to make this has been frustrating for my students as well as myself however i am confident that when this problem is cleaned up the book will be among the best applied corporate finance text in the market i strongly recommend a new corrected edition
1,this is a great game in which yoiu get caught up in the action it s almost as if you are there
1,i have banged my watch against all kinds of hard surfaces and am pleased to say that this thing is built tough everytime i ve accidentally hit it against a counter top or wall i worry that i might ve scratched it but everytime knock on wood it s come out clean another good thing about this watch is that it s light for a big watch it doesn t weigh me down like a stainless steel model i ve gotten many compliments on it i love it
0,even though amanda is quite attractive the camera work is bad the lack of professionalism throughout make this naked yoga dvd a bitter disappointment there are few close ups and when the camera operater tries to get in close focus goes out the window a bit of rehearsal may have made the actual yoga scenes a bit better if you are looking for an accidentally soft focus dvd of a relatively pretty young lady doing joga naked while she discusses what she is to do with the photographer and looking lost this is for you
1,i have recently purchased this item i think that it is cheaper to by the new tube than buying patches for holes in a tube

1,ah yes it s nirvana s nevermind cd released in i listen to all s pop metal or hair metal whitesnake winger van halen y t dokken i could go on forever on s bands of course there is rick springfield and john cougar mellencamp i am a true rocker here i know all the true bands out there i know everything about them i have reasons for this but here s the bottom line nirvana was a breakthough along with soundgarden and pearl jam back in the early s millions of people bought those cds and yes there were hair bands still alive back then like poison and firehouse etc firehouse and poison had alot of success eventhough it wasn t the s anymore as i can see alot of my fellow rockers don t really like nirvana or pearl jam or soundgarden to be completely honest i like their music i just don t prefer the music because i don t like the hard sound i really like the glam hair band style people say nirvana and those other grunge bands killed glam metal yes i agree that they killed the s hair bands but it s not necessarly their fault it s a mix between the bands and the people listenting to the music because of grundge music today s music is quite horrifying with emo and other types of music that would ve been a nightmare back in those days nirvana has a great cd here but i just don t prefer it if you are a real rocker you ll listen to all the types of music back then don t judge unless you have actually heard it because you may actually like it to all rockers don t listen to modern music it s poisoning our people and no one really understands the true meaning of the guitar in today s music most of you will understand what i mean so listen to the classics classic rock and hair bands forever and even grunge keep the classic alive the sicilian axe ma

1,after reading the other reviews i had to speak up i ve tried it all the garage bump the stop light type system etc you mount this unit on the ceiling and point it to a specific point on your car so you know where to stop in my case i point it at the dash when i enter the garage the laser turns on and because the laser is very bright you can follow it as it tracks along your hood if you set it up right this helps you set the distance between your cars or the side garage wall for example you can set it to run only the seam of your hood or the middle crease if you have one then when it reachs the dash i watch for it to land in a specific area and stop a successful park usually with only an inch or two variance it so rocks
1,some days after the kids leave the classroom i find myself reaching for the nearest available chocolate not any more this is a great healthy snack that satisfies the cravings and keeps me going for a few more hours and there are no hidden ingredients that set off my food allergies which i really appreciate they are maintaining their freshness well i bought them for the price but am now going to try the other items in betty lou s kitchen
0,although this dictionary s contents are extensive the screen functions are relics from the dos era they are laborious and clumsy to find a word for difinition it has to be spelled perfectly there s no list of proximations to the word entered changing a word selection is also clumsy especially in the thesaurus when the cursor doesn t show up in the entry slot if someone knows of a better software i d sure like to hear cause this thing sucks maria mcgowan

1,i exchange audio letters with friends and this stereo recorder was purchased after my sony dvs died and no replacement parts were available the sound quality is perfectly fine though it does not pick up ambient sounds nearly as well as the old high end machine it comes with a stereo microphone but it would be great if the microphone were attached to the unit as it is there is a long clip on cord this makes it tough to do off the cuff recording overall a good value for the money the other machine cost nearly
1,i purchased this at my year olds request for a birthday present i was skeptical but since it was the only thing requested i bought it we ve had it weeks what a great pool toy kids love it we have a foot above ground pool and it works fine i have bought floats for upwards of dollars so for the cost of the wave cruiser you can t go wrong it seems to be well built and sturdy i wouldn t hesitate to get on it takes d batteries that are in a water tight case it will tip over as will any pool float when the rider gets rowdy but that seems to be part of the fun for the kids overall great gift idea
1,this item was fairly easy to assemble would be easier with people but i put it together in less than minutes it was easy to mount onto the roof rack as well bought this for a long car trip but wanted to take a trial run with it of about miles round trip on the trip we ran into some rain and a couple of quick downpours the carrier held up well i had a couple of drops of water on the inside and that was my fault it was obvious that it was from the unused holes in the bottom for attaching it to the roof rack and i forgot to use the covers for those holes overall it help up great and expect it will do well for our trip to florida
1,this is one of my all time favorite cds i loved all the songs on this cd except one my favorite is black girl pain and it should be an anthem and inspriration for black women all over the globe i had the pleasure of seeing talib in concert a few months ago in atlanta and his live show was even better than his cd true hip hop lives
0,i would not reccomend this product it was cheaper at amazon com than walmart but it took forever to get it took two weeks for us to get it when caption said ships days than when we did get it several pieces were broken major pieces when i called the company which i was on hold for minutes then told me that we had so many pieces that were broken that we needed to return it i told them no it s over lbs and i am preg they then changed the tune and said they would ship the parts they would be here in weeks another mth so it took almost mths to get this product it is not worth the problems plus nothing was labeled and you had to figure out what pieces were what plus the shelves inside the unit are white the armoire is natural but the shelves inside are white i called the company and they said this is true
0,as a teacher i use word powerpoint and publisher when working with students and engaging in professional activities presentations to organizations etc i have been using office and thought i should upgrade big mistake the ribbons of icons are frustrating to scroll through especially since i previously just customized the toolbar so everything i needed was immediately available i m still trying to figure out how to type in chinese although the spanish and german are working fine additionally they ve come up with a truly ugly color scheme for their ribbons icons etc as a previous commenter noted making changes to the basic template creates extreme problems and i also was unable to get the darn number bullets to renumber it took me almost twice as long to write a test as usual and i ended up doing manually what used to be done quite easily using the toolbar the designs in publisher are now very difficult to see and differentiate in previous versions you could see the stark differences between different designs in the current options pages everything is so soft both in line and color as well as being so small that it s hard to tell what you re looking at but the truly big disappointment is powerpoint their new selection of slide designs has all the appeal of rotting road kill i would be embarrassed to give a presentation to a professional group using what is available in i have reinstalled my programs i feel like i just wasted all the money i spent on this suite my suggestion if you absolutely have to have a pc because you do a lot of word processing stick with word or if you need to do presentations brochures etc for your business get a mac and avoid this problem altogether
1,this is a good package for backing up your pc fairly intuitive although it took me a couple tries to figure out what the software was doing so i could select the right stuff to backup it uses good compression to minimize the amount of disk for your backup the downside of that is you can t just select a file to restore you must go through the restore process you can select a single file but it takes a bit of time runs automatically and unobtrusively so it won t interfere with your current work
0,it puts out a cloud of water vapor and it s not all that noisy but i had no idea i d be spending so much time each day taking the humidifier apart wiping it down trying to insert my hand inside the tank to wipe that down refilling the tank twice a day and wondering why this humidifier doesn t have an automatic shuftoff in case i forget to turn it off at least the filters and cleaning cartidges are easy to find however this is too much like an unwanted hobby so i ll be looking for another way to raise the relative humidity in my room

1,gotta say i love this step and even more so the deal not only do you get the step but you also get four raising blocks and a step workout dvd all for under i think that s a bargain compared to buying the pro equipment i think it was for the pro step and for two raising blocks plus for a dvd that s like the step is smaller than the steps you re probably used to from the gym but it s not that much smaller i would say it s about shorter length wise it s gotta be though i mean it s an at home step so they re making it more storable i guess if you re a big person it might be a little frustrating at first but i don t see how you couldn t adjust to it then again i m petite so for me it s the perfect size haha p the dvd is pretty good it s pretty simple basic stepping though so if you re an advanced stepper you ll probably get bored real fast however it does get you to sweat a little so it s not a complete waste if not for the stepping though keep it for the abs workout omg it s amazing for only minutes it really makes you want to commit stomach suicide haha which is a good thing because the next day your tummy is sore but flat but really it s a good dvd especially for those lazy days that you know you need to workout but don t want to at least not too hard lol buy this kit it s a great deal and it ll get you in shape

1,if you love dancehall this movie has a bit of a surprise for you ninjaman elephantman nitty kutchie boom dandemite harry toddler and cutty ranks all have roles in this movie which is a cop versus gun dealer type flick the dvd is full screen and shot in cheap video format but it still shines despite these flaws the soundtrack is very good despite containing no tracks from the aforementioned artists i wonder if this is what ninjaman has been doing lately because he does have quite a substantial role in this flick and doesn t do bad at all at the acting thing
0,i purchased crazy croc even after reading all the bad reviews but my son really wanted it so i bought it for him for christmas anyway it was the worst gift i ve ever bought please don t even waste your money trust me check the reviews first now that s worth it
1,there s a lot to like about lenswork the selection of images the quality of the printing bill jay s end notes but the thing i like the most is that there is almost no discussion of equipment brooks jensen the editor publisher doesn t appear to care what camera you used to make a photograph or how many miles through a raging blizzard you hiked to make it all that matters is the image and after you ve finished looking at the images you ll find a lot of wisdom and practical information packed into each issue too highly recommended
0,this went up from one in tribute to the neat hammy acting job from alec guiness as charles ii but otherwise its just a mess the film called out for a screenplay by a robert bolt or a john prebble but instead it was penned by its director kenneth hughes who also gave us such film masterpieces as casino royale and chitty chitty bang bang richard harris is his usually unrestrained self and thats not a compliment now i wont even go into the politics which attempt to portray oliver cromwell as some sort of liberating hero as ridiculous a take on the english civil wars as alexandre dumas s paean to charles ii in twenty years after but nowhere near as entertaining

1,my initial reaction to this magazine was that this magazine is huge and full of ads i also read vogue though and to be honest w has less ads in it w convieniently avoids the snotty air of harper s bazaar and vogue while at the same time avoiding the trashy how to sex up your man type articles in cosmopolitan redbook and marie claire and it also avoids the rampant celebrity worship of instyle this magazine has excellent layouts and from what i ve read thus far excellent and very different stories as a regular vogue reader i m used to reading about older designers like coco chanel the versace and prada lines and reading about a small smattering of socialites like aerin lauder paris hilton jemma kidd victoria traina what is different about w is that it profiles the new and the modern an article in the september issue profiled kate spade and her new line other articles talked almost sarcastically about the latest exploits of the socialites meanwhile talking about in an article aptly titled a bag called it the trend of statement purses and their proper place w is also similar to vogue that in addition to the good layouts it has even better photography there are no photoshopped to death photos in here and if they are this student can t find them what i like most about w is its sarcastic wit something that is lost in most magazines many of which these days assume that everyone wants to learn the latest way to sex up their man worship teri hatcher or read dumbed down articles
0,this is an excellent film which unfortunately has not been given a decent treatment by the distributor i was very disapointed in the quality of the release the picture quality is poor inter titles appear to be missing and the score which has been added is just a repetition of long synth chords that don t match the action on screen it s a shame because a film like this one deserves much better

1,after seeing this in a magazine i decided i had to try it so i ordered a small sized tub from sephora omg what an amazing change to my hair i am a perpetual hair dyer and last year had a perm that i then straightened because i hated it top that off with living in hawaii prior to that and between the color sun and perm my hair was getting a little sad this stuff is amazing from the first time i used it my hair was shiny and very soft i call it the dirty hippy hair stuff since it smells like incense i would definitely recommend this product to anyone if you don t want to pay the sephora or qvc prices buy it on ebay i have a found a seller there that sells the large tub for cheaper than what you buy it at sephora for
1,i liked this positioner because it came with an adjustable head piece my baby kept wiggling up to the top of the headboard and this piece kept him from doing so i also liked the fact that as my baby grew wider i could adjust the wedges one more thing this comes with a mat this saved me from changing the sheet because he puked up so much i bought two and would flipp flopp them when he would get sick
0,since this is one of my top four all time favorite films and i love films passionately i am absolutely beside myself in fury and anger at the horrible packaging on this magnificent film i could forgive the lack of extras i know a lot of people working for these international movie conglomerates don t give a damn about the classics or even movies in general really but the lack of thought that went into the packaging of this truly great perfect scene by scene shot by shot movie is staggering not only do they include a throwaway line of dialog in the middle of the images not only do they clutter it up with a bunch of extras from a scene in the boxing ring they picture the villianess not the heroine with the hero where is the original poster art the insert art the half sheet art the reissue art there isnt even a booklet or flyer inside nothing this looks like a release that belongs in the cheapie bin with the public domain stuff columbia pictures i am shouting at you
0,the description for this cartridge says that it provides continuous protection against mold and bacteria with its aquastat antimicrobial technology if you read the literature that comes with it however it says that it prevents microbe growth in the cartridge not in your humidifier it s not an antimicrobial cartridge it s a demineralization cartridge whoever reported that it removes slime must be imagining it

1,the freshman is a very funny movie the central joke is that marlon brando plays a godfather type figure in lower manhattan who for obvious reasons looks exactly like the titular character brando so famously portrayed matthew broderick is the freshman an innocent nyu film student who through some comedic misadventures gets involved with brando and his family the funniest scenes involve a komodo dragon loose in a new jersey shopping mall though the whole film is a delightful comedy the movie has no real violence and though there are a few mild bad words the movie is fairly appropriate for viewing by older kids and families
1,highly recommended my wife uses this pack for nursing school as you can imagine she carries a lot of stuff this pack makes it a lot lighter on the shoulders than a normal pack would because of the padding in the straps i would recommend this to anyone who is a student and is looking for a durable pack for school
0,sorry to disagree with all those reviewers who loved this movie but peter sellers did many better films than this dr strangelove was the masterpiece being there is an underrated and understated sendup of how things happen in washington the world of henry orient at last on dvd is priceless but virtually unknown with delicious performances from sellers and especially his teenage tormentors finally the pink panther series is much better slapstick than after the fox which has many famous talented participants but is mostly silly unfortunately not as hilariously and frenetically silly as clouseau co one irritant was the repetition and prolongation of gags and situations as if we might not notice them otherwise i agree with other reviewers that victor mature does as well as possible with the role he is allotted and martin balsam does okay with his stuff too when watching this film i kept thinking the same thoughts as when attending a mediocre restaurant i could have cooked up something better than this myself for a lot less money
0,i purchased this item for from comp usa there was a problem with some of the files so when i finished installing it my computer was a mess i lost all my desk top icons and my computer was extremely slow to respond to anything else it took me a while to get the program removed and i eventually ended up doing a system restore when the screensaver came up it did look awesome i wish i could have used it but i am not going to try and install it again

1,in truth there really hasn t been a great mana game since secret of mana back in every mana game since has been met with astonishing mixed feelings and children of mana is no different why did i buy it knowing this for the same reason many mana fans continue to invest in mana games there s always hope that the next installment will give us the same joy that secret of mana did unfortunately children of mana does not do this it doesn t rekindle the magic secret of mana gave us but that shouldn t suggest it falls short of it either the world is in peril when a mana imbalance threatens to send the world back into the dark ages it is up to a hero or heroine to stop this from happening and thus you ll set out to save the mana tree and the world itself children of mana by no means has a great storyline going for it at least where it falls short in story it more than makes up for in gameplay no matter how you look at it children of mana is a dungeon crawler it is an rpg but it falls into the dungeon crawling category when you enter dungeons they re just swarming with monsters and you ll be surrounded before you know it so you ll have to make your way through a dungeon battling everything in sight until you reach the boss take him on and then you re done rinse and repeat the process does at times become annoying but children of mana offers some variety and interesting aspects to the gameplay to make up for it the first tidbit of interest is how combat works it s actually pretty fun to go through dungeons killing things it s surprisingly addictive for the first couple of hours you ve got three hit combos you can perform on enemies you can knock enemies into other enemies there s quite a bit of intersting things you can do however what also sets it apart from a lot of dungeon crawlers is that you can t ahead of yourself too fast first and foremost you can t equip and use everything you find right off the bat the game will actually restrict you from using overly powerful weapons until you have access to certain dungeons or until you meet certain expectations this keeps the game from being too simple you ll also have access to magic of course each time you go into a dungeon you can take a spirit with you and use the magic that spirit provides for you it s interesting to play around with as well in dungeons you can also dual wield weapons although not in the way you d think when i say duel wield i specifically mean you can equip two weapons but only use one each time so you can t go about swinging both of them at the same time which probably would ve added more variety to the gameplay otherwise along the lines of giving your character a different assortment of weapons you can also give them gems that can improve their stats or combat abilities it s interesting but not really all that deep you ll mostly find or purchase these gems another interesting aspect is that the game is completely linear should you decide to dwell into the many sidequests the game has to offer children of mana is not shy about offering you side missions to go on and they re actually pretty well worth it the problem with the gameplay however is that this rinse and repeat formula becomes very tiring very fast the objective in just about every dungeon is to find what s called a gleam drop and then bring it back to the gleam well it s annoying mostly because each dungeon plays out in the same way fight through a horde of enemies retrieve the gleam drop fight a boss and leave over time it becomes increasingly repetative however children of mana has a great remedy for that too it s multiplayer up to four players can play at a time and the game is so much more fun that way you and your friends can make your way through dungeons together and sometimes it s just a blast to do there are moments of slowdown when playing in multiplayer mode but it s nothing to get too frustrated with because it doesn t happen too often the multiplayer alone adds a lot of variety and complexity to the gameplay as far as graphics go the game doesn t look too bad the sprites look like they re ripped straight ouf of sword of mana and the game is completely however the mana games have not been about taking graphics to the limit they ve been about its unique art style which in children of mana is absolutely gorgeous it s artwork is just beautiful to look at each environment is given extremely good detail the only problem as i mentioned are that the sprites are not nearly as detailed musically children of mana sounds fantastic it s one of the best sounding ds games out to date very few of the current games hold a candle up to it s fantastic soundtrack the bottom line is simple children of mana is a very fun game to play with a very mediocre storyline there s just enough variety and interest in the gameplay to keep one going for the adventure even if the storyline is just not all that great to begin with however keep in mind that children of mana really is just a dungeon crawl and it s uncrealistic to expect an rpg that s all about dungeon crawling to have a fantastic storyline that will blow you away on the whole if you re looking for a game that s fun you ll find it with children of mana however if you re looking for a game with a deep storyline and endearing characters you won t find it in children of mana the good beatiful artwork fantastic soundtrack there s a lot of variety to the gameplay multiplayer is a blasts tons of sidequests to do the bad the storyline isn t good the gameplay has a lot of vareity but it s hard to get past the fact that it s repetativ

0,i had several friends insist that i rent this film i m glad i did instead of buying it i was not bowled over as they obviously were quoting lines from it and all but wetting themselves remembering scenes from the film now i m not a hard guy to make laugh but there was only one point in this film where i actually laughed out loud other than that i found sordid lives to be just tediously amateurish and more than a bit forced i love southern humor and even poking fun at southerners i can t tell you how much i love greater tuna fried green tomatos steel magnolias etc but this just didn t cut it for me the cast is a who s who of excellent character actors beau bridges bonnie bedelia leslie jordan olivia newton john for pete s sake erik krieger delta burke and gobs of others no it s not a shortage of talent that this film lacks i found that it was a lack of a cohesive direction that made me wince more than once there s a scene with ty an out of the closet to everyone but his parents young man who lives in west hollywood talking to his ex girlfriend in the reception area of their therapist well as a theatre director i can only tell you that the performances during this one scene are so painfully badly acted and the pregnant pauses between the lines are so large you could drive fleets of trucks through them there are various filming techniques that del shores the director uses that are just hackneyed filming from behind a person s back so that only the back of one person s head and the facing person are seen why it feels like a testimonial video from mtv s real world rather than an actual film frankly and this is not always a bad thing the whole film felt like it was a play converted to film it can be a great thing look at altmans come back to the five and dime jimmy dean and you ll see how a good stage to film movie is done but this well it s just amateur hour from my perspective in all the film felt like a poor man s greater tuna two quick change artists playing characters living in texas smallest town which was a stage play and was filmed for hbo as a stage play rather than attempting to make it feel like a film i wanted to like this film but i just didn t

0,as i watch the videos of my kids on my plasma lcd and mac trying to convince myself that i like the quality my wife walks by and says fuzzy i know most guys out there will know what i m talking about she just killed the deal regardless of the specs the wives don t lie the picture quality just doesn t cut it it s unacceptably noisey in all but the brightest of light and is an incremental improvement over my year old sony dvr the product design is cool the price is good the sd card recording idea is perfect but the hd promise doesn t come close to paying off if you re looking for sharp crystal clear images you re just not going to be happy with this camera unless the gathering of technology and low price are enough to cause you to settle
0,some will mistake me for a evidence hater but i m really not i just want the man to put some effort into what he does i m tired of taking just any ol thing artists throw at us nowadays because the fans don t expect very much or simply don t know what good is anymore sure you can relate to what evidence is saying but you can put on a dope instrumental cd sit with a friend or knowledgable hip hop head have a discussion about any topic and the resulting feeling will be something like the feeling you get from this album i quickly get tired of the slow flow see talking and i feel like anyone can do it i don t shell out money for things i can do myself really the only difference between him and cent is content when i hear someone say slow flow my mind translates that into reduction of standards to make it easier for cats to get on because this album would have been thrown out the window before the jiggy invasion came and lot of these beats though very dope are as slow as his flow is couple that with the fact that there are a lot of wack guest appearance from cats like joe scudda i m sorry i tried to like him but dude is simply terrible big pooh same goes for him and madchild and you have an album that can have a drowsying effect on the listener the only dope guest shots come from phonte planet asia and slug yeah i know the fans and jock riders will hate and call names but i m going to keep it honest fu real when ev actually puts his back into it he creates some dope material down with new york city is nice piece of work that has ev gettin busy over an air tight jake one track chase the clouds away is another track where ev does his thing over a pounding alc production the standout to me had to be line of scrimmage which features ev and atmosphere frontman slug getting nice over another dope alc creation with the likes of alchemist sid roams jake one dj khalil babu and evidence himself providing dope beats i d have to say that the production is definitely the strong point of the lp simply put i don t recommend playing this cd while operating heavy machinery i respect ev and his whole crew hell i love rakaa but this album will make you nod off instead of nod to the beat i can only call it the way i see it regardless of whether or not the artist is a favorite of mine or not bring on the unhelpful votes if you want but i can only recommend this to the die hard fans who should eat this one up everyone else should download this and test it out first standout tracks letyourselfgo feat alchemist phonte a moment in time feat planet asia line of scrimmage feat slug my favorite and down in new york cit

0,i have used both paperport and paperport deluxe for over a year so i am qualified to report both pieces of software have some form of severe incompatibility with windows xp pro i cannot really get version to operate everytime i try its like cold molasses click wait wait wait wait and then lock up i m very experienced i ve been working with pcs since every other piece of software i ve loaded works very well except for paperport and in theory paperport should be fine because it converts all scans to pdf which is more or less a universal file format however theory is a lot better than reality support is nonexistent from scansoft if you pay the per incident you still do not get a solution the scansoft forum is always either not working another bad sign or it s full of people complaining about the software and lack of support unfortunately there are not a lot of alternatives but doqments looks promising avoid paperport unless you have money and time to waste
1,nancy drew last train to blue moon canyon before i begin my review will be spilt up into sections and have a in depth look at that topic if you hate reading medium long reviews or just don t have the patience i would not continue reading but if you want to learn the most about the product before you buy it you ll continue gameplay interface this is a point and click mystery the arrows and hands are simple and easy to use they also have made and improvement in the arrows since the last game the hands manipulate items or add them to your inventory toolbox when playing the game you also have a panel at the bottom of the screen including a inventory depicted as a toolbox which i think should be a backpack instead a camera cell phone and a journal help and a menu button other games have a coin purse when money is used in the game the main menu is pretty simple however the loading and saving a game is a little clunky and you can t delete saved games it also prompts you about your decision it makes saving rewriting games take more than one click for this type of game the interface is perfect but i ll knock off a star for the irritating save load page plot a fairly used plot in this series finding treasure but her interactive made this treasure finding story a little more interesting jake hurly a miner and owner of a custom built train falls in love with a young french woman named camille on the way to finding gold camille later dies jake possibly finds treasure but he is nowhere to be found and his now haunted train is found out in out in the nevada desert with the engineer dead many years later lori girard daddy s little fame seeking rich girl finds the train and puts it back into shape for a trip to copper gorge colorado she invites infamous guests along on the train to find out what happened to jake hurley and where his mine is using the clues jake left on the train a pretty simple treasure story this series often uses that story but in different ways now turned into a intriguing mystery good work her interactive the game also has some side mysteries like lori getting kidnapped and someone throwing an emergency brake both happen to be publicity stunts but you find who did those things only minutes after each event happened what i didn t like was there was not really a culprit because there was no crime committed the very end is when a crime is attempted after you find out who the culprit is the jake hurley part of the plot was fantastic but the sub plot s weren t very exciting characters i loved the characters but you couldn t really interact with them as much lori girard was one of my favorite characters i loved watching that dumb blonde trying to get publicity and how she always kept forgetting nancy s name since lori is the hostess she was probably the main character tino baldcucci is a great character as well he is a private investigator but all he really did to get such fame was being at the right place at the right time he is as conceited as lori you ll probably interact with him a lot more than john grey john grey is the first black male to be in this series he is the host of ghost hunters a cable show on the verge of cancellation about ghosts he s a pretty good character but not a leading role unfortunately then there is charleena purcell a romance novelist introduced in nancy drew secret of shadow ranch who is nice and very smart she is in the process of making her book that s on a deadline who you ll find out used one of lori s story ideas in her latest book without permission i like her better now then when she was in nd to bad she has no memory of that game and finally there is frank joe hardy these teenage brothers work for american teens against crime atac and who were invited because their dad was friends with lori s dad the boys were nice enough to invite nancy along as well i personally liked this addition to the game because you get to play as frank as a short order cook they really don t have much to do with the case they are just a good source of info i am looking forward to playing as them more in nancy drew creature of kapu cave i really didn t like how there was not a lot of character interaction in this game but when you did interact at times it was really fun that s something to add to nd and beyond setting graphics i love being on a train the feel was so exciting seeing the scenery pass by in the windows were great the cars were so detailed and beautiful i think my favorite place in the train was the projection car later you stop at copper gorge a little town in colorado there was the mysterious crypt and a museum taffy shop that was cheesy but enjoyable the crypt was small and there wasn t much to do but i mean in real life all you do in crypts is mourn the graphics were great very realistic its amazing how much the graphics in this series keeps getting better and better this was probably the most unique setting in the series i personally love trains boats and planes so this made me really happy puzzles activities the puzzles were fairly easy i liked how a lot of the puzzles were combined into one to find where jake s mine is what was disappointing was the repetition of the puzzles there were about four or five pipe sets you had to connect which got a little annoying you also had to retrieve a lot of items like gemstones tools duct tape a pen and other stuff i don t understand how they made finding the gemstones easier than playing an almost impossible game with tino to get a simple pen some of the puzzles were unique like camille s doll sorting puzzle and her favorite dance step playing camptown races on the piano and using metal slugs in a mathematical way to open doors on a scale but some of these activities needed no skill at all like combinations a word search and a two memory games this game had variety but also repeated some puzzles as well which brought down its score ending once you find out where jake s mine your sent off there to get a head start for a treasure you d think that after all the puzzles you went through you would think finding the treasure in the mine would be somewhat harder than everything else you open the entrance memorize a couple things follow some lizards and then use the info you memorized not that difficult if you are smart then you find the treasure and your so called culprit you wouldn t know this person is the culprit when he she finds you in the mine and talks to you but then he she loses trust in you and you get caved in then you get out i thought this was fun to do felt like a roller coaster to stop the culprit i liked the ending and what the treasure was but getting through and out of the mine was relatively easy although the culprit was kind of obvious i liked what the culprit s plan or goal was overall it was good ending yet a little easier than i thought it should have been overall this was one of the better nancy drew games out there definitely one to add to your shelf the flaws in this game don t affect the game that much as they could have if the setting was different the plot was pretty good and most of the puzzles fit into it i enjoyed this game a lot after i played it more than two times i think any game needs to be played more than two times to get the full experience some parts of the game are really exciting compared to other parts the repetition of some of the puzzles isn t too bad this game is outstanding but there is never going to be the best nancy drew game it really depends on your opinion add all these up and divide by s gameplay interface s plot s characters s setting graphics s puzzles s ending stars divide by categories stars thanks for reading
1,since the description says this product contains splenda i don t understand why the guy who posted a bad review would avoid amazon grocery products at all costs just because he apparently didn t read the description before buying mccann s makes great oatmeal read the description before buying anything would be my adivce
1,i love the storage bag it was large enough for my tree i haven t had any problems with it it s sturdy i didn t like the fact that the shipping and handling is almost as much as the storage bag
1,this invicta is a really nice watch but with some problems all metal surfaces are polished on this watch so they scratch very easily and quickly and the clock face is a bit too shiny in my opinion hard to read in direct light also who needs a dial on a chronograph instead of a dial but overall for this price a good deal and good looking
1,i have windows xp which came with mcafee i used both norton and mcafee but lately mcafee s updates seem to have giving other users a lot of trouble rather than updating the anti virus definitions etc i decided to try zone alarm where many users seem to like it i must say that from the moment i installed it the only problem i ran was that you have to completely unistall your current antivirus firewall etc if zonealarm is to work to date the software has worked beautifully actually i believe that my computer runs smoother and slightly faster i definately would upgrade or buy this product again check some of the sellers for the bargain prices i bought mine for which is a big savings from the zonealarm website it is worth every penny
1,great buy for bucks they look nice and fit well they are distressed but it is not as bad as i thought it would be from reading the other reviews they look nice with jeans and a dark shirt pretty comfy too
0,i tried fisher price s take along jungle swing then this open travel swing in both swings my baby would lean forward and fold himself in half in the seat the jungle swing was difficult to haul around since it didn t stay closed well and the palm tree was always in the way finally i bought the fisher price aquarium swing i found the seat of the aquarium swing to be deeper and it clicks in place so it won t fold over on baby and it is easier to assemble and haul around
0,i ve had my shaveer for about a week and have given it several opportunities to do well i ve worn out norelco shavers so this was a confident purchase i thought this razor grabs chunks of flesh and heaves it around the room as if the objective is to destroy my face rather than shave it i have tried to exercise the utmost care to keep this thing from ripping my face apart but it continues to do it at least times each shave and with nothing more happening than just moving to another place on the face i m going to decide who my worst enemy is and present it to them as a gift

0,warning spoilers abound okay folks i was flipping channels and came across a movie called the hole starring thora birch keira knightley and desmond harrington now aside from this terrible blunder i m going to tell you about in just a few more sentences the film was fairly entertaining i dig thora birch and her character was really well played what really shocked me though was my quick research after the film was over i mean i checked imdb rotten tomatoes and wikipedia although all reputable sources none mentioned this ridiculous mistake have you ever been so utterly sure of something so blantantly painstakingly obvious that it would literally take an entirely different alien planet to be able to even minutely comprehend the vast insipidness of its vacuous residents that s how i felt after watching this movie and realizing that apparently i m the only goddamn human being on this prosaic infantile planet who immediately saw the dimwitted aberration for what it was and what exactly was this stupendous error you ask well it s very simple i mean it couldn t get more common sensically moronic than this the basic plot of the film is four teenagers trapped in an old war bunker the movie begins with thora birch s rendition of what happened that her friend set this whole thing up locked them in the hole and didn t come back when he was supposed to she escapes and the three others die the story changes from what she originally told her psychiatrist to what actually happened turns out the only way out was actually locked from the inside and thora had the key the whole time the other teenagers die for various reasons irrelevant to the blunder at hand and she ends up telling the tale to her psychiatrist from inside the bunker in the end she kills the guy who set it up and plants the key on him the police come and find thora and her psychiatrist in the hole and after rebuking the psychiatrist mention that the case is now closed at that moment a flashback shows thora murdering her friend that set everything up and planting the key on him right after that moment i said to myself what the heck the door locks from the inside it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that either a the door was never locked or b someone had to unlock it from the inside alright those weren t my exact words but good god it s so obvious and that my friends has got to be possibly the worst film blunder ever
0,if you crave a gay themed film full of brooding obsession gloomy and very well done night photography the occasional graphic sex scene and metaphors so obvious even a high school film class could catch them then this just might be your cup of tea howewver if you are looking for a film that sustains its running time and subject then you are out of luck to be fair portugese director joão pedro rodrigues has made some daring choices here dialogue is minimal this might as well be a silent film with sound effects he s working one of the great themes the boundary between dream and reality and the dangers of ignoring that boundary there is the further theme of sexual oppression triggering further oppressions and yes there is more than a little boundage mixed in this is no mgm musical it looks good night photography lots of backlight and black surfaces either dull or glittering sergio played by ricardo meneses a garbageman in lisbon drifts further and further into his obsession with a hunky young swimmer and sergio is pretty hunky himself while not obsessing he drifts from one random sexual encounter to another finally he goes off the beam completely i won t go into all the details in case you decide to see it the problem is the same that so many self consciously arty films from greed to the unbearable lightness of being share their metaphors are too obvious here among others it s human and animal behavior sergio s best relationship is with his dog and he lapses into canine behavoir periodically and they are just too long o fantasma would make a pretty good minutes festival film at minutes it just drags particularly the ending with sergio wandering interminably in a landfill in a rubber bondage suit come to think of it kind of an echo of the equally tedious final sequence of greed i admit it i really haven t the patience for films that scream out how artful they are and have little or nothing except style attitude and angst style and attitude think fred astaire can be a winning combination unfortunately in spite of lashings of kink and plenty of existential hysteria this is not a winning film basically it s a bore
1,photos were excellent but photo print quality depends very much on the print shop for the same photo file it can look like a photo when taken to a below quality printer shop photos taken indoor with marginal lighting no flash used turned out to be yellowish battery life is very long despite its large lcd battery charging time is over hours too long photos files viewed on computer looks just great prints are great but have not tried larger prints touch screeen control is a delight and very easy to choose and set date on photo is red would be better if it is black and the location of the date is not at the far right hand corner
0,i got a choice of a free subscription to either parents or child magazine since i already got parents i chose child i will not be renewing when my free subscription is up the magazine is boring the articles irrelevant and there are too many kids fashion pages if you want a magazine about parenting kids go with parents

1,for a long time i avoided anything with gardenia like a plague it always smelled too sickly sweet to me this perfume changed my mind completely yes there is gsrdenia but its very light and fresh and unlike any gardenia you ve ever smelled try it for yourself
0,this game has a great design and excellent fun story but it was obviously not fully tested before it was released for the pc whenever there are more than about enemies on the screen the game has horrible clipping graphic slowdown issues this means the bad guys keep shooting but your guy doesn t respond quickly to the commands the clipping is so bad that sometimes i just wanted to find the ceo of activision and shove this game down his throat this can be a fun game just don t play the pc version borrow someone s xbox and play that version this is another example of a greedy developer rushing a pc port to market without bothering to make sure it worked right
1,i have used this pen and the uni ball signo which seems to be it s competitor this energel is consistently smoother than the on different paper surfaces at work the seems to need a moment to get going writing for some reason the energel is out of the gate at full flow both have tips but this energel seems to flow a tiny bit larger line than the their both gels i think but this energel flows more readily this pentel energel will be my goto pen for now and the future

1,i just purchased this album my first misfits album and every song on it rocks i especially like where eagles dare i just bought two more albums walk among us and static age and i wish they would hurry up and get here in the mail because i cant wait my only complain is the sound quality it sounds like they put a dollar store tape recorder in the corner and started rocking but i guess that makes it sound more real too metallica covered a couple of their albums on their garage album but it just isnt the same
0,worked alright for a few months i wasn t especially pleased with the shave quality i e skin irritation hair pulls i figured that this would go away as i was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads it didn t the bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair wasn t easy and resulted in breakage no doubt due to the cheap plastic used never again
1,really nothing to say about this product fast shipping good deal i like the style and the color not too loud
1,good news mike leigh fans this movie is now scheduled to be released on dvd on september according to amazon the movie is an excellent one sometimes unjustly considered one of leigh s lesser works it functions both as comedy and drama as it looks at the reunion of two friends from college several years after they have graduated and have been trying to find their niche in the world told in a series of flashbacks and in present time it shows how he characters have grown over time while many of their vulnerabilities remain a must for any and all mike leigh fans
1,this is a good product if you like your tires to look new but not too shiney it could last longer and attract less dirt though amazon shipped it pretty quickly considering it was for free

0,this is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now even appearing in one episode of leave it to beaver in the late and on the cover of one of simon and garfunkles albums of the late i ve owned several pair of similar boots by other makers including red wing some comments which apply to this style in general and not just wolverines pros the wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing working on concrete or walking long distances on hard surfaces also the non agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn t track into the house after doing chores outside the moc toe tends to breath through the seams so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot dry conditions a great boot for the desert and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers cons the wedge sole doesn t offer much traction for serious hiking on steep loose surfaces which i ve used them for but for which they really weren t intended gravel will roll right out from under them none of the several brands i have owned were water resistant at all walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily we used to say your feet get wet two days before it rains so perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the pacific northwest specifically the wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box they have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support the color was actually more of a brown clay rather than what i would call tan the quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good actually better looking stitching than my red wings however i was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather the leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than i have ever seen in any work boot thinner even than in many suede sneakers while my ankles were covered they didn t feel at all supported or protected after considering for a couple of days i decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for amazon the sportsmans guide they had provided a return shipping label in the box so i taped the box closed applied the label and took it to the post office i received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package and a notice of a credit applied to my account so while i m not very excited about the particular pair of boots which i received i do give good marks to sportsmans guide for a quick and relatively painless return i ended up purchasing the georgia spr farm and ranch boot with wedge sole also available through amazon for further details please see my review
0,these bootie slippers are terrible they don t ever stay on there s no anti skid on the bottom and are cheaply made i would give these stars if i could it was a complete waste of money don t bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are
1,this is the best review of the jfk assassination that i have seen there is still a large assassination industry which can afford to find documents that you haven t read and charge you with ignorance if you haven t read them and find more if you read them this gives a common sense overview that seems quite reasonable i trust it i am always willing to consider other opinions but the balance of evidence has always indicated that oswald acted alone it would be nice to have a new edition of this book
1,despite reading glowing reviews about this lens i was still surprised to see how well it performed the lens is so sharp you can get very good cropped pictures of running athletes from a distance of three quarters of a football field away shooting hand held with late afternoon light which will print a and still look like a pro took them if you want a tack sharp lens for indoor sports pictures and can t afford or otherwise do not want another long lens for outdoor sports pictures then you should give this lens your serious consideration
0,i spent days trying to get this installed i think the complication was that i had norton systemworks and wanted to add the nav on top of it well i finally got it done but not until i d restored my system to a backup from before i d installed nsw at that point i had nsw installed i had to manually uninstall that and remove tons of entries from the registry norton s automated uninstall failed over and over so i gave up on that and did it by hand then i installed nsw with nav when i went to install nav it was unable to uninstall the old version so i had to restore the system again this time i installed nsw without nav i was then able to install nav it is working now it just shouldn t be this difficult

1,not for the professional but gets the job done for the most part
0,i am leading a christian study group using popular films i was hoping this book could help me use film to illustrate some scriptural truth unfortunately the author was much less interested in a christian message than to make sure he took every opportunity to insult the church i know that churches have problems and hurt people but it is not as common as this author seems to assert he seems very angry at the church and for some reason all of western culture especially america living in n ireland could make one suspicious of religion i assume but despite his claims to be a chrisitan so concerned about commmunity he seems to enjoy tearing down more than teaching and building up it is a good study of film not movies he definatley comes from a critical point of view and not that of an average person but not very useful in the context of the church that s my take anyway god bless
1,the item was exactly as expected the packaging for shipment along with the other item i ordered was unacceptable a child could have done better
0,i received the remote this evening and have not been able to get the remote to work with my canon rebel xt camera followed the directions that were furnished with the remote to no avail it appears that this remote is defective
0,of all of the expensive gifts i purchased for christmas this was the one thing my daughter played with consistently the price is right and now they have free shipping the one bad thing is that the cards are flimsy and we wore them out
1,i gather there are some people beyond that darkness out there but if i don t look you in the eye it s because i don t see you i only see the darkness that quote is found toward the beginning of manufacturing consent and is taken from a lecture chomsky was about to give in an auditorium where apparently no house lights were available i m unsure if anything more revealing was intended by chomsky s opening comment although it s impossible not to read something more into it the breadth of information offered in manufacturing consent is manifold shedding light on two primary subjects one noam chomsky his life childhood his anarchist convictions which fueled his decision early on to place a lesser degree of import on an easy going comfortable career in linguistics in favor of an uncertain often tumultuous life of political activism and dissent two the oligarchy in which existence is ensnared the necessary illusions which are implemented to deceive and brainwash the populace tricking them into believing that they actually have a representative form of democratic government and indeed have a hand in decision making policy and of course the media a broad apparatus used to manufacture the people s consent ensuring that an appropriate percentage of the populace will be effectively indoctrinated and hoodwinked into supporting the agenda of the ruling class and its military power or will be effectively depoliticized tuned out and away from crucial matters which directly impact the quality of social and individuated life most of what is seen on television be it news sports situation comedies movies whatever the programming serve as little more than an advertisement for a specific mindset resulting in a strategically wished for outcome at one point someone asks chomsky how do the elites control the media he replies how do elites control gm because they own it look at institutional power as an entity they have their own news division in fact it s thee news division naturally those who comprise this power structure at all of its various levels understand that to serve the proper role especially if one wishes to get ahead is not to actively undermine the structure s agenda by telling the truth and revealing its own crimes manufacturing consent is a remarkable film you see chomsky interacting with all sorts of people students interviewers average people who he s inspired and even those who obviously despise him for daring to speak a truth which conflicts with prevailing media induced ideology one that their own self deceptive belief structure demand be untrue in order to maintain a delusional happy consciousness as chomsky asks do the facts matter or don t they for him it comes down to a single question can you look at yourself in the mirror another telling moment comes when chomsky is asked to recall a childhood incident which left an indelible impression he tells of a time where the standard fat kid was being picked on at the playground with everyone taunting him as someone s older brother was on the way to beat him up and chomsky was impelled to do the right thing so he went and stood next to the fat kid as a display of solidarity but was eventually intimidated and walked away he says the shame he felt for doing so never went away has always stayed with him and that the lesson learned was to never do that again and that you always stand with the underdog as any change must begin somewhere it is the single individual who will experience it and carry it through carl jung
0,it really deserves a rating non skid surface is a joke it is slick as glass tripod dog could not get any traction with single hind leg golden slipped off side and hurt her leg learn from my mistake there is nothing positive to say about this product
1,like stuart gordon s other venture into science fiction territory the underrated and ill fated robot jox this is a nifty little film that was plagued by production difficulties and failed to find a theatrical distributor which is a shame because its quite an enjoyable viewing experience everyone joins in the fun in this one with dennis hopper delivering some unexpectedly funny bits of dialog debi mazar and stephen dorff providing reliable banana support and charles dance having the time of his life with his horny half metal madman this excellent dvd offers a chance to see this little sleeper in a great looking print with a fascinating and funny commentary by the director
0,don t buy these batteries because they don t last long like energizer or duracell these eveready batteries ain t never ready
0,when one trips the safety key one has to power the treadmill off then on to get the treadmill going again this action looses all the time and distance information the keys fitness who manufactures ironman and a bunch of others help line confirmed that this is normal for their products i see this as a safety problem because many people will bypass the safety key by not clipping it on their body
1,my daughter received this as a gift from mommy when she was about months at first she was petrified of having the objects so close to her face but if you take off a ring take it higher your child will really appreciate the colors and enjoy the toy the only complaint i have is the mirror it comes with still frightens my child the mirror distorts your child s vision so i took it off and purchased some other hanging toys for it my daughter loves it she could be eating her breakfast or sitting in her swing and all she ll do is stare at her playmat a definite must for all parents
0,the opening strip scene is reminiscent of barbarella too bad those aren t basinger s legs though nerdy scientist falls for galactic beauty as presented by kim basinger i have never understood ackroyd s characters and keeping in form he is once again as unfunny as mud basinger tries so hard too hard to rescue this film but that s no small task considering the ineptness of this way silly film ok so she munches on batteries and thinks she has to cook everything in the kitchen at mealtime she seems a genuine betty crocker given that her favorite foods are nuts and bolts jon lovitch also tries to prop up ackroyd and this weak script however his contribution seems way overstated to me he doesn t have much to do funny are the scenes inwhere the teenage girl eventually decides that her step mother is not like other people basinger s character has a magic purse with an annoying creepy critter in it who tells her what to do think jar jar blinks i suppose it s ok as a backdrop for housecleaning but that s it flat and mechanical
1,wonderful cycling magazine for everyday riders the content is very well rounded covering racing touring commuting recreational cycling and mountain biking this magazine doesn t just focus on how to make you faster or how to get you to buy the newest greatest lightest carbon bike most of the equipment the magazine tests is geared for regular folks who can afford reasonable prices the only problem i have is the price in the u s
1,vanilla sky is either a disappointment when viewed against indie film standards or a happily confusing lark when compared to the unending deluge of big budget low minded hollywood that s released weekly on the plus side we find a movie that engages the viewer and the mind a movie that is certainly confusing at first sitting it is that rare commodity the movie we like to talk about later like memento or barton fink people will find themselves dissecting the minutiae of the film after it s over also impressive is the fact that tom cruise one of hollywood s famed pretty boys spends at least two thirds of the film either hidden under a mask or horribly disfigured not a role many other actors would jump to take on the down side vanilla sky a re make is basically an art house or indie film starring a big hollywood actor what could have been an interesting view on the hidden nature of man or alternate multiple realities or even a study on the nature of reality itself instead ends up like an art house rip off of total recall rating b c fyi when did the universe change so much that banky from chasing amy could get a lead role playing opposite tom cruise when did penelope cruz get the role of indecipherable speaker ala brad pitt in snatch or fenster in the usual suspects when did paul mccartney last have a decent single here with the title track
0,at the young age of julie barenson loses her husband shortly after he dies a great dane puppy is delivered to her home with a note from her late husband this part will give you the chills nice touch she names him singer and despite her frustrations with his size and clumsy mannerisms they grow to love each other after a few years of trying to get her life back together after her tragic loss julie begins dating men richard a handsome charmer who wines dines her brings her lavish gifts and professes his undying love very early in the relationship the other mike is a simple down to earth country type whose idea of a date is a burger doritos a couple beers at the local watering hole so who would you choose ouch i ll stop there with the comment that this could have been such a compelling story instead we are faced with trite boring repetitive dialogue throughout scatterings of viewpoint shifts and a very predictible plot i cannot believe this is the same author who wrote the notebook one of my all time favorite novels i ll have to admit the ending brought on a gush of tears in conclusion singer not only saved his owner but the book as well
1,this thing is great our year old loves it the working drawbridge breakaway wall for cannon fire and trap door are great considering the size and number of pieces it was remarkably easy to put together allow to hours for assembly but the directions are excellent only complaint is that some of the small pieces that don t always want to stay together some of the details will likely be missing after a few weeks overall very happy with it
1,the cover design is well made based on the requirements the problem according to me is the device not be able to avoid the dust on the lcd screen because of the openings on both the sides in my opinion compared to all other covers this is a simple design and will allow you to easily insert and remove the blackberry out of the case
1,got this watch for my one son for christmas but ended up going to the other son since his arm is on the small size and this is a pretty good size watch it is beautiful and well described arrived in perfect condition and had no problem requesting extra links using the fossil toll free and then the local store that sells fossils put the links in for me i went with a small dress watch for the other son everyone was happy
1,naturally with a name like buffy i would have tried this whether i like it or not i get these on a regular basis from friends and family who see my name splattered all over it lucky for me i like ever heard the expression soft as a baby s butt erm no easy simple to use obviously no messing with jars or bottles just go to town massaging those pesky areas i m convinced it works wonders on orange peel skin and cannot be persuaded otherwise

1,i first got this game about years ago for computer back then i had a really slow computer and it didn t work right i was so mad that i had wasted dollars on it it went on the shelf and waited there for years now i have a better computer and play it all the time the earlier reviewer said that the game was extremely difficult not so the guy must have obviously been a moron and not been able to figure out the puzzles because the game has an average difficulty and if he wants it easier he can play on padawan anyway the game is basically a first person shooter based game where you go around blasting storm troopers probe droids and more i suggest getting this game because i really enjoy playing it and i want to get it for xbox too
0,the first schwinn fitness that was sent never arrived because it was damaged in transit the second one arrived but does not work after calling technical assistance and being instructed to re examine the contacts which i did it still does not work this is absolutely useless they will have to do something

1,i don t know if it makes your hair shiny or not i never noticed increased shine however i do think it does it does a nice job it worked better when my hair was around shoulder length but it puts a nice curl in your hair and as long as it s not too humid out it stays in now that my hair is down to my waist it doesn t hold curl anymore just a little on the ends and if it s even a little humid forget it the main thing that bothers me about this set is the clips that hold the rollers in i don t know what they were thinking but they really suck they pull on your hair a little while they re holding the roller in and make you look an awful lot like madusa anyone who happens to see you will most certainly have a few jokes and laughs
1,we bought this to use with our ws to record a class we thought the stereo would result in a better quality recording in the end we set the recorder to mono hq because the speaker moves his head and the sound travels from one channel to the other good quality but distracting save your money and buy the mono mic the quality is excellent in either setting buy the way in case you miss it this mic does come with a cable to connect it to the recorder
0,i ditto the previous reviewer i thought these seats were adjustable was i wrong there is only position and that is practically laying down suck
1,this is a very nice watch the pink mother of pearl face is lovely to look at and the leather strap is very soft the date is a little small but the watch is so nice that i didn t even care the only complaint i have is that amazon sent me this watch with a dead battery inside i had to get a new battery on my own but as soon as i told amazon they credited me the that was great but they should have sent me a watch in working condition otherwise the watch is highly recommended even nicer than in the photo
1,unbelievably and indubitably a bona fide and fortified roots reggae album if you don t have firehouse rock in your cd collection and you consider yourself a reggae fan you may need to re evaluate what you think you know about jamaican music the roots radics especially the rythym section utilize with supreme efficacy i might add and epitomize the manipulation of space and time so often associated with reggae riddims on top of the radics the wailing souls add ethereal vocals while staying masterfully conscious firehouse rock is a beautifully recorded piece of audible jamaican history and an absolute must have

0,these big internet companies are so good at screwing their companies do you see how this scam works they sell fresh whole rabbit but when i order it there s no head or skin can you believe uh excuse me do you think a headless rabbit missing its entire skin is whole this is totally misleading i have contacted amazon times asking them to please send me the skin feet and head so i have the complete set and they have ignored me or sent me autoresponder emails that don t specifically address the missing head and so on what they do i m guessing is then resell rabbit heads rabbit feet and bloody rabbit scalps on another part of this website and it s all pure profit what a crock
0,we purchased this to make sure we didn t miss anything re stock options the program kept including a ghost set of options of a different type though they were not entered twice it took me quite sometime to get them deleted it also said we had to pay estimated tax next year which isn t true since we overpaid as we have always done too many errors for a tax program
0,this was called learning the hard way not to believe the hype and not to buy shoes on line the fit was awful there is no cushioning to speak of in the soles and other than looking good off my feet these shoes are useless
0,i recently bought this thinking i could use it to upgrade my ti calculator to my surprise i heard it was incompatible with xp i supposed the worst that could happen is that it wouldn t work as soon as i recieved the cable it said to go to the website so i went and updated the software specific to my calculator after the installation it asked me to restart after the restart i immediatly recieved a blue screen of death and luckily windows xp found out it corrupted a file in the registry and fixed it but were it not for that i would have to do a format i have not fully installed it yet as now i have started backing up everything as a just in case scenerio however i warn users that when buying this product be cautious as this is not xp compatible and may mess up your system

1,this is the best brand of slippers i have ever owned i have a cute pink pair that i slip into the minute i get home they have lasted for several years now and they are still in good shape these slippers are so comfortable and they stay on my feet without any effort they are very soft and keep my feet plenty warm and my feet never sweat in them even without socks this style runs large and i wear a size smaller than my normal shoe size in these slippers after wearing them the first week i noticed they got a little roomier but they still stay on just fine they are my only pair of house shoes at the moment i just ordered a new pair in a different style in pink of course and i have no doubt they will be just as good as this pair was to me try dearfoams and your feet will thank you
0,i bought this product for my children because it looked neat what they don t tell you is that the paint must be diluted before you can use it why not include the pre diluted paint but i digress even after thinning the paint the product hardly spins if we could get it to work it seemed like a neat concept but it just doesn t work i have no idea if it is because it needs very thin paint or the motor is weak or what we returned ours for a refund
1,i am a mild audophile and i love these headphones they have great base response treble and isolation if you listen to music on the bus on train while listening for your stop don t get get these you won t be able to hear a thing outside of the music
1,we pruchased this tent for our annual car camping trip in northern mi where weather is very unpredictable we ve had other tents that took forever to set up but this one was super simple i think it too two of us less than minutes to have it up and ready we loved the size of this tent plenty of room for our air mattress and gear the air circulation was great too even in the heat of the day we had a nice breeze keeping us cool thanks to a miriad of windows when rain came during the night we stayed dry though i would recommend sealing the seams prior to using this tent overall we re really happy with this tent especially for the price and plan to use it for several years
0,i am giving this one star only because it is on vhs and not dvd i don t even own a vcr anymore and had to watch it at someone elses house the day that they come out with all ten seasons on dvd i will buy them all and really wish i could now i just bought the pilot episode on dvd and am hoping that this will sell well and that they ll go on to put all the seasons on dvd already i know there is still a huge worldwide fan base who would purchse them
1,this product fits my camera perfectly and is not at all bulky a great safeguard from falls and the velcro latch provides just enough security
0,i don t really write reviews but i felt like i needed to say something about this one maybe its me but i couldn t get the pump to work so i bought a new basketball i bought a regular one and bought a pump i wish that infusion thing worked out because it would have been great to deflate it put it in my bag and then pump it up again at the court but my friend warned me they don t work so good i m just stubborn i guess that s my cents take it for what its worth
1,i purchased this cd during the lowest time of my life emotionally every track brought solace and comfort beyond belief especially the title track deep peace i would listen to it over and over bathing in the lush healing sounds each element from the perfectly balanced vocals to the simple piano and violin motifs is seemingly structured at a spiritual level this is more than ambient music it s true music therapy
1,this product came in excellent condition i think that the guy who got the bad one should have just returned it for another everyone is entitled to one bad one of the bunch the only assembly i had to do was to re adjust the plastic dividers i ordered it may and received it may very fast shipping i m very pleased
0,i love his voice but the arrangements are way too complex and stilted there are about key changes in every song the melodies are buried so far beneath his reinterpretations that one can barely recognize the songs i feel these affectations detract from the songs while his vocal gymnastics are very impressive the result just isn t enjoyable to listen to unless you are a voice student or professional singer
1,first of all this is a good game i have only played with two teams and i am going to have to say that the estimated time of game play for teams is off whenever i played it took at least three hours to finish and less if we decided not to finish the hardest part is getting the industry awards the game always ended with both teams going for their last award so that kept it close which is cool but it is the main reason the game takes so long also the board design seemed to make it so that we would land on on the map and music mix more than any other space most of the questions are pretty hard especially s it was one of the funniest moments during the game when my opposing team was relieved to know they were to get a britney spears question the relief turned into frustration when the question asked for one of the producers of her album and it was not the one that they knew it was awesome overall it s a good game it just takes a while to finish especially with the difficulty of the industry awards i hate landing on the s square and it seems to get like some bands more than others like the band buy it if you really know your music casual listeners don t really help their teams that much
0,i bought these thinking they were a good deal but now i have to agree with some of the other reviewers i bought of these and one year later i have four left that will take any sort of charge the ones that died maybe had six recharges on them each i also have several high end chargers that don t want anything to do with the ones that died on the bright side i have several lenmar batteries for my digital camera and they have been a after years

0,i had the la crosse ws professional weather station for years and it was never fully functional i had to return the unit times as well as do a store replacement once and i used the system for a year without the wind speed unit working i simply didn t want the cost of returning the system yet again the software is absolutely horrible and during the years i had the system there was never any software upgrades at all given how deficient the software was this was quite surprising for example there is no calculation of daily rain amounts or monthly rain amounts the system is too stupid to differentiate between days the date recorded to the simple spreadsheet database is always one day off yesterday s date is recorded today overall the software looks to be a high schooler s science project done the night before it was due if you re going to purchase a la crosse system plan on spending money on party software as well as allowing about of your purchase price in product return costs la crosse tech support is non existant call get a recorded message to leave your number they will return the call but they never do and i do mean never send an email and the same response none it s a very frustrating joke after years i gave up and purchased a truly professional system from a competitor my only regret was having waited years to throw in the towel with la crosse i give la crosse star only because there is no star rating
0,not really impressed with this product it applies okay but the colors look really bright and odd on the colors do fade over time and i do not recommend this product i like lancome s eyeshadows because they stay on all day and look really nice
1,much improved voice same great guitar slow album especially on his two remakes country sound on no reason to cry beautiful solo this cd would have been a stars had he mixed in a thunderstorm to the background of gonna rain today
1,note the amazon description does not include dimensions on the package it recommends that you measure first it fits smokers that are across perhaps including handles not sure and are vertically it s a bit big for my standard sized smoker about across so it is unflattering to its graceful curves but good enough to be useful it is cheaply made but looks like it will be suitable i will update my report if it falls apart in use like another reviewer said it is quite possible that a garbage bag would be enough to protect your grill the main advantage here is that it fits a bit better and has elastic to close the bottom a bit it probably looks a bit better if you care
1,i gave this watch to my fiance as a gift and she loved it can t lose with this one
1,cannes man was funny i don t know why this movie was in the drama section of blockbuster but it made me laugh out loud just goes to show that nobody knows anything in lalaland and movies are made by a bunch of nincompoops who don t know their s from a hole in the ground
0,the american dream is an appealing myth no doubt the idea that anybody can come from anywhere and strike it rich in america sounds great the problem as george carlin put it is that you have to be asleep to believe in it so instead of representing opportunity for everybody it has become code for greed at all costs and that is where belly comes in an ode to thug live and all the riches that come with it this urban drama stars dmx perpetually rapping nas and method man and they would have you believe that they earned their cash by selling drugs and pimping as opposed to selling out to record companies the story barely exists and seemed like a burden for the director who just wanted endless shots of people having sex and smoking drugs when the plot does poke its head up i picked up on a criminal enterprise that moved shop from queens to omaha once there the cops get involved and people start getting shot one couple tries to escape to africa but find it easier said than done and tommy dmx is sent on a mission to kill a minister but really this film is about selling a lifestyle that doesn t even exist come on now i ve known drug dealers in my day and they didn t live in large gaudy mansions rap stars do rather they live in shacks or their parent s basement if my response to the film seems lukewarm it is because it is the directing by hype williams isn t that bad he is able to capture some beautiful images and uses a few creative camera tricks the lighting never seems quite right but i m gonna let that one slide as a man who has always called for more sex and drugs in films i can hardly complain about their presence here there people are living life to the fullest and are certainly not being weighed down by bourgeois conventions all that said this film still fully deserves the big no vote that i am going to give it as the most nihilistic person i know i am surprised to report that this one really seemed lost any image they could flash on the screen that would appeal to the wannabes in the audience was used the n and f words are used to comedic proportions their palaces that represent their gluttony are turned into war zones and destroyed for no good reason and then on top of it all we have to listen to the characters wax philosophical on how leading this life somehow places them on a higher plain than the rest of us sorry man but just because you sell drugs instead of stocks doesn t make you any less slimy than those wall street hacks you re still a businessman this film is not worth watching any social point that is made is made accidentally and any filmmaking skills the director may have are lost under his love fest for all things gangsta
1,pefect addition to any little mermaid collection very durable plastic not too many little pieces clothes for dolls could be easier to take on off
0,i didn t use this particular product but the version that came with my computer which was slow but not the end of the world the problem i had with them is that they aoutomatically renew your subscription without giving any warning that they are going to do it i had a year subscription and they send me an e mail years later saying they charged my account with never telling me that i was in auto enrollment when i called to complain they of course had someone who couldn t inderstand me and i had to spell my e mail address three times and was told it would take days for the refund to be processed which is crap because i work for an online store and its easier to void a sale and cheaper for the vendor to do a refund the same day i asked for a manager twice the second time they came back they had the nerve to ask me if i was interested in an upgrade and subscribing to their magazine and was put on the never ending hold until i gave up minutes later which was probably the plan all along so i called my bank and put a stop payment on the automatic payment now i am searching for another protection program and calling their customer service before my purchase to see how it goes
1,this is the third potty i ve purchased for my son the first one was made by parents and it tipped over the first time my son sat on it the second was first years elmo in and the cup pinched his behind in places leaving cuts this one is great although my son was hesitant to go on it at first which i attribute to his experience with the elmo potty he fits nicely on it the other potties were too narrow from front to back and i had to adjust him several times to get him situtated so that he could use the front guard the seat lifts out as the cup which lends itself to not pinching his bottom and easy clean up it s low enough to the ground that his legs fit too the back and arm supports fit well also it s a solid construction and good buy
1,tastes better than most candy bars and has no refined sugar or artificial ingredients
0,all in all i was really dissapointed i really enjoyed the king geedorah album i thought the king geedorah album boasted stellar thematic production tolerable skits and street wise but deep lyrical content doom is on the boards for about of the tracks on escape all have the stereotypical doom sound with the only standout being the x ray produced tracks are minimal but generally sound stiff lacking much of a groove thin synth lines few sampled melodies i did like warning kong which has a nice minimal dark groove the lyrical flows have a classic new york sound pretty good lyrical content is pretty bad unless you enjoy repetitious rhymes about smoking weed and women riding my d
0,i purchased this item because of a recommendation from a friend i will start out by saying that when i first purchased this frame i loved it the display contrast and brightness were great however after short months the display s pixels started acting funny they get out of sync and display a solid color rather than the imgage turning the frame off and back on resolves the issue for about seconds and then it s back to bad pixels myself and two of my friends each purchased this frame and are all experiencing the same issue in conclusion it would have been a great frame if it had worked long enough to display pictures from all four seasons
1,well of course it s that hokey romantic type and of course you see the ending coming from a mile away of course we ve seen it all before but as far as entertainment value goes it s got it reese witherspoon proves once again that she can flesh out an otherwise empty character and give it some personality there s really not much to the characters in this movie but there doesn t need to be i was a little wary of the jon heder character having just come off the great napolean dynamite buzz but i found his character interesting and didn t think he had nearly enough time to flesh it out but he did a good job with what he had you don t have to bust your brain trying to figure out this one but it works when you re in the mood for a straightforward romance it is what it is
1,i see that linda has already laid down the exact same review for all the colors and all the nibs of this pen so there s not much new i can tell you other than to confirm what she wrote and to add a few new details this is an excellent introduction to fountain pens for those with hesitancy about buying one i ve collected a few vintage and new fountain pens over the years some of them lay in a display box loved but unused on contrast you will use this pen it s incredibly cheap for the quality so you get a basically positive experience smooth flowing liquid expression without the price or the ultimate cost losing the darn thing at prices ranging from to and beyond amazon com sells a namiki fountain pen for well over the habitual loser of inanimate objects would be understandably reluctant to invest in a gold nibbed laquered objet d art and would opt instead for this beautiful cheaply that even calls itself disposable it s a personal preference but i d opt for the fine nib over the medium if you re going to use this everyday you ll write faster and use less ink the medium is nice for big john hancock ish signatures and weighty thoughts but you lose a little expression those personal shadings and slight angles that even the untrained can t help but produce the steel nib writes surprisingly smoothly and as mentioned above the ink doesn t evaporate too quickly you can t refill the pen it s disposable just because of that but you can buy several in different colors and nib sizes and get some idea of what kind of pen suits you if and when you feel like you want to purchase a re fillable fountain pen try for something under levenger com s excellent true writer and the retro brand pens sell for about this much although those liquidy smooth gel pens have taken some over some of the non ballpoint market the mechanically minded will enjoy the physics of bottle filling a pen others will simpy dig the tradition of using a pen with a rich history when it comes to fountain pens the p is for panache
0,i bought this phone for the great features and because i ve had good luck with other motorola products the phones and answering machine are easy to set up but that is about the only redeeming quality that they have the handsets frequently lose connection with the base unit the only way to get them working again is to unplug and then replug the power to the base unit which loses the answering machine settings range on the handsets is only mediocre i can t talk in the far corners of the house even with the base centrally located also battery life is very limited overall the phones are very disappointing and i would definitely recommend not buying them
1,for the price this is a great buy colors are good has a nice weight to it would buy more from this merchant
0,the amazon ad said next day shipping took over a month for the first magazine to arrive do not buy this from amazo

0,the player stopped working after only a few months it would accept dvds but not play them and refuse to eject them that behavior started out as intermittent but it finally gave up the ghost and swallowed a dvd and never let go we had to take the player apart just to get the dvd out before throwing the player away in the trash our previous dvd player lasted over years before it started skipping this one lasted less than a year before it stopped working altogether what a waste save your time and money and buy another machine
1,i had read about evacuators on a few forums it works as described no complaints other than the amount of time it took do draw quarts that said perhaps the first use included a bit of a learning curve the fill drain capability looked appealing but if you don t need to use this device to fill fluids i would opt for the drain only device less moving parts fewer things can fail
1,maybe i m bias because i really like yamaha maybe because i have kinda good ears or it s the fat check sitting on my table from yamaha but what ever it is i realllllllly like this sub woofer i looked around a long time for the right sub and i like to think i got a good one here you want power ok it s only watts not watts like velodyne but in my room by with a foot ceiling it rocks i love music all kinds loud or quiet no matter i like both but i do like depth more than volume however i believe if you are going to listen to something real loud being able to feel the music is as important as being able to here it and let me say you can feel music if you want to one of the things i love most about this sub is it s range it can maybe reach hertz hertz that is astounding is the lowest frequency the human ear can hear in fact it s starting into the range of sounds that are felt more than heard maybe i have good ears and maybe i don t but to hear rich airy low end and bass notes yes bass notes bass is not one big boomy lump of noise it s huge open grazing pasture of distinct sounds in short music sounds great even hip hop which i don t like sounds well better also their is no need to turn the volume way up to hear a improvement at very quiet levels too you can hear good clean bass notes but if you do a lot of quite listening we re talking back ground music levels disable the auto on feature and manually turn it on and off because if you happen to be listening to something quiet even if you still can here low notes from this it does not seem to be enough signal to keep the auto on well on it improves movies as well take something with a lot of dynamics like the hitchhiker s guide to the galaxy or sky captain and the world of tomorrow there are a lot of sudden loud and very low sounds in those movie s and the yamaha handles it all with aplomb with most of the controls are on the front set up is and tweaking is made easy and if you are wondering about the bass button if the button is in the music position you will have to turn the volume to a higher level to shake the termites out of the walls than if its set to the movie position i think music is a flatter frequency response as this review seems to be getting a bit long i ll some it up yes there are far better subwoofers out there like from b w but i don t have the money for those and if someone gave me a watt velodyne i would take it in a heartbeat but i wouldn t want to give this one up too it s a absolute pleasure to listen to update i have run some test tones on this subwoofer and well it can not reach seems to be the limit for usable bass although it is still audible to around is a stretch if sounds to high their are not many movie s or cd s that have any sounds below and very very few have sound below although it does not go as low as i would have hoped it is still a good sub for the money and still worth a five star review
0,i bought this for my daughter when she was year old i could barely zip it around b c it is so small i keep checking the tags to make sure i got the right size and not the infant one i looked at some other reviews and saw many people were having the same problem it s a great product for smaller children
0,when we first bought our baby s mattress it did not have any unusual odors at all we washed the ultimate mattress pad before using it but after a short time we began to smell an odor on the mattress that became stronger with time we finally replaced the mattress and once again had a mattress that was stench free by this time we had purchased an organic mattress pad as well use of the organic did not cause any problem but since we had not yet put two and two together not smart we put the ultimate mattress pad on our new mattress just one time and sure enough it began to smell we now use only organic mattress pads and only one side of the mattress the side that never came in contact with the ultimate mattress pad smells just fine but the side that we did use it on has a stench you don t want your baby sleeping on i guess you need to make sure you put a sheet between the mattress pad and the crib we actually put the sheet over the mattress pad because the surface seemed so rough that we didn t want our little boy sleeping directly on it when we did try that he woke up with a mesh imprinted face
1,i bought this net to accompany a kettler basket i recently bought for my bicycle and it fits perfectly it was as if they were made for eachother i can either wrap it around my basket or hook it onto my rear rack hooks and a directional bias make it immensely practical
0,though these are the songs that make the mills brothers famous they are not the original recordings that made these songs famous and not necessarily sung by the same men that sang the originals certainly they are considerably older these are ok but they lack the punch and familiarity to a fan like myself of the originals the title though not actually misleading leads one to believe you will be listening to the original songs they are not i recommend only if you must have the complete set of mills brothers records
0,don t let the size of the box fool you even though this item comes packaged in a good sized box this product is barely one inch by two inches it s just a small piece of plastic with some type of pheromone embedded in it although it does seem to attract flies for a few days it doesn t seem to last for very long at all it s just a tiny piece of flimsy plastic in my opinion it s just not worth it
0,i agree that the water holder is a bit tedious to fill and measure acurately i always follow the measuring instructions but sometimes the bottle is too cool or too hot even though i have been practicing to get it right i wish it were more accurate and for someone like me who only has a room apartment the cooling feature is not that useful
1,you know it s been quite some time since i ve found myself glued to a videogame where in my mind hours become seconds i say to myself that i m only going to play for a few minutes fifteen tops next thing you know three hours have gone by the last game to do that to me was gta san andreas i thought there would never be another game that would hook me like that i was wrong boy was i ever wrong the godfather for is an addicting and gripping game that throws you into the world of the mafia and links you to the classic storyline found in the film you play an older son with a score to settle your father was wiped out by don barzini right in front of you when you were little don corleone tells you that when you re old enough you will take your revenge now all grown up you aim to serve your godfather and move up the ranks from an outsider to becoming a made man and then some if you re clever enough you might even become don if you re ruthless enough to wipe out all of your enemies you can become the don of ny the decision is up to you the game gives you the classic storyline that we all love and know from the movie only it involves you the missions will be very familiar to the famous scenes we have seen over and over again not only that but in gta fashion you are given a lot of freedom to do things on your own you can shake down rival businesses using various negotiation tactics need some extra cash rob a bank better yet hijack a rival truck and steal the goodies inside you re given a giant world to interact with whether you decide to play the missions straight through or do some freelancing many opportunities to enjoy the game are to be had the graphics are pretty impressive players who are familiar with the gta games will have an easier time getting used to the controls and the various camera angles the look and feel are very identical if you want my honest opinion i actually enjoy this game a lot more than any of the gta games but that s because i m such a fan of the movie it s great that you get to relive your favorite scenes and be a part of the action cons the missions can be tricky and sometimes even downright frustrating a good majority of them are timed so it may take you a few times to get a mission done just right i understand the timer in some missions but sometimes they get a little ridiculous and i feel that they re just trying to throw some unneeded obsticles in your path the good news is that there are tons of checkpoints for each mission so if you fail or die you will not have to start all over again also the game can be glitchy at times now i haven t seen anything major that disrupts my playing at all but i ve heard some people with earlier copies that had some major problems so be careful about that i could go on and on about this game but i m sure it s all been said before you want my verdict i love this game and think it s a blast to play the godfather is bound to be a classic if you re a fan of the movie or the gta games then give it a shot i have beat the game twice already and i still find myself playing it all over again more and more if you have no free time whatsoever then stay away this game will consume you whether you like it or not you have been warned the offer has been made don t you dare try to refuse it if you know what s good for you michael cran
1,this is a great magazine with the exception of articles written by herb glossberger who seems to only write articles about the people at la lifting club where he works out if you overlook that aspect the mag is great the knowledge that can be gained simply by reading the articles written by louie simmons and dave tate well worth it it also cannot be purchased in your local magazine store

0,please see reviews of the previous version the adobe activation process can cause a lot of continuing problems for legitimate users of this software too bad such good software is hampered by such a process being in the software business i don t mind companies worrying about piracy and taking some measures but this is a bit too much you might need to allow the software to access the internet regularly to keep your activation and not bother you with notices of reactivation but that also means you open it for adobe to do their push marketing into their software i have used adobe products for over years and have always liked them too bad they have lost the customer focus in their rage for software piracy and greed for intrusive marketing

0,where to begin cliched pretentious flat static maudlin melodramatic homophobic and finally just plain boring start with an over the top caricature of a deaf mute patsy cline young drag queen arriving the big city pile on cardboard colorful characters like typical aids patient porno star and loud mouthed latina hot mamna and whaddya get an amateur film populated with some of the most unlikable unattractive characters ever all spewing some of the unbelievably bad dialogue ever written and to think the formerly talented director made the whole wide world also with d onofrio go figure nice cover art though
0,i m sure such a movie would be approached with much hostility if some other group or religion would be the laughing target to imply that christians are typically mean and narrow minded is pure racism this is just as evil as implying that all jews are rich or that all african americans have rhythem what has jesus himself done to warrant such christian bashing out of hollywood the man has suffered enough on the cross leave him alone
1,nintendo ds lite introduction in late nintendo premiered the nintendo dual screen or nintendo ds for short despite the skepticism from many critics and fans alike the new console quickly won audiences over it was nintendo s best handheld console to date and in nintendo released a smaller lighter version of the system appropriately called the ds lite overview nintendo released the ds lite in mid the new version of the system is smaller than the old version features repositioned buttons switches etc variable brightness levels and a few other changes from the classic ds it retails for about and comes in three colors white black and pink review nintendo did a good job revising the ds many problems with the older version of the system are fixed here are some of the highlights and flaws of the new version the good smaller and more compact than the original ds the original ds was rather bulky in comparison to some other handhelds on the market and it was kind of a pain to haul around finally we ve got a smaller lighter version of the system that can easily be transported variable brightness levels you can adjust the brightness to your liking with this version of the ds brighter levels use more battery power lower levels use less so you can plan out how best to use your battery s life features a clip in the game boy advance slot unlike the original ds the lite version includes a clip that goes in the slot where game boy advance games fit this helps to give the system a streamlined appearance and it keeps that slot cleaner compatible with the e reader the old ds due to its shape couldn t use the e reader accessory the lite model s shape is better all around and it can use it available in three cool colors whether you want white black or pink there s a color for everyone repositioned buttons and things nintendo made the system more convenient to use by moving the buttons around to spots that are easier to use redesigned stylus the new stylus is bigger and thicker than the ones with the old ds and is an all around improvement compatible with the older ds since it s basically the same system you won t have any compatibility issues the bad smaller isn t necessarily better in every way i have big hands and they fit the old ds fine shrinking it actually makes it a little harder in some aspects to use all of the buttons still not compatible with pre game boy advance games of course i wasn t really expecting nintendo to fix this still not compatible with game boy advance multiplayer another thing i wasn t expecting fixed overall overall this is a nice improvement over the original ds there are problems but for the most part just the same problems the original had if you haven t gotten a ds yet definitely go for the lite model edition notes the ds lite is relatively new and should be in stores for years to come
0,i bought this for a woman who is a small size eight one of those people who is just a touch too big to wear a size six and normal medium sized clothes usually run very loose not this tiny shirt it looked all right when she opened the package but when she wore it it made the kid look as if she had flub it was inexpensive enough that i won t bother returning it but the item although well made was sized so small as to be useles

1,here s an epic movie that reminded me of those that were made in the mid such as dr zhivago and lawrence of arabia interesting to note that omar sharif was in this modern day movie and dr zhivago several younger friends that saw this film told me they were very disappointed because thanks to the previews they thought it would be an action packed adventure story such as the mummy well it wasn t and it was way too slow for them frankly i thought the slow parts were the best and overall thought the film had just the right amount of action instead of overdoing it as the recent mummy pictures did another big plus was the cinematography this is a beautifully filmed movie stunning in some parts another good point is the language hardly a swear word on the negative side there was the usual political correctness a la dances with wolves in which viewers are reminded several times of the massacre at wounded knee and soldiers are portrayed as the bad guys the horse race had some credibility problems too as hidalgo came back from the dead not once but twice to race like secretariat anyway if you are looking for a modern day adventure story with old fashioned storytelling and no language problems this film is for you and the rest of the family

1,this flashlight is simply awesome if you just have a little common sense this is meant to be an emergency flashlight and if you use it as such it is great this is definately not a spotlight type of light and it isn t meant to be but when you need some light in an emergency a little shaking and you have some light it s starting to dim just shake it some more and voila more light you could be lost miles from anywhere and you know your batteries are not going to go dead on the walk for help i don t know why people are giving this bad reviews this is so easy my year old niece can shake it and get it working and if you are smart enough to shake it like the instructions say the light will last longer then people on here are saying if my year old niece can figure it out i would think that adults could too but there are always going to be people out there who complain about everything this is an emergency no battery shake flashlight i think some people were expecting a flashlight that would shake itself you should keep one of these flashlights in your vehicles campers boats kids rooms etc how many times have you went to get a flashlight and the batteries were dead and you couldn t find new ones this one has worked everytime i have uesd it but then again i do have common sense this flashlight is great

0,i m writing a review for the first time because i ve never been so dissapointed with a shopping experience i bought cell phone cases from world of bags so that i could give them as christmas gifts i ordered them on december it took them until december to confirm that they were being shipped it was as if they were waiting for the last minute to ship me my items amazon has a two week policy for shipment of products needless to say i did not get to give them away as christmas gifts this is the type of service i got for choosing standard shipping which was very expensive to send two little cell phone cases i can t specify how much because they won t let me post prices in reviews they also shipped them seperately a sign of inefficiecy indeed one came in an appropriately sized bubble envelope and the other in a huge box i ve decided to not return the items because i want to cut my losses now and just never order from them again

1,i have been wearing by calvin klein since it was first launched in the year i first arrived in california it seems i am one of those people forever stuck in a time warp and prefer this classic instead of trying new scents while i prefer the eau de parfum spray i have both variations although at first this tends to have a strong aroma this doesn t last after being applied to your skin i love the blend of vanilla mandarin orange peach and lemon that make up the scent of my preference is more of a racy provocative alluring scent instead of brimming like flowers with my skin irritations asthma and allergies i have no problems with spraying my body parts with the color is quite appealing reminding me of spiced rum with the brown amber and gold tones cologne is suitable for both day and evening wear indoors and outdoors and those luscious intimate settings this is definitely a feminine scent sweet sexy and not too fruity or powerful there is a gold toned rim with the cap snapping on and pulling off most of the time with ease sometimes the lid does not go on just right and then the cap part becomes undone and this makes two pieces once the scent has set in for awhile on my skin i detect a hint of floral with wood combination and have read on fragrance net that has oriental spices it really is a winning combination that has captured my interest over the years this is a scent that is recognizable by men and women and can be worn through out the seasons i would not say this is a musk scent but more of a spicy tingle that needs to be only administered once a day for long lasting appeal the appeal of seems to run from girls in their early twenties to those of us in our early forties from conservative ladies to party animals although it is a darker color than most fragrances there is no staining on clothing but i do not wear sweaters whites or turtlenecks when i do use the glass jar i have noticed frequently when standing over the sink the yellowish brown tint left in the sink and have to rinse it off as well as my finger tips is a potent and romantic perfume for evening the prices of the assorted sizes of range from forty to sixty dollars
0,this tool will not take an edge either with a grinder or a file it is very flexible so that the energy of a blow goes into flexing the blade rather than cutting stems which has undesirable consequences for your hand if you are looking for a useful tool keep looking
1,though i have never traveled the world this perfume allows me to feel like a veteran globe trotter it is sophisticated without being obnoxious i genuinely feel like a woman of intrigue and experience though fanciful it is fun for a homegrown rose

0,no it s certainly not as good as the first one but i did enjoy some of demons the beginning is cool enough with the demon s resurrection and it s gaining access into sally s apartment via the tv set the tension and dread seem to build quite nicely that is right up to the scene where the kid demon s chest pops open to reveal an idiotic rubber demon puppet ugg it reminded me of those stupid monsters in ghoulies hobgoblin or some other wretched mess the apartment building setting was interesting but seemed to be mostly wasted on the few precious bursts of action we actually get i did like the weightlifter folks in the gym they were hilarious and at least they put up a fight against the infernal invaders the battle in the parking garage was ok too maybe i just expected to be a bit more frightening and disturbing
0,i ve previously had subscription cell phone services with a variety of providers but found i rarely used the number of minutes i was paying for a prepaid phone service seemed like the way to go and sti mobile sounded like a good alternative because the price was competitive and minutes don t expire i signed up and shortly after received my samsung phone it arrived however defective the port for recharging the phone was damaged per the sti mobile web site i contacted them within days to arrange for a replacement phone this resulted in a number of email exchanges with customer service in the first one the rep told me that i was mistaken and must have been sent the wrong charger no offer was made to replace the charger strangely which was included as part of the package deal after additional emails where i reassured her that i did in fact have the right charger i took the phone in to a local merchant who showed me the charger i was shipped worked with an identical model phone it was the port on the shipped phone that was defective at this point the rep apologized and told me i would have to contact samsung for a replacement phone this entire process took several weeks in short i guess you get what you pay for if i had been shipped a working phone sti mobile probably would have met my needs but i was turned off by the poor customer service and have since found another prepaid phone provider

0,tony kushner s liner notes are a chilling foretaste of his jew hatred soaked script for the film munich a paragon of self regard he sneers at the historicity and compelling morality of the jewish people s attachment through the millenia to its eternal homeland rather kushner makes a point of elevating the moral stature of the islamofascists who have unhesitatingly and unceasingly for a century prosecuted a campaign of genocidal slaughter against any and all jews who sought to reclaim their stolen patrimony through aboveboard land purchase and settlement prior to wars of justifiable self defense like his evil arab idols kushner cannot abide the concept of a restored jewish commonwealth secured on a foundation of existential legitimacy political independence and territorial sovereignty zionism and its morally necessary outcome the state of israel enabled and is continuing to enable the very effloresence of jewish culture in the us in the post and certainly post vineyards where the klezmatics have been frolicking and where kushner has gained his fame and fortune but kushner hates the very thought of being liberated and seeks to sow that hatred throughout world jewry the klezmatics should feel ashamed for linking themselves to this cruel purveyor of assisted suicide
1,i love this perfume it has been my signature everyday scent for several years now alot of people ask what you are wearing because it smells so good and guys love it too
1,when i first came to iran black clad women all seemed the same scary unsmiling servants of the ayatollas having visited the islamic republic of iran in june i was better prepared for that vast country portrayed by elaine sciolino in her book persian mirrors i am more than grateful for this book which alerted me to the diversity of cultures and the general way of life so absolutely different from the western world elaine sciolino made me so very aware of the perfect social world of the iranians and also i am thrilled to say that once you make a friend of an iranian you have a friend for life my most treasured memories of iran will never leave me and i thank ms sciolino for preparing me for that journey reviewed by heather marshall negahdar sugar cane
1,i watched out of episodes in two days it may be educational for people who didn t know much about it but if you are somewhat familiar with the topics this documentary film didn t offer much more
1,the quality of the product is great and was just as advertised the delivery time was excellent as it was promised for a week delivery but arrived the next day great company to do business with
0,i was very disappointed when i received this to see that it was simply a package of two cables cables that you can pick up at radio shack for much cheaper just ridiculous the airport express itself is fantastic but skip this accessory and go to your local radio shack for the mini rca cable and a quick search online for the optical to mini

1,i ve tried several shampoo bars and had finally given up hope that i could ever use them they had always left my hair feeling gross and gummy no matter how much i rinsed or tried vinegar water mix rinses after as was suggested but this one had had some good reviews so i gave it a go it was awesome it lathered rather well and rinsed out very easily i used it in conjunction with the american cream conditioner and my hair s very very silky and soft right now it had gotten very course over the period of a week with using avalon organics shampoo and conditioner i m excited now that i ve finally found a shampoo bar that works i can finally say goodbye to bulky shampoo bottles and same some space

0,do not waste your time or money see the original once in awhile a remake of a movie from another culture works for example seven samurai becomes magnificant seven most of the time the remake is trash the original la femme nikita is a great movie exciting with a strong political viewpoint this version is simply hollywood pablum

0,i was disappointed that the cup holders come off too easy they button onto the car seat and it isn t strong enough so when my boys try to stuff their juice or water in them they snap right back off the are no longer attached to the seats because i refuse to keep putting them back on i guess this seat is okay it is nice and plush but the downside to getting a backless seat which i didn t think about before i purchased this was the fact that the kids can t fall asleep in these seats my kids like i am sure most kids are when they go for a drive the motion knocks them right out but because there is nothing to support their head and neck they slump over and are very uncomfortable so they usually don t fall asleep unless they are just really beat and then i worry because i don t want them to get a crook in their neck i can say that this seat is very lightweight which is a big change coming from the regular child seat
1,this game while simple in it s storyline shows us the depth and power of disney matched with square enix first square and enix merge effectively bringing together the makers of two of the largest rpg s of all time dragon quest and final fantasy now we have the perfect pairing of wit humor heart and pure square story based in many of the worlds from disney legends your character sora is a superb study in dynamic role playing the chains you can get going in sora s attacks are amazing the extra battles in the sky over london and in the hercules arena are outstanding to learn this battle style you must have wits of steel and thumbs of orchaleum the battle against sephiroth one of the best known villians from the final fantasy series is awesome i never did beat sephiroth but the battle was intense and i had him beaten to his knees several times the bottom line is the sequel will be amazing as it revisits many of the same worlds and reinvents itself this game essentially creates a new genre blending a soulful cast with characters from disney lore the underpinning story is not to be missed be sure you get the extended ending by following the brady games guide the summons are a bit hard to leverage but tinker bell comes in handy in some of the tougher battles degree rotating battles with the shadow king in the sky above london and the final villian will thrill and captivate audiences of all ages the secrets hidden in the game are rightly difficult to find and awe inspiring in their execution
0,this is a great album and a great artist with albert king theres no going wrong when you buy one of his albums he is the king of electric blues you can hear all these songs in great format just awsome playing awsome singing its sure no wonder srv and hendrix really loved albert king

1,my wife and i both love this in our opinion the thicker plastic tines offer a more comfortable and pleasurable head trip than the trippers one might find in the mall the vibrations make it better than the non vibrating head trippers but are not overwhelming another benefit of this particular device is that it is able to be completely disassembled and packed to be taken with you on travelsor on vacations it s a pretty simple device sold at a reasonable cost and in my opinion is a better implementation than the metal ones
0,poor quality unit worked sometimes sometimes not gave up and returned it after a couple of weeks of trying it out
1,this is a great phone that i ve used for a year now i d like to highlight the standout features that make this phone unique especially at its price player just get an adapter for the usb port a few bucks on ebay and you can plug in your stereo headphones too bad they haven t offered an update to the motorola digital audio player microsd slot you can take a microsd card put it into the included adapter and plug into an sd slot on your computer and copy you can take any and make it your ringtone cropping it will make it more effective videos animation looks great but the sound was slightly out of sync search the web for video converters to convert your content or pictures i love making my own ringtones and not having to buy them bluetooth i got an explorer headset for and it works great with it battery easily exchangeable easily slide off the cover and pop in a fresh one the battery life isn t very long so it s good to have a spare battery they re cheap video camera not high quality video but its something the old razr couldn t do customization i love customization you can set up the hotkey on the side of the phone the two on the top of the keypad and the directional pad to go directly to most functions of the phone it even has a shortcut list to list all your favorite features you can easily make any picture including pics you take into your wallpaper also you can find replacement faceplates to make your phone unique speakerphone works even when closed good for using automated phone menu systems and when you re put on hold the speaker is loud and great for ringtones and the plastic may resonate at certain sounds though vibrating alert vibe then ring why doesn t every phone have this it should be the default standard for all phones the vibration is definitely strong enough to feel in a pocket if you are one to show off your ringtone let it move onto ring otherwise be descreet and answer immediately as for what i don t like i don t care much for the motorola menu style i prefer sanyo and samsung interfaces the menu is the same as a razr or slvr all the lettering on the outside as well as some case paint has rubbed off i carry my phone in my pocket so the phone has aged a bit i scraped off the remainder of the lettering so it wouldn t look half worn off all the great features is what keeps me from getting a samsung or other more expensive phones this phone just has all the fee free features you could want
1,good low sodium low sugar granola that i feel i can t afford at the onesie price in the traditional shopping venues
1,wrathchild alone is worth the purchase of this album its just that darn good of a song but hey the whole album is good the title track is brutally awesome especially live on the beast over hammersmith cd iron maiden box set and murders in the rue morgue is another classic then there is drifter and the two intrumentals the ides of march and ghengis khan who papa roach would rip off the guitar riff from for their one hit wonder song last resort maybe not as good as their debut album but still a masterpeice of an album
0,i purchased of them put in new alkaline batteries and found that it will not cut hair as advertised the motor is underpowered useless product
0,this isn t what i thought it would be the instructions are unclear so i had to refer to the box to guess at how to install it i finally figured it out after about minutes of fiddling with it you have push down on the top to get more than a tiny bit of gel out so it takes two hands that means that once you put gel on your face you get gel on the machine i set mine machine to the hottest setting for it to feel warm this must be a safety thing but i can t imagine what the lower settings are for the gel cools extremely fast so by the time you apply it to your face only the gel where you first apply it feels warm i had the same machine for foam and that worked a lot better but i don t use foam shaving creme anymore once i use up this can of gel the hot gel machine gets retired
0,first of all i would like to mention that the invicta brand that exists and produces watches nowadays has nothing to do with the swiss company that bears the same name but went into bankruptcy a few decades ago the actual invicta company is an american one and has bought the rights to use this name the mechanisms are swiss made or made in japan about the ones made in switzerland i cannot post an opinion this particular model which i purchased this year has a japanese mechanism made by myota i think every hours it loses some precious seconds so after a few days it becomes a matter of minutes in conclusion it has a problem with precision beeing unable to keep time with accuracy i would advise anyone who wants to buy this watch to think twice of course the discount price is attractive but the watch doesn t meet it s expectasions i consider that a minimum dose of accuracy is required the only good aspect about this watch is it s appearance learn from other s mistakes
1,this is not only a nice tinkerbell accessory for the car but a quality steering wheel cover also the material appears as if it should hold up nicely and the graphics are nice
0,if you are sensitive to smells do not buy this mat seemed to fill the room with it s funk does not grip well i bought it for grip yes it s stable worth it not to me try the hugger mugger earth elements mat model it s got great grip and seems like a feather weight compared to this mat not as stable in place but seems a better value reasonable price and it s biodegradable
0,i owned this camera for almost two years before someone stole it from me and i said thank you because i hated the thing i used to have a samsung and it was better than this one the worst problem slow slow slow slow if you use the flash be prepared to wait seconds before being able to take the next picture it s worse at low battery strength but even with fresh batteries it was tedious the other thing that disappointed me was the color the light from the flash is glaring and unnatural and without the flash everything is reddish grainy and blurry i never found a decent middle ground i take a lot of pictures indoors and at low light and my samsung wasn t great but it was better than this one when i look at the pictures i ve uploaded on my computer i can see the difference when my old camera died and i got the nikon the worst thing about owning this camera was occasionally borrowing someone else s camera and wishing i owned that one do some research before you make a mistake like i did i ve heard similar things from others who owned the same camera
1,the recipes in this book are often somewhat complex but they are easy to follow and the results are wonderful braising does not aways take a long time either one of my favorites is soy braised chicken thighs with star anise and orange peel minutes total
1,if you like the typical teenage comedy then you should give this movie a try it does fall for some of the routine story lines that are in every movie like this but it is still a funny movie the best part is probably when they visit tom green s grandparents i never can get over the dog that talks lol overall like i said if you like teen comedies then you will like this movie avoid it if you don
1,this is the type of music to sit down relax put on a pair of headphones and let it absorb your concious from spacey sounding electronics to soft vocals over piano to heart pounding rhythms to skittering percussion this is just a taste of what is supersilent and from what i hear it is all improvised which blows my head clean off all this coming from someone who has never heard them before talk about a great buy highly highly recommended i close my eyes to awaken among the cosmos traveling without a tangible body drunk with the infinite beauty i sigh without a mouth and think
0,to be honest when i saw the picture in the description area it looks like an awesome watch but when i opened the package i wanted to return it if you see the picture you can appreciate the digital information like thermometer digital hour day month etc but in the real life you must incline it until you are able to see it the other thing is the thermometer is not so accurate because your body heat affects it when my digital home thermometer marks f the watch marks f so if you want an accurate measure you need to take it off and wait between and to reach an accurate measure this information was extracted from the manual so in conclusion if you want a watch with a thermometer built in just keep looking for other models
0,it seems that other than a song or two fall out boy forgot their guitar s very disappointing and slow paced
0,ok the original is a classic and is what minutes long jackson stretches it out to hours and adds very little to the story the native were scary the quiet scenes with kong were welcome additions they actually made him into a character something that can t be said for any of the human characters the insect scenes are ridiculous the dinosaur stampede was idiotic anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie now jackson is adding munutes to a movie that is grossly over padded to begin with peter jackson is a hack director that has no idea how to tell a story efficiently remind me to skip his next hour long epics
0,they re pretty but flimsy very light construction the lens is not really mirrored so if you attempting to hide your eyes forget it it would be better to spend some real money and get a more professional pair than a cheap chinese knock off gave them two stars simply because they are good looking but cheap and they feel that way on your face
1,this razor rocks the proper technique is easy to learn short light strokes down then up if you want a closer shave this gives me hardly any nicks compared to the gillette mach and is way easier to unclog than the shick quattro the sample blade continues to last with about shaves a week since dec typical razor cartridges wouldn t even come close to that longevity and they cost about times as much as the replacement merkur blades which are cents each i am just doing facial shaving with it at this point hopefully it will fare just as well with head shaving i expect i ll be using merkur for the rest of my life
1,i bought this brio train set for my year old niece over christmas and she absolutely loves it it s a great starter set and can be expanded with other brio track sets very easy to put together and the pieces are durable makes a great gift
0,i never cared much for the soundtrack aside from a few tracks this film was wack the acting directing but the story line was cool in fact if someone knew how to put this together with a stronger cast this film would have been interesting this film flip flopped time periods it hurt it s cause i will give prince props though for being a black film director back at a time when it was really rare truth be told in it ain t that much better on a whole
1,love it the questions are great the party mode is great entertainment
0,i have gone through of these straighteners i know you think i would have learned however my first one was lost my second one stopped working in a matter of months and the third one stop working in less than a month i purchased the third one despite what happened with the second one i had bought because it was an affordable price i liked the size and when the second one i had did work it worked well unfortunately in a matter of a few weeks one of the plates burned out so only one side works causing obvious problems i would recommend the sedu it has gotten great reviews and is more expensive but i think when it comes to straighteners you get what you pay for
0,i would not reccommend this product i would rather do chinese arithmetic than put this together again it took a long time and i am good at this type of thing the unit is ok but not as good as it looks hope this was helpfu

0,i m not a big fan of communism nor of stalin but i cross checked the facts mentioned in this book with facts in some other books i have read on similar subject and found that author edvard radzinsky is strongly biased against stalin in the entire book he seems to give no credit for anything to stalin nor to his leadership qualities during the course of second world war dont waste your money on a propaganda book better to go for an unbiased account from a neutral observer thats what biographies are supposed to be
1,for the price is a good deal i only use one card i have the other one for backup nice product good pric
1,the good it has fairly good graphics the franchise is very real and you can play it up to seasons it has a bunch of new features that madden didn t like the truck stick and nfl superstar the bad once you ve played this for awhile you ll realize that john madden and al micheals say the same thing every game it get old when you look into the crowd in a game the graphics suck it looks like a big blob of colors overall it is a really fun game i hope madden will be better though
1,that nigga s crazy and bicentennial nigger both surpass this album in laughs but it would still rank high if it wasn t for the poor sound quality there s a few audience members who can be heard a lot more clearly than pryor himself half the time but some great classic bits and believe me you re never bored

1,the new nikon en battery is a slight update for the nikon en provided with earlier dslr models such as the it adds a contact that allows new cameras to determine how much charge is left in the battery the battery is grey to distinguish it from the black en the en is backwards compatible with the en you can put it in your or the reverse is not true the number of pictures that the battery gives you depends on a lot of factors including shooting style lcd usage and of course camera the lcd on the will use up the battery much quicker than the smaller it is sufficient for a day of shooting unless you are using a in some professional capacity in which case you ll probably be investing in at least one backup battery

0,read some reviews that say my cousin lost pounds by drinking this water and walking a mile a day and ask yourself wouldn t that guy have lost the exact same weight drinking that much tap water and walking a mile a day this water is simply an attempt to fool gullible consumers into paying money for something with absolutely no value if you won t drink water and exercise unless you have special water imbued with mythical powers than by all means this is the product for you but if you prefer to save your money simply exercise eat healthier and drink regular tap water

1,after years i have decided to give up on the great dramatic movies that present the world in all its massive turmoil i get all that from newspapers periodicals radio televisiopn and now even the inernet i want to watch movies that i call feel good movies these movies cemnter on a small group of people with a few insignificant problems and then over the course of an hour or so workout the kinks of thier lives and live happily ever after these movies can be full of pathos or bathos or even slap stick comdedy but they never present you with any problem greater than how to get your mother in law to babysit the kids but not move in with you unless you want her to cold comfort farm meets my criteria to be classifid as a feel good movie

1,a film that centers on four friends who made a pact to leave their small town arrive at zero hour and must decide if they will go through with it the story is simple enough and not a whole lot happens but there s no denying it this movie is enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing in every way it s a treat to see an intelligent movie where the main charachters are teenagers and that the film doesn t have to resort too fart jokes for an audience not one charachter is stereotyped they are human and they ll probably remind you of people you know i applaud this kind of a movie and i wish there would be more of them

0,susanna rowson s charlotte temple is not the first novel and certainly not the last to deal with the topic of the morally fallen woman poor pitiful charlotte finds herself in the midst of an immoral and unforgiving world where one transgression sends her on the road to permanent ruin rowson encases her heroine charlotte temple within a world of virtue and vengeance charlotte has no possible means of escaping her inevitable fate because the author narrator makes it clear from the onset that she has written this story as a lesson to young woman she has no real interest in charlotte as a dimensional character charlotte simply serves as a symbol of lost virtue and symbols do not have real emotions or feelings charlotte temple was written in and became one of the first best sellers of the newly formed america a morally abhorrent woman who pays for her sins almost always guaranteed a best seller in the eighteenth century and now charlotte temple has been rediscovered and published in a scholarly press edition was this reclamation of charlotte really necessary in the past twenty years feminist scholars have rediscovered authors and texts that have gone out of print or been totally ignored by the literati authors such as anne plumptre frances burney aphra behn sarah fielding and charlotte lennox have been dusted off and given new literary lives feminist scholar cathy davidson has taken charlotte temple in hand and aims to join rowson to the above list of rediscoveries unfortunately rowson does not warrant such treatment rowson has a flat humorless approach to the fallen woman story unlike burney s evelina or camilla rowson does not imbue her narrative with needed levity her pedantic iron fisted preaching smothers the modern reader in a moral morass that confounds rather than illuminates in many of the fallen women stories authors would use the genre as a subversive technique to criticize the patriarchal structures rowson does engage in such subversion within the novel she seeks to preach to the young women who may fall victim to the unscrupulous man in england and america it was not considered altogether lady like to read a novel so rowson would be preaching to young women who had already transgressed rowson does not criticize men within the novel she does not censure montraville for taking charlotte as his mistress impregnating her and abandoning her for a wealthier woman when he believes that charlotte has becomes his best friend s mistress he does not believe that she would soil her reputation even though she has ruined her life by engaging in an illicit affair with him he aims to enact revenge upon the friend for acting dishonorable against her yet if he had not acted dishonorably towards her she would not have been reduced to a penniless pregnant ex mistress scrounging the streets for food and shelter he never takes responsibility for his role in charlotte s downfall rowson had the perfect opportunity for savage criticism of the patriarchy with montraville but she fails to take it instead rowson places the blame for charlotte s ruin on the women within the novel when charlotte leaves the safe bosom of her morally upstanding family she enters into the deviant world of the female who fail to protect her from licentious men madame du pont errs in judgment by hiring the morally loose miss la rue madame du pont sets charlotte s downfall in action rowson does not punish the ignorant madame du pont by killing her she ends up an hysterical mess after the montraville charlotte elopement miss la rue the woman who pushes charlotte into the arms of montraville must be punished for being a promiscuous woman she ends up poor and begs for her last scrap of food she ends up dying painfully as rowson takes the opportunity to lecture her readers on the improper behavior of loose women why would modern readers want to read this i do not think any intelligent would reader would want to subject themselves to the depressing experience of reading this novel at pages it seemed to progress at such an excruciating pace no character has any shadings there are no subplots to divert the attention from the static charlotte rowson does nothing to keep our interest unfortunately rowson has become a heroine to feminist scholars for her feat as the first american woman to have a best selling novel that accomplishment is noteworthy as literary trivia but it does not make for engaging reading
1,it is truly a pity that the western has died off they are rare and far between these days a few years back tom selleck and sam elliot made a few together and separate they are all worth seeing this one has tom playing cable a confederate soldier who has left the war early because he knows it is over and the south has lost it just hasn t been declared yet his family and friends thought him to be dead and the reunion seems a bit shaky his wife played by suzy amis is a tough as nails no nonsense frontier woman that knows guns well from her fathers gunsmithing business eventually she works things out with her husband cable and it is a good thing he has her to back him since she is great with a gun even though cable believes the war is over he finds sympathizers trying to enlist his aid in the confederate cause but he shuns them when he is accused of murdering a retired union officer he must track down the real murderer and bring him to justice the production values are excellent and the acting directing sets and music are all top drawer good dvd quality but no extras if you enjoy westerns you should find it very entertaining if you like it be sure to see crossfire trail and conagher

0,my son is months old now and for the first months the monitor worked pretty well we got a bit of static from time to time but i would have given it stars but one night i woke up to reassure myself with the little green on light and saw that the monitor was not on thinking it was a fluke i turned it back on checked the baby and went to bed but over the course of a couple of weeks it became more and more unreliable turning off at will it was also hard to turn it back on i had to flip the switch several times before it would work and this is not a battery issue since it was plugged in the entire time i went to the evenflo website and read the faqs there s a mention of a problem with the power light going out but nothing about the monitor itself going out needless to say we ve thrown it away and have gotten a different brand i mentioned this to my friend with an month old the other day and she said the same exact thing happened to hers just stopped working reliably she s bought a different monitor too both of our new monitors are working perfectly now with less static i wouldn t recommend purchasing this monitor until they make some changes

0,having been a casual fan of stax records for a few years i decided earlier this year that i should go all out and splurge on this cd box set big mistake i have many many complaints about this set but what it basically boils down to is that this whole set is an absolute mess it misses many key b sides such as otis redding s hard to handle and booker t the mg s tic tac toe and doesn t even include every a side the label released despite the title of the compilation where are the sides that hoyt johnson released for the label the linear notes by steve greenberg the man who gave us that phony soul queen joss stone and the headache inducing baha men are horrible mostly focusing on his personal opions of the artists and or songs rather than the stories behind them and within the sections for each disc in the booklet they entries aren t actually arranged in any particular order least of all the order of the tracks on the cds that would make too much sense and there should ve been more photos too add to this the set s main problem the music the fact is that most of the songs on here are really lame seriously why did you buy it then i hear you say well the stax songs i was familiar with such as green onions b a b y you don t miss your water sittin on the dock of the bay soul man born under a bad sign etc are all great songs well why don t you like this set then you re thinking answer because the or so great songs on here are sandwiched between over filler songs over discs if you think i m being harsh on these songs i m not i can appreciate songs like wendy rene s bar b q and the memphis nomad s don t pass your judgement but aside from a few good numbers and a few pleasent but dull numbers most of the non hits on here are pretty bad basically if you really like a stax artist then go and buy a best of for that artist if your looking for a sampler of stax s best songs then go and buy the cd stax story don t bother with this one
1,pupsqueak is wonderful i am a picky mother about toys i hate toys that are too loud too commercial too cheesy too useless i have high standards but pupsqueak gets my picky mom seal of approval wholeheartedly here s why i am very blessed to have a mother who loves to send my children lots of goodies while it s easy to know what to send a year old with distinct likes and interests it can be harder to gauge what a twelve week old baby will enjoy we have no shortage of toys and gadgets to entertain our new daughter with and she clearly enjoys some of them kicking legs cooing waving arms etc the pupsqueak however took it to a different level she loves this thing we showed it to her around weeks old and she immediately reacted she laughed she kicked all the signs then she reached for the little black and white patterned bone that hangs down we were so excited and she s had it attached to the bar on her carseat ever since the real test however was our hour drive from louisiana to kentucky for the thanksgiving holidays but pupsqueak came through for us with flying colors anytime she would get fussy i could reach back and shake him a bit so he would jingle softly and she would be happy again after my arm would get tired i d make sure he was adjusted where she could get at him and she would at not yet months bat at it herself pupsqueak is a wonderful toy with a soft gently jingle for young babies and a funny bark that even makes my four year old laugh for older babies he is definitely top dog in my book
1,i bought this title because the first typing instructor for kids got such good reviews i was looking for a way to teach my son keyboarding he has always had a terrible time with handwriting i knew i needed really easy slow paced typing instruction for him or he wouldn t get it well it s months later and he can now type we did it with nothing but this software i made him practice about min day days week all in all he found it to be work to learn this new skill but still rather enjoyable there are games included and several of them are very good meaning they are really fun and build typing skills at the same time there is also a series of drills lessons and typing tests to teach the keyboard the keyboard is introducted a few keys at a time and then you repeat the related drills lessons tests and games until those keys are learned fairly well i had to require my son to keep repeating each section of the keyboard until he could do it at wpm before letting him go to the next section this is what the software recommends but i had to learn it the hard way at first i let my son go ahead too fast and he ended up getting overwhelmed i ended up having to put a sticker chart on the wall and offering him prizes for getting to wpm on each section i would recommend this software for children from to about the cartoon characters are very juvenile and would probably offend a child any older than that however for any adolescent or adult able to ignore the juvenile cartoons this would be an excellent way to learn to type too i found that my typing skills improved just by occasionally using this software

1,don t get me wrong i m as likely as anyone else looking for a chick flick to watch the latest meg ryan movie with the cute leading man but this movie adds something extra instead of just dishing out the same old blather that most romantic comedies spout girl guy meet girl guy go through some conflict but eventually guy girl get together and live happily ever after this movie actually takes the time to explore what makes a relationship between two people special and unique whether that relationship is between two friends lovers or family members this movie is also great because it expounds upon the huge role that a person s mind plays when it comes to love and sex kate capshaw s character helen is great for audience members who still haven t figured out that women are sexual beings and that it s okay for them to enjoy sex even with a much younger man all the characters remind us that even though we may not have everything figured out you can always learn some new tricks no matter what your age if you re in the mood for mindless entertainment i wouldn t recommend this movie however if you re ready for a touching and romantic but still lighthearted flick this is a good one

1,this book unlike morris s work on hillary is actually worth reading because its perspective and analysis of our president is fascinating though the title is a little tiresome and becomes especially so when morris continues to say throughout the book why because he could the book is a fast page turner i particularly enjoyed morris s portrayal of clinton as one who only came to life around other people if they were happy he was if they were in distress he felt their pain a master of reading people and changing according to their feelings clinton was perfectly suited to becoming a president who ruled by polls enter dick morris as clinton s chief poller he also became at one time his chief political advisor and clinton needed one as my life by clinton shows the president had no overall strategy and failed to see events as interconnected for him each issue needed to be examined individually and with clinton that was a laborious endeavor the prez had the painful habit of considering each argument with equal weight and therefore was extremely indecisive and cautious to take action result fiasco s like waco somalia bosnia and health care reform more seriously for the future the loss of the congress to the republicans over ten years now and counting and the failure to stop bin laden morris gives credit where credit is due though clinton s work on welfare reform cut the roll books in half and the tough work on deficit reduction allowed the economic boom of the to take place also interesting was clinton s use of the presidency as a bully pulpit for families and education an issue that was local politics and therefore cost clinton nothing in the budget but brought in massive political capital read this book before reading clinton s my life why because morris points out the inconsistencies and just plain untruths contained therein also morris says that the president s autobiography is the rosetta stone that decodes clinton if that is the case then morris is certainly the interpreter

0,i ve had this camera for years and i am glad that it broke so i can in good conscious buy a new camera it is so slow that it is impossible to catch anything but the back of my kids heads as they run away because they got tired of saying cheese i always thought the battery life was sufficient and that the quality of the images was fine but i hardly got good shots because of how slow the camera was i d put the shoot button and it would take about seconds before the camera would click i actually sent it back to the manufacturer thinking there was something wrong with it but they said it was functioning normally it was probably the most disappointing purchase i ve made
1,i love the texture of the coffee there is no bitterness and it is very smooth to where i didn t need cream to cut the flavor i am usually not a coffee drinker but a friend told me that this is one of the best she ever had this was intended to be a christmas gift for her but out of curiosity i bought one for myself to include with the bags for her i now know the difference believe me i had thought that instant tasted way better then real coffee until a i had a cup of this java i was almost tempted not to give the rest of the coffee away also the shipment was very fast i had ordered this with other items books and dvds the coffee came in within the week but the other items didn t come in at all infact every time i checked the progress amazon kept pushing the items further away in the shipment date i couldn t understand this at all i had to cancel the rest of the order and buy the items elsewhere go figure
1,this is the perfect size swimming pool for my month old she loves this pool i love the fact that only the top ring has to be blown up then once you start filling it with water it stands up less risk of tears or holes the only thing i would recommend would be some sort of cover for it since it does not come with one
1,this is the second suunto vector watch i have owned only because the first one was lost the only two draw backs of this watch is battery life and my band broke twice in two years seems to me they could offer a much longer life battery and a band that would hold up alot better the battery lasts about months only for the price of this watch you think tehy could do alittle better other than that i love the watc

0,we got this for my son we had it for months when he would get excited and try to bounce he would end up hitting his head on the hard toys last week my son hit the play bar hard enough that he loosened his top front tooth it was the scariest thing that has ever happen to me nothing is worse than seeing your helpless baby bleeding from the mouth over the course of a week he was crying and not wanting to eat much he lost the tooth on the days when he hit the play bar it cracked his tooth just below the root now he will be with out a tooth for years please choose another product for your child it s not worth the risk
0,this movie is more dark comedy and trippy foreign bizarrovision film than dyed in the wool zombie fest if you were like me who isn t well versed in the foreign horror movie scene this movie was entertaining but not what i d consider something i d add to the library thanks netflix one thing i ve found with italian horror movies they spend alot of effort on visual trippery seems they want every italian movie to be an art film and this is no exception same goes for the argento films of the past its not a bad thing just a distinctive style that you either buy into or you do not an awful lot of strange things happen for no real apparrant reason a little bit of sex again in that erotic italian artsy style a bumbling mentally retarded sidekick and a whole lot of strange implausable things happening and then eventually the movie ends the story is definately more love story dark comedy its entertaining has a few minutes of zombie suspense but its almost wrong to call this a horror film because its really not
0,the quality is not real hd looking the footage is jumpy the camera is terrible in low light even indoors during the day you have to blast light into the camera to get a readable image i returned mine and i m looking to getting the much better sony hd cam which is almost double the price but at least they were smart enough to put a video light on it being a professional filmmaker and knowing what cameras shoot real hd i quickly realized that i got ripped off this may be good only if you re shooting mostly outdoors during the day but don t expect to bring it to a party club or out on the town at night it seems like they should have devoted effort to making the low light shooting excellent the size of the camera is amazing and the fact that there are no tapes is great i was really disappointed because i was expecting something better most digital cameras shoot better video seriously
1,it s a very good product but it only can be shipped within u s so i can t buy i
1,i do not own the headset yet but i have already ordered it from amazon and it is supposed to come awhile after my xbox live starter kit so i will have to use my louzy wired controler with the stock headset until this new one comes my impression is that it will be a very good product because it is logitech and i have that wireless joystick for pc that they make and it is fablous the price great price i got mine for somthing like buy from but it looks like a great product and i look foward to reciving my headset yes hours can last me a weekend
0,i have used this procuct in the past with great success but ghost is useless symantec tech support is as far as i can tell been doing computers since the worst if you get the boxed version it says pc magzine september belongs in every serious pc user s toolbox think about it using a quote in and i would agree the sys i installed ghost is a dell boot disk will not work backup will not work blue screen when backing up tech support directed me to web sites that don t exist and the sites that did come up didn t have the files nu tech listed dell workstations and both dual processor no games scsi raid mem nvidia dual displays they crashed and had to be reformated and reinstalled system works expired i couldn t use my ghost backups and i kept getting virus pop ups that were generated by nu the systems were shipped to panama and were in customs for over mo this is not a usual event in the life of a computer but with no tech support and my computers only starting long enough to tell me sys works was not up to date i reformated i purchased in anticipation of setting up my computers boxed from amazon and download from nu ghost sys wrks prem nu int sec versions but couldn t install them that was mid december now its january and still not one answer from nu that works yes all systems are pluged in to tripplite tripplite line condidtoners batery backup units the computers lived in st maarten and the power was to volts with lots of downtime panama weather people public offices are great driver lic lic plates for years st maarten driver lic for years lic plates yr sailing is better in st maarten life in panama and i don t speek spanish yet is good norton is bad l read a lot mostly tech books i purchase tools electronic gear software computer hardware etc without amazon it would be hard to live offshore no need to go to borders amazon is online
1,i m very particular about the stuff i put on my face i ve used nivea aloe jack black kiehls baxter among others i decided to give it a shot and all i can say is wow it says it s fragrance free but it s got a small very very very small hint of lemon perhaps you only need a liberal amount and you re good to go moisture is retained with glycerin and it soothes with aloe and chamomile mmmm if you re looking for subtle yet tasteful facial lotion that s made for men you ve gota try this it s even allergy tested not to mention part of the proceeds are donated to prostate cancer research
1,this camera has the potential for pictures with amazing clarity and colors but not straight out of the camera i too was disappointed after converting the raw files with pro and acr was it possible that my d rebel would be better than this monster that gives me neck pains and has made my right arm to start looking like swartzenegger s arm even with l glass the results were dissapointing the problem is not with the camera but with the workflow after using it for months i am getting used to a workflow that will give me the results i am looking for i had to realize that this camera does not perform any processing enhancements in camera because the pros need to do it themselves once i got over the fact that i would have to sharpen and saturate colors a lot more than before i was content and have never touched the d rebel ever since ps beware of the severe neck pains when attaching any l zoom lens buy the hand strap or a better neck strap some photo samples can be found here http www trekearth com members nbournas photos

1,this product is great it is simple to use and offers everything you need to do cd and dvd recording the addition of tivo to go transfers and dvd menus make this product a true winner the only problem i have encountered is the length of encoding recordings from tivo to burn them to dvd if you need to record audio or video to cd or dvd this is the product you need don t wast time with anything else

1,i bought this stroller after having a year old peg perego hand me down i loved the old one but it looked like it had one thousand miles on it as a friend told me so i gave it to my mom to use i knew it was important to get a good stroller that would last rather than buying cheap ones i am a very price sensitive i shop at consignment shops etc and i still feel the money spent is worth it the reason i like this stroller you can guide it with one hand there is a spot for bags etc underneath the cup holder for mommy and child this is an extra accessory it s lightweight and you can pop it open and closed easily the five point harnes
0,i deinstall the product after two weeks of use it did not allow me to select adobe reader as my default program and was not able to open many pdf documents if a document was opened it was often incorrectly formatted for viewing also the feature to allow editing of the documents in word or excel was most often non functional

1,i found myself staggered with sticker shock while shopping for a decent pair of mtb glove dollars no offense to the makers of these woefully overpriced digit protectors but please i did some research on the web and the harbinger gloves received good reviews from a couple different sources the price was a fourth of the competitors so i thought why not try them out the gloves are great and i have been very pleased with their performance not only do they have a cool look factor but they also are well made there is decent cushion no gel unfortunately built into the meaty areas of the palm where you would expect and need it additionally the velcro connection comes a little higher on the wrist for full palm protection which i like another nice touch is the tough material used in the palm around the thumb and fingers it serves the dual purposes of protection and grip it is definitely tough and has handled some hard hands first touch downs on the downside i know i might get sweaty hands this summer live in sw desert because the palm area is all plastic verses leather yet this is a fair trade for the protection and rugged construction if you dont want to spend bucks on gloves and dont need to have a gel cushion these are the best bang for the buck
1,had to send back the first pair because i needed a bigger size received the second pair and credit for the first pair promptly this pair is just right will definately order again thanks

1,as soon as i saw this watch i had to get it i loved it because it had really nice details and the butterflies are beautiful it s a really nice looking and good quality watch the only problem i do have with it is that the face is quite big if you have a small wrist it is very large i still love it and would never return it but feel like it could be a lot smaller

1,the leek is a wonderful knife but its sword like point is subject to breakage throwing the knife into a wooden target will invariably break the tip which is what happened to two of my leeks fortunately kershaw lives up to its lifetime guarantee policy and quickly replaced both of my broken knives with brand new ones no questions asked i just shipped them the knife explaining what happened and a week later got back a new knife the knife itself opens beautifully though i ve found that the liner lock sometimes sticks and isn t that easy to depress with one hand
1,this is some great coffee perks you up gets you moving a good tasting highly energized morning wake up even better as an afternoon pick me up even thinking about making coffee now just wakes me up
0,i was attracted to the thermoskin product because it looked more comfortable than rigid splints for night wear and because thermoskin advertised that it could be worn while sitting during the day the product indeed has a clever seeming design and it is well manufactured but ultimately this product seems to me to be too floppy and unstable to consistently stretch out the area of the foot that feels to me like it needs to be stretched i e the area along the sole of my foot that i can feel stretching out in the mornings when before getting out of bed and while sitting up in it i press my toes hard against a looped cord or towel that stretch significantly diminishes my pain upon standing up out of bed the velcro fastenings are indeed secure but the product s sock like sleeve and ankle cuff move around some even when the straps are cinched down as tight as they ll go as a result what feels like an appropriate stretch typically disappears in about five or ten minutes of normal movement and friction in bed while lying down worse the angle created by pulling the strap up through the buckle in front of the lower leg just doesn t create the proper stretch instead it just makes my toes feel crampy i m going to try a rigid split which may be less comfortable but i believe that i need to be strapped into something that consistently maintains a proper angle which the thermoskin product doesn t and i d rather incur some discomfort if it will actually help me get well than continue to use this not too uncomfortable but ineffective product from thermoskin perhaps others have had or will have better results with it than i have had and i have no medical training nor deep insight into the anatomy or physiology beyond what i ve read on the internet so consider this to be very much a layman s review i ve been suffering from plantar faciitis now for about four to five months with little improvement and i can t compare this product to others that i hope might be more effective but i was very disappointed in this product and regret having spent the money for it
1,if you ever played any kotor game u know that its the king of rpgs and i know that u all want the game to come out to but it isent the game got cancelled and a bunch of guys online are tryin to resurect the kotor series by making this petition we dont have no where nere as much as we should round so help us out and go to petition online and help us resurect this great series

0,it sucks it breaks easy and doesn t work good dont waste your money like i di
0,i loved the first xenosaga then this arrived episode isen t a bad game in terms of the story the intro is absolutely dynamite then you get into a battle now if you like tactical stuff this is a good game for you but if you re trying to fight your way through a hoard of enemies to get to a save point in record timing i say save your money gone is the amazingly well done battle system in the first episode in its place stands a completely out of nowhere new way of battling that takes minutes to get rid of a couple of easy enemies the easy ones in this game have around hps ridiculous but that s not all the enemies have weak zones that depend of the height of the attack that you input the zones are a b and c a being the highest triangle c square b and circle a sometimes see what i mean it s completely screwed up and you have to become deeply addicted to the game to understand its full potential and if that wasn t enough they changed the voice actors too kos mos s voice sounds more like an operator than a robot s and momo sounds like a brat at least chaos voice has improved i d prefer playing episode twice than playing this i just hope namco comes out with a better sequel otherwise spend your moey on something else like shadow hearts for example
0,private resort is the kind of movie that was geared towards young adult audiences in the mid when sexual awareness and exposition were the hot ticket in theatres however i m sure this film is one that johnny depp hector elizondo and rob morrow aren t proud to have on their resume the movie s plot is slim and neither morrow or depp have any screen presence in this early stage of their careers elizondo tries gamely and pulls off a few laughs but he s not at his best either most of the film s laughs come from leslie hope as a slightly off kilter cosmic bimbo dody goodman as a dotty old lady who knows karate and tony azito as a bumbling hotel security guard there s lots of slapstick some of it works most of it doesn t you can do better folks
1,my daughter loves sims so i got this to help her improve her spanish it is fun to play for adults too the complete immersion method is more effective for learning a new language

0,this particular sudoku handheld was not as expected it has only basic functions and the person i purchased for said it is easier just to do sudoku on line or in the newspaper or in a puzzle book really inconvenient functions may be good for young children but not adults
1,i have a phone and used the cable to connect to a windows xp home system the shippment came extremely quick installation was seemless and the drivers from xp worked just fine and recognized the cable immediately downloaded the nokie suite software from the nokia site to work with the cable and phone and that also worked just fine cellphone companies wanted bucks for the same cable use this one you will save money and its the same cable
1,msr s pocket rocket is a great little cooker best for going light and fast perfect as a shared stove among two people and even better for simple boiling or melting snow for drinking water i would suggest this stove for use with a maximum pot capacity of two liters more than this and it becomes a little unstable if your menu is simple and you live on instant meals that require only boiling water this is the stove for you because this is a stove designed for the minimalist it is tiny and has a very concentrated hot spot so if you are a backcountry gourmet and want to cook pancakes and eggs you might be better off with a stove that has a larger flame spread again great for boiling water and melting snow but not for actual cooking
1,i picked up a copy of health at my local grocery store mostly out of curiosity i found myself enjoying it enough so that i will be ordering a subscription here s why it encompasses every facet of health not just diet or exercise as one reviewer noted it is broken down into categories looks living moving feeling and flavor it was just redone the articles in each seem to be well written and are enjoyable i particularly enjoy the feeling and living sections as they are something that is rarely found in other magazines unlike many other magazines i found myself marking or wanting to mark so many pages to keep or check out further that in ended up being a good part of the magazine i like most others enjoy getting the most for my money while everyone has a different idea of what constitutes a good magazine this one will soon be a regular fixture in our house
1,my daughter and i have searched for a sunscreen that both of us would like and never found one that was completely satisfactory she has oily skin prone to breakouts and mine is combination every one we tried always left a greasy feel and look to the face even the ones that were supposed to be oil free finally i came across a review of this product on paula begoun s website www cosmeticscop com the review sounded good so i went out and bought some right away my daughter and i both love this product it s the only sunscreen we have ever used that doesn t leave a greasy feel or look to the skin it dries to a matte finish and works very very well under foundation too without foundation there is no need to use powder to kill the shine and it feels so light on the skin you barely know it s there if you have oily or combination skin and have never found a sunscreen that doesn t look and feel greasy try this one it s the best
0,we received the product on time however the oil container had leaked inside the trumpet box and it smelled real bad we had to leave the box in the sunshine for almost a week and still it smells bad as for the trumpet itself after a few lessons at school one of the keys keeps getting stuck and has to be manually pulled out to the normal position
1,this kava stress relief tea from yogi tea is for anxiety relief it s an unusual tea slightly sweet it contains stevia and very carob y the good news is that it does not have any of the usual kava taste or smell that many people find offensive the bad news is that i can t feel any of the anxiety relief effects of the tea although it does say that there are of kava root extract in the tea still it s a lovely cup of tea and relaxing because it just tastes good i can also taste the spiciness of the tea which is very pleasant i usually brew two bags in one cup which is recommended on the package for a stronger and more relaxing effect however i even tried four bags once but still didn t notice a relaxing effect i am familiar with kava and the overall effect of kava is pretty subtle anyway so this is something to be aware of your experience of the tea may be different kava stress relief tea comes with an expiration date a good thing because it s not full of preservatives plus you can tell if it is fresh and has many organic ingredients the ingredients in kava stress relief tea are kava root extract carob pod indian sarsaparilla root organic cinnamon bark organic ginger root organic cardamom seed stevia leaf barley malt natural hazelnut flavor natural cinnamon flavor and natural licorice flavor amazingly i can taste many of these in this lovely and complex cup of tea i would rate the taste five stars for flavor and uniqueness yogi tea seems to be another company like numi aspen traditional medicinals that values sustainable and healthy practices their web site has a helpful glossary of tea ingredients and is beautifully designed with info about each tea they make their tea bag tags have metaphysical sayings on them like your breath is the voice of your soul and your head must bow to your heart yogi tea writes this on the box about the tea s benefits kava stress relief tea helps you calm down as it relieves stress anxiety and minor pain as well as lending gentle support to the digestion and the kidneys a member of the peppercorn family kava piper methysticum is a highly prized medicinal and beverage plant whose primary benefit is alleviating anxiety kava kava native to oceania and the south pacific islands has been used and cultivated for its ability to calm the body and mind and encourage a good night s sleep a powerful antispasmodic this herb promotes a state of relaxed unconcern while compromising neither mental functions nor clarity of thought when used appropriately furthermore kava has been shown to relax the uterus and relieve menstrual cramps and minor menopausal symptoms the herb research foundation indicates that scientific data supports the use of kava for minor anxiety stress restlessness muscle tension and mild pain for added flavor our formula has been complemented with stevia sarsaparilla and organic carob enjoy a warm soothing cup of kava stress relief a delicious way to relax in addition to the standard disclaimer that the tea is not intended to diagnose treat cure or prevent any disease there is a warning on the box ask a healthcare professional before use if you have or have had liver problems frequently use alcoholic beverages or are taking any medication stop use and see a doctor if you develop symptoms that may signal liver problems e g unexplained fatigue abdominal pain loss of appetite fever vomiting dark urine pale stools yellow eyes or skin not for use by persons under years of age or by pregnant or breastfeeding women not for use with alcoholic beverages excessive use or use with products that cause drowsiness may impair your ability to operate a vehicle or heavy equipment note that the media scare about kava several years ago was not for the kava root and it is my opinion that based on my own research that kava is very safe however i am not a physician and if you have any health concerns you should check with an appropriate professional i decided to give kava stress relief tea four stars since it didn t really work for me still it is a wonderful and recommended tea and may work for you
1,this radar laser detector is very good detects the police radar and the best is do not false signals
1,when funds were tight i had a difficult time deciding which magazine subscriptions to keep each women s magazine has a slightly different feel in the writing though with increased competition these styles seem to be in flux i finally decided that i preferred the writing in bazaar and was getting tired of what i felt was vogue s cosmopolitan attempt to catch a larger readership if i want to subscribe to cosmo i ll bloody well subscribe the featured designers are more cutting edge and less mainstream than what is found in vogue it s a bit snottier though there are far snottier magazines if you are looking for extreme fashions among my complaints bazaar is an obviously thinner magazine and while most of vogue s content is adverts it does seem to have more articles another item that i find highly irritating is bazaar s society items i really don t give a who is wearing what at what charity gala especially when i don t play footsies with these people those complaints aside this is still my favorite fashion magazine
1,i love sunflower seeds chocolate and cherries so you can imagine my delight when i found these chocolate cherry sunflower seeds available on amazon when the packet arrived i tore it open and downed the entire contents into my eager mouth expecting an explosion of chocolate cherry sunflowery sapidity instead i got a mouthful of hard shells i crunched through the tough outer hulls wondering at the inventiveness of the manufacturers who had somehow injected chocolate and cherry flavors into hard unopened shells but then as i macerated both hull and softer kernel into a splintery mash found that the chocolate and cherry flavors had somehow gone missing when my wife came home i mentioned to her how i was ripped off by the chocolate cherry sunflower seeds which lacked both chocolate and cherry flavors and in fact were barely edible my wife picked up the empty packet looked at it for a moment and then hit me over the head with a dining room chair you idiot she said these seeds are for planting she then clobbered me with an antique oak coat tree i don t know why i ever married you she continued you are always doing stupid embarrassing things and no matter how hard i hit you you never learn she then whacked me with the coffee table for emphasis maybe i had gotten a bad batch of seeds i think i will order them again and the next time the manufacturers had better not forget the chocolate and cherry flavors or someone is going to get a beating
1,i have several fossil watches and every time i needed to adjust the band it cost me around i found this tool and figured it was worth a try i was able to remove links from of my fossil watches though my newest fossil watch band was too wide to easily fit in the tool i even used it to adjust watches for of my friends it worked well made the adjustments and they were very happy with it they plan to buy it for themselves you do have to make sure the pin lines up correctly with the pin but beyond that it works like a dream

1,i purchased this program about years ago i have been casually studying german through other programs for about years the best basic words only is through unforgettable languages very basic but easy as heck to learn rosetta stone is the best for understanding gender verb usage and adapting to the german style of sentence structure i absolutely love all the functionality and versatility of the program it is incredibly challenging to go from reading to typing and to speaking the only negative is that the cd has to be used to run the program even with an accelerated cd rom the starting stopping of the cd is distracting if that feature were corrected it would be perfect
1,how to steal a million was a light hearted farce starring too skilled performers in their own right audrey hepburn is delightful as the sweetheart bedazzled by peter o toole an expert in forged art works the two have you rooting for them in their improbable caper once you remind yourself that this is all just healthy fun than you can enjoy their performances greed becomes almost a worthy attribute as they endeavor to outwit the perfect security system guarding unknowingly a fake artwork it is all good fun as the security system is foiled without harming a hair on anyone s head dishonesty doesn t enter your mind as the caper comes to a pleasant climax everyone ends up with their reputation intact and some spare change jingling in their pockets the two stars are engaging and carefree and are so effortless in their actions that they are a joy to watch mind candy doesn t necessarily have to rot your brain it can give you some mindless enjoyment on a quiet night

1,we tried three other brands and types of gates on the market two were plastic and the third was a metal gate ordered from one of the pet catalogs costing the two plastic gates each broke within days of being installed and the other metal gate was stiff and hard to use and took over an hour to actually install this evenflo gate was put together installed and in full use within minutes of arriving and the dogs haven t been able to budge it one inch plus it looks good and blends with the taupe ricepaper on the walls great product at a bargain price we re ordering three more
1,it is nice if you are looking for a simple hair dryer it does its job pretty nicely the dual voltage option is a plus as you can use it anywhere in the world a little big for travelling but compromises with its folding handle and light weight the disadvantage is that you cant use it on the high in voltage it is hard because you might tend to put it on high and then that would kill the equipment
1,i used to buy pods at starbucks but i started longing for something a little more authentic luckily my fiancee bought me the podmerchant megasampler as a christmas present i was overwhelmed i never knew there were so many different kinds of espresso pods available especially from one store the selection in this sampler is huge and it includes both caffeinated and decaf pods there is also the super sampler but it doesn t include decaf which is nice sometimes in the evening after trying these pods we found which espressos we liked best and have been buying those but it all started with the mega sampler the shipping was also very fast if you re looking to expand your coffee horizons and have an espresso pod machine you ll almost certainly find some new favorites in here

0,this tricycle is simply way too big while the seat position is adjustable even when adjusted this thing is simply huge i imagine my year old will have to double in leg length to be able to ride this monster by then he ll be or and be plenty big enough for a normal size bike so i just don t get the point of this why in the world would someone build a trike so big i did like that the trike had large pneumatic tires and was fairly sturdy at least in terms of construction i suppose if you have a really large child that wants a trike instead of a bike maybe this monster would be ok i did have a few issues with design and or build quality though first the grips are fairly fragile plastic and i imagine will break after just a tumble or two second the way the seat adjustment works is simply by sliding the seat clamp up and down the main support bar this would be ok but the seat clamp was too big for the support bar so i had to shim it with something to get it to stay in place overall i m just not very impressed
1,i get compliments every time i wear this i took a chance because i tend to be a bit plump as other reviewers noted the sleeves do run snug but otherwise it s a great jacket at a great price the grommets are just so fun it is fully lined i just love this modern addition and it s not too young feeling just right
0,i do not usually take the time to write reviews on products if i am not satisfied with something i would return it and write a reason for the return the kids used this product up in about an hour so there wasn t much to send back when i was a kid we had spirograph and it was a great thing the reviews for the current model said that spirograph was just a memory and the new one was a cheap copy that didn t work i am glad that the reviews were there for that product to save money i ordered this low cost spin doodles toy five year old kids are always excited to open a toy to check it out i played with them for a little while to get them started and realized that we had a box of junk why would someone go through the trouble to develope and manufacture a toy and then sell it on the internet when it is not really usable the gears and holder for the paper were a mess of poorly designed and warped plastic at least the cost was low this one was a waste of shipping cost even if the toy was free i hope this helps someone who remembers spirograph and what a great creative toy it was to years ago i guess the technology has been lost for toys with plastic gears

0,this thing came off as episodes of a weekly night time soap that was squished down into hours characters weren t given clear introductions or motivations they react in ways that don t make much sense and the accents come go and change into new accents altogether while the format reminds me of a primetime soap the acting unfortunately smacks of daytime which is odd considering the long careers of many of the people involved
0,good things baby loves watching the hanging toys the nature sounds are very well done and very pleasant bad things very troublesome to assemble the supplied screws are a cheap metal and they are screwed into plastic threads in the most critical support structure the kickstand i could not get all of the screws into their holes completely before the screws stripped out but i did get it together well enough to use however i considered returning it to the store during assembly the vibration feature broke after about month of use baby cannot reach the toys even at months of age and we have a very tall baby toys are very easily removed from their holes so that you can t really move the chair without the toys falling out the rocker has a very big footprint it takes up about half of the surface area of our four seat kitchen table
1,malphurs does an excellent job of laying out the strategic planning process step by step and in great detail i really appreciated the fact that he takes into account things like church patriarchs matriarchs and other church dynamics that are often not addressed practically in ministry books he almost makes the process seem easy and maybe it is if you are starting a new church or are in the very early stages of a church plant however much of the material seems practically impossible to implement in a plateau ed or downward spiraling church that has been around for years the principles are easy and make sense if you have support of the congregation that s pretty hard to do in most of the churches i ve been in that need strategic planning the most that s no fault of malphurs the book itself is a great book
0,this product never made it to destination it was purchased with pants to match which were pin striped and didn t and it was never sent to the recipient nor was i invoiced so i am currious if the seller plans to at this point or even if they intend to send the correct pants all i know is that with everything else being late for shipping durring the holiday and the wrong products otherwise i will not purchase from this seller again
0,the worst thing for this is you have to bring a bench of disc with you and replace disc every min if you are capturing hd video i think most of buyers would take hd video if you buy a hd camcorder but a small disc can only hold min hd video have to change disc time by time the cmos sensor is worse than ccd but it is the best sensor among cmos in this price today a lot of noise will come in low light condition i bought it for and return it i think you d better buy with a hard drive that would be a much better one
0,this toy was a huge disappointment for me my boys took one look at it and threw it i thought it was much bigger than what it is i was also upset that i spent as much as i did and it wasn t even a decent size my boys are moving to a car themed room and it just wasn t what i envisioned it also only says one thing which can be quite boring for small children
1,a great shoe i was very impressed with the softeness of the leather immediate comfort and versatility of this shoe this is definitely a well made year round slide if you are looking for a classic loafer this is your shoe
0,i have an amazon bookmark that advertises ludlum s book the sigma protocol it says in ludlum s latest an ordinary man battles a global conspiracy well gee that s the plot of this book as well come to think of it that s the plot of every book by the man that i ve read a vast right wing conspiracy is set to take over the world they have small armies a lot of money and a plan this time around a group of military men naturally plan to foment terror and use the chaos to implement their vision of the world laugh not millions in the middle east and far left believe was something along the same lines enter ordinary man joel converse he s a vietnam vet and p o w who thought he had left that life far behind it s up to him to save the world he will survive certain death several times the bad guys always seem to think they need him alive and they just have to explain their conspiracy to this total stranger he will find love and he ll visit several european cities to boot of course a suspension of disbelief is essential for many novels how else would you believe that a nazi and an israeli are on the same side but ludlum s cliched stories are further worsened by the fact that he just couldn t write his dialogue writing is always tedious and sometimes just painful to read action scenes are generic the only thing he could do right is character background but that s not enough to save this the aquitaine progression might make a half decent tv movie but to endure pages is just too much
1,i just finished up my first bag of this coffee it s great i normally buy starbucks breakfast blend just so you know for comparisons purpose but i am switching to this brand it s just the perfect blend for me smooth but strong enough to wake me up
1,this product is fine however it was much too baggy i m not that skinny and i felt like the excess leg space made me look ridiculous there is nothing wrong with the short but i just wish i had bought a smaller size definitely go with the smaller size if you buy this product
1,i purchased this outdoor atomic clock three months ago and hung it out by our backyard pool it is sheltered a bit by the roof overhang but it still gets some blowing wind and rain so far the clock has kept perfect atomic time the temperature indicator is a bit small so we really can t see that feature from the pool deck but the hands on the clock are easy to read this clock serves our purpose perfectly i have read reviews that say outdoor clocks like this aren t really suited for the weather but i have no complaints and it s been days of crazy florida weather we got the clock with free shipping so the price was right too great clock great deal

0,the characters are uninteresting and dimensional the dialog hackneyed i have no idea why it s on the new york times bestseller list it was more of an obligation for me to finish this book than anything else don t waste your money
0,this product flat out sucks ive been shaving my head for years and never had issues with clippers had a basic remington before this product gives me nothing but trouble
0,well i ordered this online as we couldn t find any window mounted feeders locally it s lasted exactly two weeks the problem is the extremely weak design the glass feeder is fairly heavy too heavy to stay attached to any glass with two measly suction cups as this has there are somewhat strange instructions with this model directing the user to rub the suction cups for several minutes in order to supposedly build up a proper suction then the glass slides into a groove well the thing worked at first until i had to slide out the glass bottle portion to refill it i did it as gingerly as i could not disturbing my preciously attached suction cups refilled it only halfway and replaced it about minutes went by and then the entire thing glass suction cups everything fell to our deck breaking into a million thick glass shards frustrating me the hummers and our two dogs banished from the outside until i could clean up this mess what a crummy product and overpriced although i wouldn t buy it again for two cents beware
1,nothing deep by any means but simply a light airy listen with a compilation of quirky tropical tunes even though the songs most of them weren t in the movie they remind me of it of the whole hawaiian atmosphere my favorite tracks excluding the ones included on the previous cd are blue hawai i by elvis my little grass shack coconut it s just bizarre but addicting making you smile with absurdity island in the sun pineapple princess and love me tender again it s nothing dramatic or swirling but it you adored lilo stitch and how can you not and all it stood for this cd might just bring some warmth into a cold day don t think about it listen and pretend you re there
1,first off let me say for the most part katamari damacy is an amazing game if you don t know the story behind it well it wasn t thought up by game designers and that s why it s so original the game ideas came from a lady who didn t even like video games and they used her ideas to make it in a world where if you ve played one rpg you ve played them all if you ve played one shooter you ve played them all etc katamari damacy is a huge breath of fresh air and i m glad it s popular the music is strangely catchy it has a great sense of humor the attention to detail is absolutely astounding a ton of work must have went into this game and it s surprisingly very addictive and fun in fact unless you ve actually played this game you won t understand how fun and addictive it is show me many games and i can say i d like that or i wouldn t like that but katamari damacy is a game you actually have to play to understand and there s even a player mode where you can compete against a friend you roll around a katamari a ball of stuff and pick up more and more stuff that automatically sticks to your katamari the bigger your katamari gets the bigger stuff you can pick up if this sounds stupid to you there s a reason you haven t played it yet trust me it rocks while katamari damacy looks like a kid s game it s not there s too much strategy too much nuance here for young minds on the other hand younger kids can play chess so maybe but generally kids play stuff like halo that requires little thought my complaint is level i ve tried about times to beat this level and from what i see i don t think i will ever be able to so for me the game stops here it has a minute time limit and the closest i ve got cm i need to get to m i m not a gaming genius or anything but i m at least an average gamer and regularly play online against other gamers and do very well in my opinion they really dropped the ball on this level with such a strict requirement to be honest i m really surprised anybody has beaten this level with so little time how many more times should i try it s disappointing maybe me and my katamari is more gaming friendly another thing is the view on the screen isn t quite big enough it s very easy to be lost with so little of a view you can t change the camera angle you can only turn around it would probably be better with a bigger camera view and a camera that changes angles automatically also the controls to turn around and charge are too difficult to turn around you press and at the same time why not just have us a press a button to charge you flip the analog sticks up and down really fast too much trouble for a feature that s pretty useless anyway why would you want to run when you ll just run into something anyway the game consists of a lot of moving back and forth and to the side you don t need to move forward fast so it s not a perfect game but it s very impressive nonetheless i just wish i could play the rest of it
1,i recently gave up coffee made the switch to teas lipton other grocery blends were bitter or weak i purchased the loose tea leaves from amazon at a good price quick shipping english friends suggested pj tips tea which we found ordered from another online site twinning s blows it away both the earl grey irish blend are great both on the pallet to the nose

1,good price for a good working clock clock sets itself in about hours not bad would have been nice if had acutal barometric pressures instead of the picture of the sun or clouds and trending arrow
0,man were we diappointed with this ge phone we did everything right trained the battery in the beginning made sure we routinely charged it never dropped or abused this phone and then one day it started not holding a charge we couldn t figure it out it worked fine for about a year and then completely crapped out just like the other reviewers have said we had a year old toshiba that was so fabulous and reliable up to it s unfortunate demise which is when we acquired this loser are there any good phones out there somewhere
1,for all you non believers out there buy this game i was like you reading the reviews looking at the box in various stores pondering considering thinking to myself should i buy this game now that i finally spent the mere and played the game i am wondering why i didn t do so sooner as an avid playstation supporter stood in line for hours and paid over for my back in the day this game contains nearly flawless gaming entertainment cinematically driven storyline supurbly coordinated character control creative levels and character design great soundtrack decent bosses pretty cool power moves and importantly puzzles are not overly frustrating to the point of throwing your controller through the tv screen except for maybe climbing the rotating spike columns in closing all i gotta say is the same thing i said my first sentence of this review buy this game
0,my own fault for not reading the ingredients but the marketing info on this product is extremely misleading basically it s a bag of blueberry candy high fructose corn syrup is the second ingredient oil and flavoring also added i don t have anything against candy but this stuff left my teeth tingling for hours after i ate it i actually had to brush my teeth twice this product should not be in the natural and organic category don t waste your money

1,though this movie is not the stage version it is just as good bill benson bing crosby and ted adams donald o conner decide to do a broadway show together however they need a leading lady well ted and the director decide that if bill should run across the right girl sign her so bill sets off to paris and ted for london well bill discovers a girl mitzy gaynor not knowing that ted found and signed a girl in paris jeanmaire when the two find out it is total chaos especially trying to keep the two girls from finding out about eachother on the way home all the while trying to get the other to tell their girl to leave things seem to be going fine until the two men begin to fall in love with eachothers leading lady the movie has great porter songs de lovely anything goes second hand turban blow gabe blow i get a kick out of you you re the top and a fabulous tap number with donald you can bounce right back phil harris also stars in this fantastic de lovely movie
0,surely i m not the only one who found this book totally bad the only thing it made me wonder about is how it s possible to write such a thorougly boring book about such fascinating women the writing is just dull and full of the author s biases and prejudices which just aren t nearly as interesting as the subjects themselves it s written in that old school feminism negative no fun tone that thank god feminism has since moved beyond my advice find another book about women mystics not filtered through flinder s lens
0,even for only these weren t worth the money they came smelling extremely strongly of turpentine or some other noxious chemical and now at least months since i have received them the smell has not dissipated they are extremely stiff so even if they didn t reek i still wouldn t wear them b c my feet would be in tatters by mid day i guess that s what i get for buying cheap shoes
0,i like this hairdryer when it works it has broken twice on me the first time it starting spitting out sparks so i sent it back they sent me a new one of course i had to get a temporary one because it took a while to get it back and now it only works on low the high is broken i am going to throw it out and get a different brand not impressed

0,i have oily blemish prone skin and i was told by my mother who used to work for the clinique estee lauder family to give their products a try because they are supposed to be non cosmogenic this product irritated my skin so much that i just had to rinse it off to relieve the itchiness the only reason why i used it more than once was because it was supposed to leave behind a tingling sensation to show if it was working if it was working it hurt like hell and it made my face break out with more acne than i ever had all at once not worth your money
0,the whole purpose is to store toys up off the floor of the tub but that is impossible since it won t stick to tile above the tub i hadn t even put any toys in it and it wouldn t stick i returned it and found something on one step ahead

0,i ve used ms streets and trips for years with minor problems this year i upgraded to a windows vista laptop and wanted the latest software for it i have a gps and i use a pocket pc pda so i need pocket streets after i got home i read the fine print on the box it list support for no higher than the windows xp os but so far the program is running fine on my vista machine the laptop has no serial com ports and s t won t detect a usb port the description of s t which includes a gps indicates it uses a usb port but apparently it needs the included usb adaptor i could not locate where i could purchase such an adapter s t no longer ships with pocket streets nor could i locate where i could download a copy i can for now use my old pocket streets program because does export pocket street maps finally within two miles of my home the map list an airport and runway that was shut down in the early s the main highway a few blocks from me has only exits in miles yet s t list over a dozen intersections which means when i get directions i always end up down a dead end road i ve purchase many versions of streets and trips and this is the first time i felt i ve wasted my money open software can t be returned from where i purchased it i guess i ll have to start researching other software packages
1,every time this movie comes on my husband who is english and i watch it and laugh our heads off if you have ever been in an english train station drinking weak watery cups of tea out of dirty cracked cups smelling mildew and stale cigarettes while you freeze to death you would see the humor in anyone being romantically moved while sitting there and not to be crule but these are not exactly a couple of sex pots the thought of two stodgy old english people being driven wild by their passion for each other is well hilarious i give it stars for being so darn funny oh and the music please but it is worth watching for a good laugh
0,well now this carry case is a goner the latch will no longer close and the top rim is hopelessly bent it was fun while it lasted
1,one of the must see christmas movies a family oriented movie that will rekindle the christmas spirit in everyone we have this on vcr tape and have watched it so much that we purchased the dvd version enjoy
0,the music of dowland is wonderful but sting isn t up to interpreting it you can t even distinguish the words half the time just a jumble of nice sounds from his pretty tenor he doesn t possess the skills to carry it off this music has to be interpreted by someone with an ability to express thoughts in heightened language sting for all his merits hasn t got that in his repertoire yet it s an exercise in pretention laughable at times the letter reading is ridiculous i love both sting s voice and dowland s song but this cd is a failure
0,i have only found one place to buy probe covers for this thing so i bought a lot they aren t the same manufacturer but they are the exact type of probe covers hope this helps others looking for covers for this if the first years doesn t sell probe covers for this anymore they shouldn t let companies sell the thermometer either http www shoplet com office db htm

1,i reserved the star rating for this unit as i haven t authored or copied very many dvds with it yet however what i have accomplished with it is commendable i can copy an entire commercial dvd movie all the extras under minutes i have composed a slide show dvd with my own background music selections and am quite pleased with it so far no coasters i am now in the process of producing dvds of my old home movies the converter is giving me more problems than anything still recommend the px for anyone interested in an external burner installation was a snap plug n play
1,this was the only place i could find turbo tax where i did not have to pay extra for state tax i live in washington and we do not have state income tax i even asked intuit how to get a version without the state tax they said that was not possible i have used turbo tax for many years and i will buy from amazon again next year too bad some people can not read and then blame someone else for problems they caused sound like a couple of year olds the only down side for me i received an email from amazon saying shipment would be delayed days days later the software arrivied right on the day amazon originally said it should don t know why they sent the day delay email
0,this joke book suks if i can give it any star i want i would give it a stars i never actually bought it but i borrowed it from a friend i needed a joke book for my anouncements on the intercom every morning and it only lasted days and i ran out of good jokes some of the jokes arnt appropriate and most of them dont make sense if your gonna buy a joke book dont buy this
0,this salmon jerky is so unbelievably tough it is pretty much inedible and when you do painstakingly gnaw on it it doesn t release much flavor but instead just turns into sharpish little sticks in your mouth i had the misfortune of ordering this and of the bags are still untouched and i m not sure what to do with them i even tried soaking the jerky and tried boiling it with some macaroni and nothing seems to soften this stuff up what a waste of money go for some beef jerky instead and if you need salmon eat it fresh or canned this product is a joke
1,just got this in the mail if i allow si to charge my credit card now for a subscription that isn t due to renew until they will send me issues for or per issue i have the right to discontinue this automatic billing at any time so there is a very slight savings somewhat offset by the fact that they will use my for an extra months or so recognizing that at the typical bank interest rate of that interest is worth about cents so i guess it pushes the per issue rate up to
0,there is one thing that every cookbook author can learn from how to cook without a book recipes and techniques every cook should know by heart by pam anderson not the big breasted one and that is the art of the highly marketable title for starters this artful moniker really plays on the single gal s fears about never being able to put together nutritious attractive varied affordable and delicious meals for her future family every single night of the week you want your kids to be armed with more than some simple carbohydrates when you send them off into the big bad world so the plus side of this book is the title that s where it ends the big idea here is to help the reader become a non cookbook consulting cook by a teaching basic cooking techniques that are conducive to variation and b suggesting mnemonic devices for said cooking techniques sounds interesting so far right well the problem is that almost all the recipes rely on canned low sodium chicken broth which i think is a bit of a weird ingredient it s even included in the salad dressings other big hitters include heavy cream butter and sour cream do people really eat like this regularly why not make the easy fruit parfaits for a quick and sweet ending to your meal just take a tall glass drop in a few spoonfuls of sour cream then a few spoonfuls of brown sugar and some berries repeat until the glass is filled crikey sour cream brown sugar and berries wouldn t it be just as easy to put the berries in yoghurt sweetened with a little squirt of greek honey am i totally off base thinking that this sounds much more appetizing or if calories are no object anyway why not pick up some baskin robbins rocky road on the way home from work that s easy and it s worth the internal havoc it will cause oh and here s a sample mnemonic device that i can t not share it s that good cook tender vegetables with garlic and oil then toss in some pasta that s fresh from the boil pure genius right right in a way the author was right i can cook all these things without a book but why would i want to
1,this dvd possesses some of the best editing and production that i have yet to see in a child development product each of the sections cognitive physical and language is well researched it s easy to understand and highly accessible just as perfect for a personal library as it is for staff development
0,i would have to agree with the preivous comments that state that this magazine isn t worthy of its title i subscribed before reading review i was hoping to find an affordable psychology based read though some stories are interesting i m sure i d be able to find them in other magazines like vogue or cosmo and there is plenty of ads probably more than stories and much like other reviewers when i first ordered it it took forever for the first issue to arrive now its more regular but my subscription will soon end with no renewal of course
0,this product does not cool down the car it is too small i would not use this on an expensive car because the weatherstrips that you need to install the product can be easily cut with a razor blade allowing for easy access to your car locks if you buy this please do not leave your pets or kids in the car and think that it is safe

0,its disgusting that any company would make this figure into a toy complete with knives geez give the kid a manuel next time
1,for those of us brought up on vegemite marmite doesn t make the grade for those brought up on marmite vegemite seems a poor substitute for americans who only seem to put sweet stuff on their cake oops i mean bread both are revolting i think that a major reason why americans abhor these savoury spreads is that being used to spreading honey and jam on their breakfast toast they tend to use like quantities of vegemite or marmite to uninitiated the taste of either spread applied so lavishly is going to be overwhelming before passing judgment on these spreads you would do well to heed the advice of joanna or mtspace and apply thinly it also works best with very fresh bread or hot toast incidentally i believe that marmite was first vegemite was an australian imitation created several years later it was originally called parwill a pun which will be appreciated by aussies and brits but which may not be understood by americans because of the way the words are pronounced i only give marmite four stars that probably tells you my upbringing
0,does the unit work well yes to a degree it takes holes to lock on to the satellites and then does a fair job of giving distances the display is poor and though they say up to objects per hole there is normally objects per hole all this depends upon the skycaddie course recorder the user you can not modify the course or add any objects that the course recorder didn t think was important now the bad part the unit attaches via button and belt clip like a cell phone my button part that attaches to main unit has died twice in the first days when it breaks again which it will often the unit will probally hit the dirt this isn t good but fear not it will be packed away weeks trying to get in touch with skygolf and another week to get a replacement button which has been modified even weaker than the original one now my replacement broke on the first time i clipped it to the belt now back to skycaddie to get another after being on hold for another hour they need to transfer you to another tech that handles parts this will take another hour you then get a message to leave a message normally within a week someone will call you back by normally i mean about of the time you leave messages they return them would i buy another duh no

1,having just spent the last few months reading all five books in the three musketeer series the following are my suggestions read all five books in order the man in the iron mask is probably enjoyable on its own but reading the four books that proceed it help place the story in its proper context think of the man in the iron mask as the dessert in a five course meal dessert is great but the four proceeding course are also enjoyable getting to the end of the book was especially enjoyable knowing that i was finishing a page experience read the oxford university editions there are wonderful end notes that help the reader keep track of the characters and events when you read pages you need that type of assistance to keep things straight the introductions are also very well written and help the reader get back into focus before beginning the next chapter if you really like any one book in particular go to the internet and purchase a well illustrated used hardback edition for your collection i purchased a used three musketeers with illustrations by maurice leloir the three hundred plus illustrations make that edition especially enjoyable along with sir walter scott alexandre dumas created the genre of the historical adventure novel i have been reading these types of novels my entire life beyond a doubt alexandre dumas is the master virtuoso of this genre
1,if you wonder why you re feeling lethargic or if you have one of those little abdominal paunches you thought was just advancing age then you might need probiotic therapy you might even need it if your resistance to colds is low because we live much cleaner lives than our ancestors did sterilizing our dishes putting our food in the fridge and spraying pesticides on everything we live our lives virtually bacteria free free of the good bacteria that is the baddies seem to still get us and without the good ones to balance them out we re in trouble a lack of friendly bacteria in your intestines can cause problems throughout your body to put it in nice terms it s a little like having backed up plumbing inside you and the world just ain t gonna be right until you fix it i started on probiotic therapy several months ago and i was amazed at the following things that happened almost immediately that little stomach paunch went away i kid you not talk about an instant self esteem booster my chronic men cover your ears yeast infections decreased dramatically even without my eliminating wheat from my diet which i know i ought to do i had more energy and felt more like the me of years ago i became more resistant to colds than i used to be if you re considering supplementing your diet with probiotics you should know that not all of them are created equal in fact testing done by www consumerlab com indicates that the vast majority of probiotic supplements don t deliver the number of live organisms they claim not even close those little creatures are very delicate and things like processing shipping and sitting on your shelf can kill them and let s not even talk about what your stomach acid does to them primal defense is one of the few supplements that delivers the amount of probiotics it claims to i can tell from its effects on me in addition it contains lots of good for you green foods that also help build that all important inner strength one very important caveat about primal defense though because it s so effective don t even think about starting out taking tablets a day not unless you don t mind a lot of abdominal discomfort and are able to spend several days all by yourself at home i took one a day for about months and then i finally felt ready to move up to it ll be at least another month before i m up to the recommended one more thing drink lots of water you need it anyway and primal defense works best when you re well hydrated

0,i use this at work where i have infants up to toddlers we have to repeat the process times before we ever get an accurate reading the under the arm old traditional thermomaters are better
0,i admittedly have not completed the full book as it is thick however i do find that the narrative focuses on the reactive rather than the proactive tools needed for dfss for example almost all the examples given in section talk about an existing system or process and there doesn t seem to be any design examples and how the stats are used to solve the design problems i therefore think the book is more about six sigma than dfss barry
1,are they the best no do they impress people who havent hear them before yes to me thats the best compliment they are much more objective listeners with no preconcived notions all i ever hear is those speakers sound so good i love those cool little speakers etc i ve played everything from bach to dio and they sound very realistic subwoofer placement is key to having the proper bass level at they are a steal i paid in and listen to them everyday they still sound like they did when new
1,this version of the old favorite is an interactive delight engaging all the senses of reader and listener as they sing and play their way through the story each page offers endless possibilities to captivate the interest and attention of the youngest readers the progressive repetion of the song makes learning it fun and easy all the colorful digressions especially the silly commentaries on each page can lead to more fun games wonderfully illustrated sturdy pages

1,i have been enjoying this mix for quite some time it is a great gluten free way to satisfy chocolate cravings although the brownies can be a bit on the chewy side i would highly recommend making the cookie recipe shown on the bag it makes really great chocolate cookies definitely the best gluten free ones that i have come across in a mix so far i have even passed these off at holiday parties as regular chocolate cookies and my guests loved them
1,after all these years buying this wrangler product this by far has been the cheaper price that i ve ran across i love it
1,this is my first review but i just felt compelled to tell everyone about this terrific program i bought this game when my children were in kindergarten and second grade fritz and chester s program is so engaging there are rhymes and chants for each piece s moves as well as for some other strategy type moves for example a knight on the rim is ugly and dim what a great way to teach kids to keep their knights in play this program teaches kids how pieces move and some simple strategies i would recommend getting fritz and chester now since you are going to get it after your kids learn to play my boys both joined chess teams when they were in first and third grade their use of this computer game gave them the advantage to win several chess games in tournaments fritz and chester is also great and my boys now in third and sixth grade still play it
0,i purchased this to replace my husband s favorite keyfob from american eagle which was almost identical and lasted ten years incidentally this one fell apart after two months time for a trip to the local leathersmith
0,good lord but this was awful normally a e makes a mean costume drama but benedict arnold stank like rotting poultry the dialogue was stilted and incredibly unrealistic the battle scenes were rendered in clunky slo mo to cover up the lack of extras and the costumes appeared to have been rented from a cheap halloween shop with the exception of the military uniforms especially the continentals which were accurate aidan quinn chewed the scenery into pulp and used historical voice the lame semi british accent affected by actors in costume drama kelsey grammer was pretty darn good as washington but his lines were horrid horrid stuff ripped from the pages of a grade school history text worst of all were the simpering john andre and peggy arnold whose rose garden courtship scene was laughably bad in short don t even bother to rent this it s an hour and a half of your life that would be better spent cleaning the house or napping
0,this would be a nice printer if only i could get it to print not to mention when i turn it on it makes a god awful sound like some thing is jammed i ve tried over and over to try to print something i ve checked my options turned it on and off and still it sits there not printing if your looking for a portible printer you have other options and i suggest using them
1,this has been such a huge help with warming breastmilk formula and now baby food jars it heats the jars evenly and we have never had an issue with it i wish this was around years ago when we had our first child i think that this is a very good investment especially when you yourself have used a microwave and found that it doesn t heat anything evenly

0,i had heard of cannibal ferox for quite some time before watching it i heard that it was the most violent film ever made i enjoyed umberto lenzis eaten alive and thought this would be even better i was dead wrong cannibal ferox is a boring unpleasent film that definatly doesnt live up to its infamous reputation im not saying that cannibal ferox isnt gory or violent but i cant see how it was ever banned in countrys the few gore scenes are pretty effective but that dosnt make up for the films many many flaws if it was for giovanni lombardo radice one of my favorite italian horror actors starring in it cannibal ferox would only earn star

0,i only bought this one for the song by jerry orbach the first dvds were better
0,man oh man i think this is one of the worst books i ve ever read if i could give the thanatos syndrome negative stars i would seriously half way through i came to amazon to see how bad other people thought it was boy was i shocked to see that almost all of these reviews were positive i found the book bizarre unfocused and poorly written the volcabulary repeatedly seems misused the plot is not reasonable given the safeguards that us funding agencies have in place with regards to human experimentation the physics engineering psychology medical chemistry and biology are uninformed and unrealistic characters are introduced as though they will be important to the outcome only to have them dissipate and so on the characters don t even seem like real people for example the main character recognizes his cousin by seeing her ankles and only her ankles flashing below a curtain and yet he is apparently unaware of what degree of cousins they are how could someone know a person that well but still only have a vague idea of how they were related by blood or one of the more reliable male characters blows duck hunting calls at women he finds attractive as though he really thinks this will attract them c mon if the guys a nut and anyone who tries to seduce women by talking duck to them is nuts write him as a nut the whole way through don t make him the cornerstone of reliability at the book s climax the book s title isn t even explained for crying out loud thanatos means death in greek i believe but i could never understand what the author editors audience thought was dying i won t read this one again nor will i look for anything else by percy walker
0,this cartrige never printed any color than red even after cleaning many many times will never buy another cartrige from them paying twice the price for one that works is a better investment

1,we love cinna raisin crunch for breakfast the clusters are larger than average and hold up well in milk the cinnamon and raison flavor is right for me given few minutes to digest and it keeps me comfortably sated for hours if you prefer small bites or smooth textures in your breakfast cereal the usual cluster size in this cereal might not be right for you
1,i ordered the schwinn just a week ago it was eligible for free delivery and i took advantage of that offer it stated that it would take extra time for delivery however it arrived within a week though several have stated it was difficult to put together and took several hours my highly non mechanical wife and i had it together in about an hour and fifteen minutes the directions are a bit tricky but knowing that in advance from the other reviews helped once we were finished assembling it i got on it and started it up and began peddling i was sure it was not working correctly becuase there was absolutely no sound at all mechanical or otherwise i then reached over and increased the resistance and found out it was working correctly my wife and i both use it and love it i am pounds and it works great for me and based on several nights of extreme sweating during my workouts i don t expect to be for long super bike very pleased besides this is what my knee surgeon suggested for rehabilitating a knee i torn up last year and it s doing fine

1,james moseley was the stereotypical rich orphan trust fund kid inheriting millions while still in college he promptly left college and attached himself to a shady indiana jones style south american graverobber the graverobber wanted for some reason to do a book on the flying saucer myth then only a few years old moseley was sent crisscrossing the us to interview anyone and everyone who had made contributions to that myth in the period the book never materialized but moseley was left with extensive notes and the indelible and accurate impression that apart from a few people who had genuinely seen something in the sky they didn t recognize and would have been expected to if it were anything familiar the majority of the mythmakers were as my old grandma used to say crazy as a betsy bug over the years moseley kept his hand in meeting and interviewing anyone who came onto the scene in what he sometimes calls the field other times more accurately ufoology he edited and published a long series of saucer fanzines and newsletters and still publishes one to this day he met everyone and he shrewdly sized up everyone he organized many flying saucer conventions and seems to have attended most of the others here s his information packed account of about years in the field and there is no more accurate word picture anywhere in print in english i ve looked of the classic early contactees led by george adamski on to the abductees led by betty hill on to the growth of the crashed saucer myth from its humble beginnings with the scully hoax on to the full blown roswell hoax of and on to the supernatural abduction stories of the moseley was an eyewitness to the birth of many hoaxes a few of which he perpetrated himself highly recommended as a true insider s look at this nearly year old and seemingly immortal myth of things seen in the sky

1,i just picked up one of these for my motorola cell phone it has more than enough volume it comes with both a right and left ear adapter fits pretty good and i have medium sized ears its really light but because it clips to your ear and the earpiece fits slighly in your ear you can feel that you are wearing it it is very comfortable though if you make a lot of cell phone calls this is a very good ear headset
1,the taste is really great it is a bitter chocolate and tastes like one that is expensive high end to me mens is the name perhaps because the individual packs are so big when i first saw that i wondered if this was a musk candy like they have in australia nope these are for everyone it is an easy way to have an easy dose of chocolate i cannot eat a whole pack just one stick at a time share this with some friends would be fun to have these for a party

0,come one people windows vista is not only as unstable as it s windows predecesors with a very uglu memory management and a really unsecure and ineffective hard drive and files management i ve lost lots of very important files due to windows errors that shut down applications and even the pc itself so i decided my self to use linux or to die with microsoft and i m still alive as i told you vista is nothing more but a cheap copy of visual effects that linux users had from several years from now in facto right now i m using a linux version called sabayon and it is a million light years away from windows vista it s visual effects are simply incredible try searching beryl in youtube for you to know what i m talking aboyt i have not only windows but desktops incredible effects to minimize and maximize and a veeeery looooong list of features that you have to see it for yourself to beleave it i know that you might be concerned for several aspects at this points that wooried me in time when i was evaluating windows vs linux my documents that will happen with them nothing will happen in fact you ll ba able to open them and modify them as you please the oppenoffice suite is totally compatibble with your microsoft documents my programs well there are several options to run windows programs in linux as cedega wine etc etc etc si it means that you will be able to run most of the windows programs in linux is it hard to use no way it s as easy to use as windows you will only have to dedicate a few time may be a couple of hours to understand several conceps as the multiple destops the file system and the users and permission management that is the one of the most secures in the world microsoft windows cant s say that so if you don t beleave search google for sabayon and youtube for beryl and you will open your eyes so think about spending this bucks twice because sabayon and other versions as ubuntu kubuntu some versions of suse and other linux distributions are totaly free of charge you only have to download them and burn it to a cd or dvd whatever you like

1,so many books on the market about pregnancy focus on the medical aspect of what is growing in your wife s little belly and not how that little thing is changing your wife and life forever this book describes to a t how this life changing event reeks havoc on everyone involved in the process and it does it in a way that is bust a gut funny before i read this book i was like what the heck is wrong with my wife after reading this book i was more like ohhh i know why she just ripped my head off she hates the smell of carrots great book fast and fun read a must read for a new dad i ve bought it for every father to be and they in turn have done the same

0,i m more or less fine that they changed a murder with an object in a room to who ate the cake at what time with what beverage buying this for kids and all that its not as intuitive or intrinsicly interesting at least to me but hopefully it is to kids however they also changed the mechanics of the game from adult clue and not in a good way the room variable for example drops out its not relevant its who ait the cake at what time with what drink it just feels silly to set up the room pieces and move from room to room if the room is irrelevant the idea is probably to change the mechanics to make the game simpler well the problem with that is it was pretty simple in the first place and the change sort of makes it more complex in a way you need to remember the rooms where you already checked tokens now the sheet does list the rooms you could use that to check off the rooms where you checked tokens but since the rooms are not otherwise relevant its not intuitive to track the rooms where you checked tokens the game is also incredibly cheaply constructed for example the die does not have numbers on it you have to put number stickers on it and the board isn t flimsy flimsy would be an improvement anyway not recommended
0,i am so disappointed by another avent product that is just no good short term or long term these cups are not worth anything since they leak my son s cups have leaked on him on the floor in his diaper bag and in the car i don t understand why anyone if they say they have leaked would give this product anything but star mom s have enough too do running around cleaning after leaky unreliable products is not fun especially for the price of the avent magic cup
1,i discovered this in an airport bookshop and it is a great read on a flight i takes some of the most insightful trend study and boils it down so that anybody can get their arms around why design is the most important factor in your business today yes any bussiness this is my hyperbole tom is much better at stating the case but when a management guru like tom puts out a visualy interesting as well as well thought out book like this it is time to take notice read and use or be left in the dust
1,i heard the chairman dances and went right to amazon to order this this ia a lovely little gem of a cd and it is so pleasing to find john adams another great modern american composer i m also a fan of composers such as christopher rouse for example and joe leniado chira is my cousin modern composers are a precious resource that we should explore demand more of and nurture we afficianados would like to see symphony orchestras and ensembles giving more attention to the modern genre meanwhile john adams has impressed me with this disc the chairman dances is my favorite i can just see chairman mao doing a vigorous foxtrot to this and tricky dick feeling jealous this might be the music that opened china to the west

0,i bought this almost exactly years ago and i turned it on the other day and went to take a picture indoors that required a flash and the flash would not work it was set to automatic flash using the auto setting i thought there used to be flash settings auto forced flash and no flash but now there were only i took it outside on a sunny day and used the auto flash and the flash went off outside something is messed up and it has the light and dark confused thinking i hit something and changed a setting i reset it to the factory defaults and it still doesn t work it will probably be too expensive to get it fixed and it s weird but i just upgraded to a nikon i must have known this camera was about to die even when it worked half the time pictures came out blurry i either got fantastic crystal clear shots or blurry ones as if the auto focus missed maybe the camera was defective the entire time i had it no more canons for me
1,installing the software was a piece of cake using it is quite another matter the basic introductory instructions are easy enough but after that it seems to require a phd in mathematic astrophysics to get round all the available toggles tweaks and options first attempts the moon came out real nice but saturn was a white blob with no fine detail nothing like type of pics that the super whizzkids proudly display on the celestron site will go back to night school and one day you might see my fine efforts published as well oh was using it on a classic in good see ing conditions sorry celestron

0,i got talked into buying this at the fresh boutique in las vegas first it s very expensive forgivable if it were outstanding it s not even good the wand isn t well made and the product does clump on it and then it clumps eyelashes rather than lengthen them i have tried all week to make this purchase work out for the best but to no avail the worst part is at the end of the day if i happen to rub my eyes it smears racoon eyes i ve been using physicians formula and revlon with the primer both are exponentially better and i could have purchased eight of them for the cost of supernova on the positive side it washes off easily and completely with soap and water

1,if you love the unpredictable then catch is for you this game has plenty of social interaction and combines skill with luck in the pursuit of gold tokens just when i thought i was about to win the game my boyfriend landed on my game piece and stole all of my tokens boy that did not make me happy at all the key to this game is to use your blocker cubes wisely the cubes are used to either block an opponents way or safeguard your path to the money once you use the cubes you can only retrieve them by landing on a collect blocker square you can collect any blocker cube placed on the board including your opponent s cubes i made lots of money selling blocker cubes back to my opponents we were so addicted to this game that we played it all night long i highly recommend it but be prepared to either win big or lose your shirt
1,other than the republic of tea the people s green tea i really like yogi tea healing formula not only is it organic but the refreshing subtle taste of lemon grass with powerful antioxidant ingredient like grapeseed extract protect cells from free radical damage and also promotes healthy circulation should make one incorporate tea drinking in one s daily life other health benefits of green tea are for symptoms like headaches body aches and pains digestion depression immune enhancement detoxification as an energizer and to prolong life the only side effect is insomnia and i m suffering from it but i know my immune system is thanking me for cups of green tea each day

0,incredible does describe this movie incredibly bad this movie doesn t know what it wants to be at times one can see attempts to recreate and milk the genuine rage and drama of mississippi burning or the anger and impunity of ghosts of mississippi or a hybrid of those and bits and pieces of other movies of this genre at other times it looks like its just trying to draw from the sex appeal and cheesy interaction of of its main actors matthew mcconaughey and sandra bullock as a result this movie picks up the rear in that genre s list of movies for lack of originality and the scattered hodge podge statements it tries to make some of my favorite actors are wasted either by being given cliched dialogue over acting or being put there merely for their brand name with no script to support their presence if this script is considered a great adaptation of a great book then i have no interest in reading the book i m sure the idea and the premise looked good on paper but the direction doesn t guide the story with any coherence or identity of its own bullock is mere cheesecake and is unbelievable in her role proving she s only worthy of b grade miss congeniality type crud mcconaughey over acts so much as can be said for keifer sutherland and others that it can be said he balances out the under acting of patrick mcgoohan kevin spacey and donald sutherland samuel l jackson should be ashamed of himself of not only his worst performance ever but also easily his worst choice of movies to participate in even the extras in this movie are horrible enough can t be said about the terrible direction in this movie equating elongated facial shots with drama to a fault making sergio leone westerns look much more authentic by comparison this is not a powerful film it s a powerful attempt at using a big name cast a brand name book and a capable director to use material that they know would easily jerk the emotions of its audience and in doing that they resort to all the cliches of this genre scattering the story line in so many directions culminating in an over the top pleading hunk of cheese summation scene by mcconaughey that wouldn t hold water in any real court of justice maybe people claim greatness to this movie out of guilt or because they haven t seen quality comparisons and classics like mississippis burning that has both a great script and fabulous acting i don t know all i know is it tugs from so many hokey directions it takes the final scene to remind everyone how it started among the top of my most over rated movies
1,i requested this book for my college music class i saw many offers from b n and other book stores and i found amazon having the best price and received the book on time the book was in great condition and my fellow students were surprised when they heard the price and the shipping response i totally recommend this site and book for school the book was comprehensible and well illustrated
0,i made the mistake of selecting the bundle without reading the requirements closely the lens is for a variety of canon cameras but the adapter only works with the series my adapter arrived and it doesn t work with my camera kinda misleading and now i have to spend more to buy the correct adapter separately bummer also captain jack is correct about the vignetting this lens is sort of like a magnifying class that sits in front of the built in zoom lens if you zoom wide angle you see the horrible vignetting he mentioned if you stay zoomed in it works ok disappointing
1,i really liked this film before michael moore became a liberal celebrity he was a completely obscure magazine writer and filmmaker this film was a major underground hit at the time and it still is excellent today you really feel for the people who lose their jobs and you re infuriated by the callous indifference of roger smith and the management of general motors i really liked the segment where flint tries to reinvent itself as tourist mecca of the midwest it consisted of a horribly misguided attempt at opening up a hilton in downtown flint and opening up a theme park called auto world it justs smacks of desperation and stupidity it has make you laugh and grimace at the same time instead of giving these people really good jobs again they come up with this idiotic scheme which ended up in disaster both the hilton and auto world closed within a year moore in recent years has become a political celebrity in that politics has become quite the cottage industry in america it s not just moore doing it right wingers like hannity and coulter have been doing it too they all got books some of them got films some of them have radio shows a lot of them aren t really interested in changing anything as it might interfere with their livelihoods i don t know if moore is like that or not but this is still a potent darkly funny film about real class warfare and the dismantling of the working class in america

0,you know i actually enjoyed the first mummy it was funny the idea not often seen in modern films was good and the characters were each in their own way entertaining to watch why god why did they have to go and make a sequel i don t understand was it for the money i m not sure when exactly i began to hate this maybe it was somewhere in between the horrible and almost nonexistent plotline and the stupidity of the main characters making the same mistake again really you d think after the first time they accidentally woke a mummy from it s thousand year rest they d learn their lesson but oh no the first time wasn t enough and also the whole having a kid thing didn t seem to work the relationship between the characters wasn t the same anymore i hate it when they do that in movies make sequels and give the once cool main characters children nothing against it just felt wrong for this movie throughout most of this movie i felt stupid and i don t like for things to make me feel that way i also felt embarrassed to have actually paid for my tickets at the theater maybe it s just me i just didn t like it question of the day for american cinema what s the deal with being obsessed with sequels come on the first was good enough you know what the worst thing is i was actually looking forward to seeing this

1,i have had three of these logitech wireless controllers now they have all broken nearly seven months to the day i buy them the problem is the same every time the left analog stick breaks my girlfriend got me my first one in december christmas it lasted until about july i exchanged it at the store and the new one lasted until maybe february i exchanged it again and now my third one has just bit the dust in september i am not really a heavy gamer i play madden and ncaa sparingly i am very disappointed with this repeat problem i also notice the x button sticking issue that others refer to here i tried putting a little graphite in there to make it not stick that seemed to work for a while you really can t beat the convenience of wireless and every other aspect of the controller is great except the durability
1,this one of those products your girlfriend wonders why you are wasting your money on that turns out to make life so much easier it has allowed me to leave my ipod in my backpack on my way to work and go through security to get into work all without having to open my bag the remote has a velcro strap that i use to attach to the shoulder strap of my back pack i am able to start and stop tunes and change the volume without needing to pull the ipod out my only complaint was that the headphone jack should have a strap or something to help keep the headphones in all the way and the device could also have a strap as the device is made for active people it would be nice to know that everything would stay connected because when things do come undone you do have to open your bag and put it all back together and that defeats the point of having the air click
1,as an asian american i just want to say how well this movie is made i m not offended that this movie casted caucasian actors come on people this was in the and yes there are a few scenes that are not in the book but let s count how many hollywood movies taken from books that can t hold a candle to it s original masterpiece i love the movie misery but if you ve read the book the book outshines the movie by a landslide so yes the good earth movie has scenes that are different than the original book but still a very well made movie nonetheless particularly for the i saw it on tcm and am looking forward to getting the dvd

1,i am hopeful that katie holmes has not forsaken a promising acting career to become tabloid fodder and a stepford wife for her couch jumping husband to be it s not that she strikes me as all that brilliant but she does bring a relatable sense of humanity to her role as april burns a rebellious twenty something girl who has defiantly moved away from her family s upstate home to a tenement in manhattan s lower east side encouraged by her new boyfriend bobby who happens to be black she invites her estranged family to thanksgiving dinner where she will cook the whole meal in her tiny apartment there is a tragic undertone to the event since her angst driven mother is dying of breast cancer and this may be their last meal together directed and written by peter hedges who wrote the equally eccentric what s eating gilbert grape the story bounces back and forth between april s hazard ridden preparation of the meal and the burns family s chaotic journey to the city while the family trip will remind you somewhat of this year s little miss sunshine april s adventure consists mainly of meeting her motley neighbors all strangers at first to borrow a working stove for her turkey among others she runs into a friendly black couple an obsessive vegan and an elderly chinese couple whom she teaches the origins of the holiday on top of this is an odd racially driven storyline involving bobby s need to buy a suit while being pursued by some suspicious characters shot in digital video by tami reiker and running only eighty minutes the movie works toward an inevitable conclusion but hedges adds enough filmmaking idiosyncrasies to make it all seem more intriguing than it has any right to be among the supporting cast patricia clarkson stands out as april s mother joy bringing a steely resolve as she crumbles under the surface oliver platt is terrific as her put upon husband jim as are derek luke as bobby and allison pill as april s perfect little sister beth in little more than cameos which could have been excised sean hayes plays a neurotic neighbor with a new stove and a pampered dog while dru hill s sisqo plays bobby s friend latrell hedges provides a nice commentary track on the dvd which also includes a fifteen minute making of featurette

1,i ordered a case of sardines through amazon grocery last month and they didn t travel well the box arrived soaked in oil cans had popped open and seeped fishy oil all over the rest of my order upon inspection i could see that the design of the seals on the cans and the way that they were packed in their box made it a simple matter to pop the seals and any bump in transit could do it sardines are not returnable items imagine the mess of shipping them back amazon handled my complaint in excellent fashion regardless so i thought that i had better try it again i ordered a totally different kind same brand these sardines are not quite as tasty as the others but they are quite acceptable my cats like them and most essential they arrived in perfect condition that being said if you don t have amazon prime shipping you might consider getting it it pays for itself quite quickly and it is so darned convenient i live in the country and i work at home it s a pain to go to town to shop for groceries books music whatever amazon provides so many products i need amazon prime gets them to me quickly and usually painlessly those leaky sardines were my only problem among dozens of shipments amazon does a tremendous job i m one happy customer
1,tazo assorted black and green teas and herbal infusions includes one or two of each awake plain ordinary black tea a little bitter calm nice chamomile tea chai black tea an okay chai black tea with caffeine china green tips great green tea experience tazo s best no natural flavorings decaffeinated chai an okay chai black tea without caffeine earl grey black tea a disappointing perfumy intense black tea experience lotus decaf green tea with lotus flower one of my favorite tazo s passion herbal infusion hibiscus y intense caffeine free and luxurious wild sweet orange orange herbal tea some complex overtones perhaps zen mild relaxed green tea their ingredients include black tea green tea hibiscus flowers chamomile flowers lemongrass citric acid natural flavors spearmint leaves blackberry leaves cinnamon rooibos ginger root rose hips orange peel rose petals licorice root safflower black pepper lemon verbena leaves cardamom cloves peppermint leaves chicory sarsaparilla root lemon balm leaf star anise and red poppy flowers tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea tazo is owned by starbucks their web site is fun and quirky with a zen type focus definitely worth checking out it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea in general i m not a big fan of tea with flavorings added preferring the subtleness and authentic taste of the real thing overall the green teas seem good the herbal infusions are fine the black teas tend to turn bitter if you don t brew them very briefly even then they have bitter overtones tazo s assortment and tazo teas in general are fine better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings but not anywhere near as good as numi or aspen or other super premium teas made with only real ingredients and minus all of the flavorings i m more used to these high quality teas which tazo attempts to be but disappoints so overall tazo assorted gets a to a for this review i m rounding up since so many people seem to enjoy these teas and i m in the clear minority if your tea experience so far is drinking commercial teas of a lower quality no doubt tazo s teas will appeal to you as they are a great improvement they have a lot of variety and many interesting tea experiences if you don t enjoy tazo s teas though know that there are many many teas made with all real ingredients teas that cost only a fraction more that may be just the thing you were looking for
0,i bought these shoes for work to wear with my scrubs with socks i had to return them due to several issues the inside lining was too slippery i went for a brisk walk and my feet slid so much inside the shoe that they felt like they were on fire from friction tightening them did not work as the top of the shoe tore away the skin from the top of my foot leaving open sores even when walking at a normal pace the shoe kept sliding away from my heel when i stepped thirdly the sole of the shoe is very narrow it felt like walking in ice skates these were very cute and may be great for biking but not so great for everyday walking

1,i purchased the logitech mobile traveler a little over a year ago and have been extremely satisfied with the product but that s not to say that that the product is not without some flaws the reception clarity and battery life is quite good also my hearing isn t the greatest and love the fact that you can turn up the volume on this unit and don t have to strain to hear my one complaint about the product is that the loop piece that fits over the ear came after after the first month of use and often separates from the unit i ve gotten used to the drill of reattaching the loop prior putting it on but it s still very annoying at times even with this slight annoyance i would definitely buy this product agai

1,the metronome was everything i expected i wanted a metronome that was very loud so that it could be heard while playing in an ensemble and also one that had a volume control the sound is loud enough to be heard while playing ensemble and has good volume control it is not digital so one can easily switch tempos it is light enough to be easily carried around what i would have liked but did not expect is a tempo range that goes beyond unfortunately that seeems to be found only in digital

1,this was a christmas gift and the person loved it i was so happy i chose this website to purchase from
1,this is by far my favorite novel by forster and many rereadings have made it one of my favorite novels period in his first book forster shows a subtlety and lightness of touch which i at least feel that he lost as he got more self consciously philosophical in later books like howard s end and a passage to india he makes wonderful use of the italian settings and of italian art bringing them to vivid life undermining tourist cliches and weaving them gracefully into his main themes no other book i know balances romanticism and irony so perfectly
1,i bought this as a gift can t give much opinion she told me she loved them so i give it stars maybe that s not a fair review but it s breast pads they are always useful lo

0,look at my other reviews for other meat tenderizers that are made a lot better than this one and would be more worth your while i say it s flimsy because it s so skinny other ones have a wider base and offers more stability when you re stabbing into cuts of meat this smaller one also means you have to stab the meat a lot more i say just get the larger one that s more stable and takes less effort
0,my first and main complaint about this product is that it does not fit the ipod video the model is thicker than the and this case won t close around the ipod a secondary complaint is that though the case is sturdy and the foam lining will adequately protect a ipod from shocks there is no protection for the screen it s just a hole in the case like the hole for using the wheel and i just require more protection for my video ipod a third minor complaint is that there s a non removable knob on the back of the case for attaching the belt clip and the knob makes it uncomfortable in a shirt or pants pocket i m returning mine for all of these reasons and going with a clear hard plastic case that protects the screen too
0,the amount of time resulted in minimal results i was very disappointed
0,i love all other crocs styles but was very disappointed in the prima they are too slim and look odd and stretched out on me they also tend to slip off in the back as i walk yet the other styles fit me perfectly great idea but they should have worked on it more i can t wear these outside the house
1,twinings was founded in london england in and has a long and respected tradition of producing only the finest of teas english breakfast tea is a mixture of black teas from sri lanka which are blended to produce a smooth yet flavorful tea though often served during breakfast this tea tastes excellent all day long ok let s get down to brass tacks this is another great tea harder to over steep than some of the teas i have known it consistently produces a smooth and highly drinkable cup highly conventional in its taste english breakfast tea has a robust flavor that stands up well to lemon and milk which makes it a favorite among those who like to accessorize their tea plus i must say that this tea is wonderful iced add some lemon and sugar and you ve got the right tea for a hot afternoon and that s my review if you want an excellent all round tea hot or iced one that goes well with any food then english breakfast tea is for you if you want tea from a great tea producer them twinings is for you i highly recommend twinings english breakfast tea to all even those not normally into tea drinking or perhaps especially to those not normally into tea drinking
1,keeping this smoker up to temperature had been a chore until i invested in a heavy duty foot extension cord i bought a gage amp foot chord and i m now actually using the thermostat to back off the temperature i got this cord at lowes and it cost around dollars the manual says to use a foot or less cord with your smoker but it makes sense to use as short of a cord as you can also thanks for the tip from a previous reviewer about drilling a hole at the bottom of the smoker to allow the excess water to drain out got to go my ribs are almost done

0,this cocoa is gritty and has a bitter taste the dark chocolate mint is particularly bitter we don t care for the chocolate raspberry and chocolate vanilla flavors either the chocolate supreme flavor is sweeter and tastier than the other flavors but the child in our family still remarked that his cocoa tasted strange there are many non gourmet commercial mixes that are smoother more palatable and less expensive than this gourmet brand we won t buy this cocoa again this gift box selection is very handsomely packaged and looks great in holiday gift baskets but the cocoa fails the taste test
1,the direction was a grade acting top class and to top it you had eric and clint eastwood eric fleming was mindblowing one has yet to come across an actor with his confidence class and authority yes i agree we always tend to focus on clint forgetting that it was eric who was mile ahead of him todays generation has to watch these episodes in black and white to understand the beauty of this great western yes the fact is without rawhide there would be no clint eastwood

1,i really don t have much to say about this book holder not that it s just a book holder it s a nice one it does it s job it s a little too expensive for just a piece of plastic it s strong sturdy and it s big enough even for those massive heavy textbooks like the calculus ones although i would not recommend putting a dictionary or reference that s like thick even though it still may hold it s got little clamps at the bottom to prevent the page from flipping all over the place although those tend to fall off when you move them but that s no big deal just put them back on this book holder is kind of big and i would not put it on a small desk in the middle of a classroom but it s not too big you should be able to put it almost anywhere when studying on your own time
1,product came in good condition and was delicious it is expensive but very good
0,i agree with the person who said it s hard to chew and here is why disect your slim jim length ways there do you see the hair it is allegedly all made of cow hair gross that is the beef part i guess trans fat partially hydrogenated veg oil and some really long word chemicals to make mechanically separated beef and chicken what looks like hair taste good no thanks glad i did not buy my dog really likes it but then again she eats other dog s p p eewww

0,a friend of mine turned me on to spoon and at first i listened enthusicatically but then i got bored although spoon s songs may be catchy at times they are empty and deviod of any alterations the same simple drum beat mixed with the same simple guitar riff may be appealing for a minute or so but in the end i don t think i ve ever listened to an entire track if this is star music today our culture is severely lacking depth
0,reviewer alianore s opinion rather too indulgent of its subject is a very accurate portrayal of weir s work i will try to add something to that near perfect review note i listened to the unabridged audiobook of queen isabella hrs on cds the first half or so of this biography is mostly enjoyable loaded with period details the last third is the worst weir s fawning dedication to a glorious rehabilitation nay elevation of queen isabella to the role of long suffering much wronged highly deserving and late redeemed just queen of england this book is really subjective rhetorical biographal dramatization i do not consider it to adhere to an academic standard for objective history and analysis it is rhetoric because of the endless weasel words and expressions used copiously throughout some say it has been said many believe therefore we may assume it can be inferred this isn t just an attribute of her style it is her style comprehensively these expressions occur many hundreds of times commonly in conjunction with wier s subjective analyses that present her beloved isabella in the best possible light always giving her every benefit of the doubt and shifting negative interpretations onto other persons equally irksome is weir s double standard of historical psychological analysis she is always declaring for us the contents of isabella s thoughts remarkable gift she has for this many times weir reasonably states that modern psychological and socialogical interpretations of medieval history are inherently invalid or at least not meaningful but then moments later she will portray isabella s actions from a century point of view always telling the reader how isabella must have might have could have would have been thinking and feeling about one situation after another often presented in a positive way that is only supported by a present day psychosocial interpretation of year old history this isn t historical writing it is historical op ed with an obvious agenda i don t loathe this work it is enjoyable in many parts for its color characterizations and depth of detail the narrator of the audio book has a wonderful voice and good pacing but this is highly flawed in its editorial approach to historical biography other egregious examples of such hagiography include edmund morris rise of theodore roosevelt and theodore rex i could not complete either of those since morris is so obviously enthralled by his subject lovingly lionizing him in every sappy sentence yuck really if prefer more history when reading or listening to history and much much less editorial subjectivity retroactive psychology biased interpretation and rhetorical postulation the only way i could enjoy isabella by weir is to accept her bias up front and listen accordingly taking it with several pounds of salt as the above referenced reviewer advises

1,tazo s chai black tea is an enjoyable chai experience for the most part on the paper tea packet tazo writes a rich blend of teas and spices in the style of the hill dwellers of the himalayas on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of chai as cinnamon creamy sweet spice and medium bodied yet full flavored with the spicy kick of cinnamon ginger cardamom and black pepper tazo describes the aroma as sweet spice those are pretty accurate the black tea blend is a little bitter though even with minimal brewing it s a real trick to get it to brew long enough to get to experience the flavor from the spices without having the tea turn bitter the ingredients in chai are black teas ginger cinnamon black pepper cardamom cloves and star anise it is caffeinated tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea tazo is owned by starbucks their web site is fun and quirky with a zen type focus definitely worth checking out it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings but not as good as numi i m soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo chai gets only four stars

0,we bought this phone two years ago while the phone is pretty easy to use and has nice features i ve especially enjoyed the handsfree function on the handsets we ve found it to be extremely unreliable the problems we ve had are listed below very short battery life for the handsets the screen on one of our handsets blanked out after only several months of use the handsets go out of range when one takes them only a modest distance from the base even though we have the base in the middle of our house the handsets don t work at the ends and our house is not that big the handsets randomly become unregistered from the base and have to be reset this has only become a problem in the past month the issues we ve had with this phone have frustrated us so much that we are now shopping for a new phone usually we d expect such a purchase to last longer than two years

1,finally a big spacious nice looking toy box i looked for a long time for a toy box that could set out in our family room and still blend in to the rest of the decor but was bigger than the little wooden toy boxes that are out there the lid has finally improved from the old ones where the lid never stayed up the drawers on the bottom are small but hold a few things and don t take anything away from the big interior of the box it makes the box look more sofisticated love the new colors and design thanks little tikes
1,we were deperate for a charger the local stores seemed to be out of them and we got it overnight as requested unbelieveably fast thank you thank you thank you
1,awesome awesome awesome my hubby is an enginner and extremely picky about quality design and function about products and he loves this carrier i liked the price and my son loves to be at the same level as everyone else he tolerates being in this more than his stroller this was my first choice based on all the feedback thanks
0,all this air pump does is let out what little air may be in your tyres i can t think of anything else i have ever bought that was as completely useless as this it is a toy pretending to be an air pump the nonfunctional lever on the top mentioned by other reviewers indicates that it was designed as a toy i m just happy i was trying to put air in my tyres in the driveway not out on a trail in the past i have bought a number of bell products including motorcycle helmets i now shudder to think what might have happened if i had put one of them to the test
0,i haven t done this in awhile but i don t think i could review this piece any better than the other reviews i ve read about it it s pretty average however filled with nice bits of knowledge they didn t seem well researched in some areas here are the interesting parts of reviews from the other critics that i agree with they go into lengthy history lessons about the origins of the characters when two sentences would be enough john gallant biased against superheros sic christopher ritter i found this book to be tedious lacking in charm badly researched and wildy inaccurate in some areas c p halliday i picked up this book lawrance m bernabo their belief seems to be that donald duck was the best comic book ever m g bloedorn pretty boring bernardz a black hole is hypothesized lending a faint respectability to the premise behind green lantern s abilities peter vinton jr this book will not satisfy full on fans james n simpson gave it five stars a chance to laugh about the heroes i still love and that mean so much to me reviewer man there s a whole pages of this pooh poohing cranky old maid kind of stuff mark alfred they were even putting words into c darwin s mouth aaron spriggs mildly entertaining but not great reviewer when the man dean koontz in this case writing the introduction says he doesn t read comics i began to get worried ivan a wolfe i agree with an earlier poster reviewer almost every chapter tells you why the superhero is impossible plastic larry the authors give us a more plausible given what we know now origin for the hulk involving steroids and fluorescent gene modification j draper carlson this book is not mean spirited or nasty reviewer superman s powers break the laws of science ooh stop the presses interesting rick hunter the science of superheroes reviewer
0,this album is okay not their best a few songs are good other than that this album is fair purcahse it with your money intelligently
0,before purchasing this item please check with your safety services division in your state regarding the use of this product with carseats i purchased this item with the hopes of keeping my newborn warm but after i received it i was told by the director of safety services in our state that these items compromise the integrity of the belts in the carseats i also had a very hard time tightening the belts in the carseat because the openings for the belts did not line up well instead i returned it and purchased a kiddopotamus which is shearling lined and zips but fits over the carseat the bundle me item is perfect for strollers but not for use with a carseat while i want to keep my baby warm i think it is much more important that she be safe and secure in her seat
0,i hate to complain too much since this is a pretty cheap item but just to warn others i bought this because i wanted an ab bench it really doesn t suit that purpose too well since it was one incline position only for abs the other positions are just back support for working with dumbells the ab position is pretty weak and doesn t really work your abs as well as an abs only bench would have plus it is a bit uncomfortable and as the other reviewer said if you are anywhere near ft tall or over get something else combined with shipping this is a waste of almost bucks here while usable it really won t make an impact on your workouts i did a few sets of situps and really don t feel the tightness i would have if i used a real bench or even just sat on the floor for that matter if you re on a budget this may work if you put something under the front base to put it on a greater incline and or do situps holding weights and make sure you pad it with a blanket or something the position is just too awkard the fact that it s a multipurpose bench takes away from it as an effective ab bench real ab benches are one smooth incline not a perpendicular seat that bends down halfway which really stretches your back a bit too much in a direction it s not supposed to bend lol
1,i got this camera for my birthday last summer and it s great as much as i d love to have a canon powershot it s a bit out of my price range all the people who think that using the lcd screen runs out the batteries after pictures are lying to you i bought rechargable batteries from radioshack and i ve taken up to picture without the batteries needing to be changed this is a good camera with good quality in good lighting in dark or overcast situations it can look a bit grainy but that s easily photoshopped i recommend that when uploading plug it into the wall with a digital camera adapter because uploading sucks all battery power right out i recommend this for someone who hasn t owned a digital camera before or for someone that wants good quality at a not so crazy price
1,i have been enjoying these speakers outside by my pool for several months now and the quality of the sound is excellent particularly given the reasonable price i m sure you can get better performance but it will cost much more these speakers are a rare find in today s business world something that is actually a good deal
1,i bought my son this toy after reading all the bad reviews i agree that you cant reach all the buttons in the time allocated but he loves it and watches it move round the room i recommend this product for month olds
1,i got custom fit for this bra at nordstrom s and i am so happy that i purchased it among others that day i had lost pounds and was looking to update my image and had gone through about bra sizes on my way down hands down this was the best purchase even better than the i spent on the le mystere bra it is unbelievably comfortable and since i am a light it adds the perfect amount to make me a perfect c plus it gives me a bump and just the right amount of cleavage i can even wear it with many of my plunging tops and feel sexy without being over the top one thing to note is that it puts the breasts pretty close together and since i am and a size that works well for me as i am pretty small framed it took a bit to get used to them being so out there in front so if your breasts are set further apart then this might not be the right fit for you i love it so much that i now have this in all colors and of the bare color as i am very fair skinned
0,that s basically my two cents shallow characters bizarre story i am not the kind of person who usually watches romance films but i do like a good story and heard this was one it was not all of the characters were inverted ada and her daughter were utterly irritating george was disgusting from start to finish and sam neill s character supposedly the heartless jerk was actually the easiest to sympathize with how frustrating on a positive note michael nyman s score is unbelievable i love it
1,awesome shoe very comfortable on my feet even though it s high healed sneacker you really don t fee too much of height and none of it s negetive side affects i can actually run in this only thing is that it looks little too casual and your feet can get really hot wearing it i would recommend wearing thin sox i originaly brought dark brown in size normally wear or size shoe but had to return it to get way too big it s wider than i m used to even though i have wide feet offers plenty of toe room if they offer size it would have been perfect wearing my thick sox in winter unfortunetely there are no half sizes offered i wanted to buy black in also but is too big and smaller sizes tend to go fast and there are no more option for me now
0,i am a novice photographer so take this with a grain of salt i just bought this kit and it included no instructions and lots of components i suppose if you are accustomed to using these kits putting them together must seem self explanatory if you are new to these kits you will find it frustrating it is also frustrating to discover smith victor does not have a support site just references on photography they do not even provide a support or address keep all this in mind when considering something from this company
0,one good song of course the sound of silence and the studio version is far better than this one i am not a fan of the genre as you might expect
0,ok so most of the reviews i read for this film said how great it was well i for one think those opinions are based on the fact that young men and some women who enjoyed it mainly thrived on the sight of seeing angelina s breasts the acting was poor the script was stupid and the sets were lame i have seen some pretty bad movies in my time ie killer kondom but this one took the cake i would watch tromavision flicks over this one any day save your money if you want to see a good sci fi type movie watch ones that have been in the box office for more than a week
1,i after drooling over this watch for two years wishing i had one i finally got one and have had my advizor for two months now all i can say is that if i had known how cool this thing really was i would have shelled out the a long time ago each one of the features listed above does everything you could want the heart rate monitor has target zone settings average workout heart rate highest and lowest hear rate and more the altimeter tells your rate of ascent total vertical climb and stores all the data from recent workouts in memory the coolest feature is that it will store your heart rate altitude and rate of ascent decent at intervals from seconds to ten minutes so that after a workout you can scroll though and see how your heart rate was affected by altitude and acent rate i got completely geeky with this information after one workout and i typed it all into my computer so i could see what it looked like the only drawback to the advizor is that it gives you so much information it would be great if you could download it directly to a computer for analysis there is no pc link so any analysis has to be done on the watch or typed in by hand but other than that this gizmo is perfect no problems at all so far and i use the thing for two workouts a day i am a cross country ski racer and for a long time i had thought that this would be the perfect training aid for endurance athletes and now that i have tried it i know that it is
0,i rarely write reviews but quoting ebert who inexplicably liked this i hated this movie is editor the correct term to apply to joe klotz i give him credit for making a move under hours feeling like if you want to see a good slow paced movie watch l aaventura for a much better recent indie film about family life buy the squid and the wale if the director hoped to elicit the sterotypical slow pace of southern life he succeeded too well amy adams earned acclaim for playing yet another dumb but sweet southerner see forrest gump waterboy i guess her performance reaffirmed what hollywood thinks of the south notice all the glowing reviews come from people either from california or ny does the intelligent southerner exist in the minds of studio execs i assume that people like this movie because of some form of self deception or masochism i feel bad for the masochists but not the pretentious pseudo intellectuals who can conjure meaning from a film devoid of a plot or artistic merit rent this first and be thankful you will only lose hours of your life not
0,i picked this up because it s considered a classic and i knew it had been made into a movie i tend to think that if a book is made into a movie then the book must be pretty good not so with howard s end the plot in howard s end doesn t progress much outside of an early death and later marraige you have to have some interest in the characters but they just weren t very believeable none of characters convinced me that they could be people from the real world i kept waiting for someone to say anything that might border on being interesting but everyone babbles on and on about nothing of any substance the story is clearly dated and doesn t hold up well so many years later living in today s world it s hard to understand what attracted margaret to henry there definately is an audience for this book i m just not a part of it
0,isn t wearing your ancestry on your sleeve so blatantly and in such a predictable fashion just a century version of al jolson the problem with so many new traditionalist artists is that they lessen rather than deepen the understanding of the complexity and diversity of the celebrated cultural groups experience hippies and white liberals love it but where does that leave those that are living it far better capturing the latina experience are julietta venegas south of the border and east la s lysa flores north of the border
0,multi page story on asphalt who the f k cares skimpy and unfocused editorially the only thing they re consistent about is the use of short punchy blurbs in different fonts and sizes for example they had mari holden on the cover of a recent issue promising pro secrets what was her secret my parents told me to use a helmet and similar advice from other pros read cycleplus magazine from the uk for an in depth systematic approach to product review ride routes almost all in the uk and a variety of short relevant articles that inform without dumbing down the issue ok the two pages on yoga every month is a bit too much but they can get away with that becaause the magazine is so much fatter that bicycling
0,i bought this for my xbox and it doesn t work at all which is a good thing considering the other reviews i ve read here at least by not working it isn t damaging my xbox
1,there is actually science to support this serum and per a d magazine article several female dermatologists use it on their own skin you spread a few drops on your face and i use it on my neck and back of my hands as well in the morning before sunscreen or makeup it does not irritate my sensitive skin i have rosacea and seb derm or clog my pores a lot of expensive products are just hype but i think the science and the fact that so many dermatologists use it make this one worth the money
1,i have tried many teas in my life this by far has gone over the top with me i have tried different flavors all of which were very satisfying the one i liked best is tazo chai it has a spice flavor that just captivates the taste buds it may not be for every one but since i like the taste smell of exotic spices this does very well for me i will buy it keep it on hand as much as possible
0,my daughter and i have played all of the previous games we ve enjoyed them overall some of the games are fantastic challenging and fun this game was quite lame in comparison to the others the puzzles weren t really puzzling just boring tasks there were not many clues to find because there weren t many clues there was no real sense of detecting anything the game ended abruptly and was very short we did not use a walk through to solve the mystery in record time just experienced a lack of challenge we did like the newness of becoming frank and joe hardy occasionally the rest was pretty boring if you are looking for a nancy drew game try one of the others instead
1,i ve owned this smoker for years and have had great success turning out turkeys pulled pork ribs etc couple of tips that took me some time to work out cover the water pan with some heavy duty foil after filling it this ll prevent the liquid from boiling away too quickly you won t have to refill it during the smoking and it ll prevent the smoker from getting too wet inside when i left it uncovered i was getting steamed meat not smoked drill a hole in the bottom of the unit and get a drip pan underneath it this ll allow any condensation to drip out rather than collecting in the bottom of the smoker and promoting rust get some heavy duty foil beneath the heater element makes cleanup much easier and gets the heat reflected up to the food have fun
1,these roller blades are great they weren t to expensive and they are sooo comfortable they are fast and they are great to learn on and now i m doing to krooked grind to out i recomened to everybody that they should buy these and you will get total satisfaction the only bad thing about these blades are that they are a little ugly but they still work really well
0,absolute waste of money this is not a pillow as advertised in my opinion falsely but a flat mat which when filled with water is a very heavy weight and it is not possible to sleep on this you could use it to wipe your feet on but thats all an extremely disappointed customer who suffers from overheating badly in bed and thought this was a great solution now out of pocket and no better off
0,i m very unhappy with these lights i placed them along the planter in my patio a couple feet away from the fence in full sun but they didn t work at all we set them out in the middle of the patio and now five of them do work for a little while but they don t accomplish their purpose in that area they re also in the way one of them has never worked at all i gave them the old college try for a month or so but now it s too late to return them so i m stuck with them and out my money
1,having an m a in english literature as well as a b a in literature and history anytime a movie is both historical and literary well i get a bit excited to say the least i don t wish to give the impression that this movie is based on absolute and authentic history because it s not but the writers directors producers set it against a historical backdrop nonetheless on that note this is yet another stellar title from noneother than ridley scott with that being said i enjoyed tristan and isolde almost as much as gladiator and a bit more than kingdom of heaven all of these by the way are ridley scott films notice the historical adaptations here while it may be true that the story of tristan and isolde was inspirational to shakespeare s romeo and juliet as well as possibly fueling much of the intrigue of the arthurian legend this movie is not exclusively for the high browed college types no sir good ol red blooded men and women will certainly be drawn into both the action as well as the romance in this movie this is by no means a chick flick since there is present a large degree of bloodshed and overall suspense on the other hand it s not the typical hack and slash macho film because at its core is a very dynamic love story in short it should please both sexes simultaneously aside from james franco tristan i was rather unfamiliar with most of the cast sophia myles isolde is for the most part a newcomer to american audiences despite a rather large resume in mostly british films i suspect this film will provide her the recognition she certainly deserves on this side of the atlantic while many of the other characters were convincing in their roles no other character was more believable in his villainy than that of the arrogant irish king who just so happens to be isolde s father in short this is one of the best movies i ve seen in awhile on some levels it reminds me of king arthur just as king arthur attempted to provide a plausible history of the legendary arthur guinevere and lancelot so too does ridley scott by placing the action a few years after the establishment of the angle and saxon kingdoms in england if you ll recall in king arthur arthur helps hold back the onslaught of the invading saxons just as the roman legions were exiting britannia historians will point out that there is no evidence of saxons in england until several decades after the roman withdrawal but oh well it made for a good story here we witness the celtic britons as they are exploited by the irish across sea what the irish doing the exploiting and not the other way around well tristan and isolde holds true to history in this aspect namely that the celtic britons of england were indeed pushed to the easternmost shores of the island after the coming of the anglo saxons this would of course have placed them in what is now wales and cornwall and this is exactly where the movie is set let s not forget the story of saint patrick remember he was actually a romanized briton who was captured and served as a slave in ireland before escaping and ultimately returning to ireland to convert the populace to christianity it s interesting to note that in the movie christianity is a fairly new fangled religion in ireland so no doubt ridley scott intended this to remind us of the time period at hand i particulary liked king arthur and kingdom of heaven despite the lukewarm reception they received from the critics critically speaking tristan and isolde has been a bit of a mixed bag as well but who really bases their decision to watch a movie on the arrogant views of movie critics rent it first if you must but i suspect this one will be a keeper in your dvd library
0,this film is visually stunning and impressive and has talented and credible actors unfortunately there is barely a story with a lot of poorly developed characters who are trained brainwashed and instructed in the ways of death and inhumanity the settings and group sermons from nazi officials are striking and convincing but there is nothing that ties it all together our hero fails to strike the killer blow and is stripped literally and figuratively of all status and walks away the end i m forced to comment that this is marketed as a gay film and i was surprised by how un gay it was in fact the two boy friends work together at one point to spy on a lady in a state of undress it s more about a childhood relationship in the midst of chaos than anything else i have issues with some of the pacing as well i found myself pressing the fast forward button several times and didn t really seem to miss much not a good sign so for what it is it s okay certainly not a masterpiece and certainly not something to run out and buy
1,i bought some of this after seeing it featured on food finds at first i thought it would be a good alternative to cranberry sauce at thanksgiving but it s even better than that it s not tart like regular cranberry even with all the different tart fruits in the ingredients it s surprisingly smooth and surprisingly good i ve tried it on ice cream with cheese and crackers and have even put it on barbequed pork so far it s been fabulous on everything i just keep trying to find more things to try it on will definitely be buying this one again
1,the black of this is the same as on my camera and with all the parts together this is one professional looking set up i am not sure if this hood cuts down on glare reflection as i have not used it on a sunny day but i don t see why it shouldn t and as cheap as this little product is it is pretty much a must have with this camera is one last side note should you alreay own a extra lens or two and they happen to be metal be very carful about screwing them into this plastic adaptor i made that mistake and had to put the whole thing in the fridge for an hour so the metal would shrink and i could get the pieces apart
0,a good friend of mine insisted i d read this book because she knows i love exploring the spiritual aspects of life in the end i was very disappointed not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book but michael crichton s whole attitude he would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences only to revert back to his arrogant narrow minded attitude once again for the next chapter how can anyone claim they ve learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in sadly this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth i have no desire to read any more of his books
1,this cd has so much going on and going for it it s one of the number one releases this year for jazz fans lee ritenour is one of those guitarists who sculpted much of the west coast evolutions in jazz during the s and you can hear why people followed his flavor on these tracks he s never sounded better and the musicians who contributed with him on this cd are tight and magnificent in their own right blue in green is one of my favorite jazz compositions by miles davis and ernie watts on tenor sax more than does it justice ocean ave is as breezy and beachy as i think it s meant to be my favorite tracks are easily she walks this earth ivan lins vocals are bossa nova beautiful blue in green and predictably for me papa was a rolling stone with powerful crystal clear unique trumpet by chris botti and soulful rhythmic vocals by kenya hathaway and grady harrell i went looking for that track because i am transfixed by chris botti s trumpet and what i found was a remarkable cd in its entirety happy me
1,bought this player for my girlfriend for christmas she loves it it is small and easy to use the headphones could be better though the process of puting songs onto the player is simple and fast considering you cannot hear the music without headphones and the headphones that come with it are not very good it only gets a out of
0,dan fogelberg is an extremely talented songwriter and performer unfortunately the songs that get the most radio play are his weaker efforts songs that seem formulaic and safe his best songs are the lesser known works listeners have to buy the albums in order to hear them they ll never make it to the pop airwaves serious fogelberg fans will be disappointed by this greatest hits cd greatest hits is not synonymous with greatest music quot
1,a friend loaned me her cd and i absolutely loved it but i could not purchase it anywhere my daughter suggested i contact you results results thank you a most outstanding seasonal soft listening cd
1,this is a good teleconverter that added to the camera s native zoom it adds a great degree of stability to the camera for taking those critical shots of course when the digital zoom is used it is very sensitive to shake and movement overall a good addition especially for the birds and nature shots
1,i am a biochemist by education and was a teaching in physiology in a university as such i am very knowledgeable about chemistry and the human body in general i really like neutragena products and this product is certainly very high quality for most people i think it offers great protection but not the best protection for people who need to be very conscious of sun exposure and the possibility of skin cancer according to my dermatologist recent studies have shown that spf wipes off after a few hours and doesn t offer adequate protection after that time this is partly due to most people not using enough in other words they underestimate how much they need to apply to get that level of protection for this reason neutrogena spf or is better also the neutrogena ultra sheer products have been updated to include a technology called helioplex most dermatologists that i know feel that this makes a difference in effectiveness and for some people this is going to be very important i have used both this product and the higher spf helioplex formulations in practice i have found both adequate for my needs what i particularly like is that you don t even know you have the product on it has virtually no scent and it really is so sheer you can t even notice it both of these products stay on a long time and are good for all day use but my understanding is that the helioplex formulation is even better further it feels exactly the same on the skin the only drawback is it s a bit more expensive this is also a good product because it protects against both uva and uvb rays both are implicated in skin cancer and it s important to protect yourself against both if you are looking for an everyday sunscreen this might be the one however if you want the very best protection try the neutrogena helioplex spf this will give you the most peace of mind
1,these boots are warm and comfortable like my sheepskin slippers my feet are toasty even when it s freezing outside they have a thicker sole than some other styles which makes this boot great for walking in snow and ice i love the warm brown of the chestnut they look great at off the price was great too
1,great movie and the movie a family can set and enjoy and not worry about the next word or scene may hold
0,i bought this table set for my son because it was inexpensive and i did not want to spend a lot of money for something that was sure to get paint and glue all over it from day one it was a big dissapointment the chairs are very easily tipped over he can not even sit on the chair if i am not holding it or the chair would fall over the tabe is not made well as it is easy for things to slide off the surface it seems to be slightly raised in the middle i am now online shopping for a new one so instead of paying dollars the first time around i am now spending the dollars already spend and an additional for the new tabl
0,as a practicing photographer and not a collector i ve been very disappointed with b w on the few occasions it s crossed my desk i ve never had a subscription so i m basing this on just the few issues i ve seen quality wise the last issue i received was poorly printed it contained streaks through the images and rampant misregistration among other things the paper is unimpressive as is the printing itself the line screen looks quite course in a full colour magazine it would be fine but for one in which everything is in monochrome i would expect that they would print stochastically or at a higher resolution etc in terms of content every time i ve seen this magazine it has been filled with work which is typically very well executed technically but un innovative and un inspirational at least to me most of it is of the hobbyist dedicated amateur variety with few capital a artists or professionals stereotypical nature and bodyscape style photos seem to dominate with few examples of conceptual thematic or high art work and i ve never seen any fashion or photo journalism either we could use more non technical photography magazines but b w caters to an audience obsessed with traditionalism and the imitation of old masters such as cartier bresson and ansel adams ps reading body copy set in futura with tight leading is a real pain
1,this book has opened up a whole new world for me my husband and my son what a great idea to link reading and play each night we choose a book to read and an activity to go along with it i highly recommed read it play it with babies and toddlers to anyone who has a child
1,not a bad product but has very little bass response and the weather channel does not come in very well no matter where the antenna is positione
0,the packaging the bracelet came in was quite upscale nice black leather case much nicer than the bracelet deserved however the bracelet itself is light weight and the heart attached is ridiculously cheap it is not rounded as pictured but flat like a dog tag only much smaller i m using mine as a base for a charm bracelet but i would never wear it by itself i understand though that it is not an expensive bracelet and the weight is probably about right for silver at that price
0,gosh i would really like to review this adapter but amazon has put my order on indefinate hold as thier supplier is unable to get any more but wait what s that blurb on the product page availability ususally ships within hours and want it delivered tomorrow order it in the next hours and minutes and choose one day shipping at checkout see details so they can t deliver it yet they still list it as available for delivery tomorrow don t order from amazon
1,i love this watch it s perfect for swim workouts and aquathlon races takes splits can do intervals etc i use a different product with a heartrate monitor for my runs but can t use it for my swims since heartrate monitors can t transmit under water and also the unit itself is not waterproof this timex has an audible chime under water and it s easy to set the various functions it stores your workout splits so you can recall them later when logging your workout i also love the alarms my schedule is different every day so i use the alarms to remind me when to leave work for school when to leave to pick up my son etc i had lost my first watch same model but never found another watch that had all the features i wanted for a reasonable price this is my second one
1,i m way over the age of but i just loved this book interesting story and characters that i enjoyed spending time with
1,else if michigan was on vinyl i would have worn it out by now illinois was my first venture into the sound world of sufjan stevens and no doubt it his most impressive outing to date however the subtle spendour of the earlier michigan has ousted it as my favourite perhaps less eclectic and entertaining than illinois but more soulful and beautiful ultimately it s the one i d take to the proverbial desert island there s not a single track in this minute cd that i d want to skip or drop from my playlist but highlights for me are romulus gentle and heartbreaking sleeping bear musically gorgeous and vito s ordination song like being gently hugged p s so often the bonus tracks on a cd can seem superfluous and substandard but the extras on my cd marching band and pickerel lake are both excellent
1,i just bought this one for the top of the stairs and a pressure mounted gate for the bottom of the stairs my first impressions is that a pressure mounted gate is fine for the bottom of stairs however gates which attach to walls with screws are way more sturdy than even the best pressure mounted alternative we considered this model and the evenflo top of stair gate after inspecting both gates in the store we opted for this one because the wood spindles on the evenflo seemeed less sturdy and potentially prone to breaking if one of the spindles breaks you have to replace the entire unit also why take the chance with safety anyway here are a few things to consider when installing this item i took the advice of others and only used the template for the swing side hardware only this is a must do it would be a wall damaging crapshoot to try to get both sides lined up exactly right using templates on both sides of the wall unless you are screwing the hardward into a banister and don t want to damage them by having screws go all the way through use longer screws than the dinky to screws that are provided in the kit i went with screws for additional strength installation isn t that big of a deal just take your time to avoid silly mistakes that result in extra holes in your walls i found the picture based instructions at the back of the booklet far more useful than the word based instructions at the front of the booklet it wasn t a five minute job but it was not hard at all i ll be back in a few months to post my thoughts on the gate after it has had some wear and tear from our months old son and our dog
1,i tried betty lou s spirulina ginseng balls because i read the nutrition information and you get of your daily requirement for vitamin a in one serving at this point in my quest to eat healthier i ve read lots and lots of nutrition labels finding this much vitamin a in a snack is rare finding something deep green in color that actually tastes pretty good is rare if you re looking for a yummy sugery snack this is not for you if you are looking for a healthier snack to replace grabbing for that cookie this snack is worth checking out
0,an internet search found complaints about not receiving rebates why would they give you something for nothing i have had several rebate problems and most of them involved free items or insanely cheap items this free software could cost you if the company decides they don t want to pay
1,the picture for this pendant is deceiving it is a lot smaller than it appears i know the dimensions were given but the picture gives one the impression that it is bigger than it really is nevertheless my wife likes it very much and that s good enough for me the price was right at so overall i think it was a good buy
0,daylight savings time in the us has changed these watches continue to use the old daylight savings time rules while you may not mind having to manualy set the watch for a few weeks twice a year it kind of defeats the whole purpose
1,twinings blend of ceylon and indian tea produces that more traditional hearty aroma and pungent flavor in non tea terms that means that it has the ideal combination of briskness brightness strength and flavor normally i wouldn t attribute these things to a canned tea that has been processed and sat in warehouses trucks and stores for long periods of time yet twinings seems to hold up well i love tea would drink if possible and more often than not there are only three brands that sit on my shelf in any consistent manner and twinings is definetly one of them
1,i am writing this review primarily to let people know what to expect from this product since amazon toys r us don t seem to have a clue even the image was provided by a thoughtful customer i bought this in store at toys r us because sizing information was not available online except for the size of the box for some bizarre reason and i didn t want to take a chance with getting the wrong size so let me share that information with you this helmet is suitable for head sizes from to i think overall that this is a great set but i marked it down a point because it does not include elbow protection from my own experience learning to skate or even snowboard i can say that i would generally fall onto my knees or the heels of my hands so knee pads and wrist guards would be perfect for me but with a young child who knows this is for my neice i am not a parent and whilst i am generally happy with the set as it is i think it would be nice to include the elbow protection which is afterall available in other sets but does not appear to be available separately to make a complete safety package perhaps we are supposed to buy and extra set so we have the elbow pads and two sets of knee pads or perhaps i am a touch too cynical
1,great value sturdy hangers low price didn t mean cheap it meant affordable compares to others in the pricerange of for the set i would have paid less than for one instead of three i m not compaining this is one for the consumers thanks amazon
1,i ve said it before i ll say it again i m a white gal who likes to throw her ample weight around i find these cupcakes to second only to the mighty ding dong when it comes to hostess treats the chocolate cake is great and the frosting is absolutely delectable avoid the bastardization that is the golden hostess cupcake
0,the technology on here is great but the storyline is going no where what s the point is creepy as usual and big boi s acting is horrible when he s paired against terrence howard they only got screens nationwide for this movie but it doesn t matter screens or screens the bottom line is that this movie sucks
1,kind of difficult to place without getting some kind of stuff between the screen and the protector does what it is supposed to do
1,fast shipping great product and easy return policy had to return item because i purchased the wrong one which was no problem at all
1,i just bought this fountain pen because i missed writing with one since elementary school when we were required to use them it is quite nice for the price and as all foutain pens an instant handwriting enhancer
1,this phone is great it was my first phone ever and when it came time to get a new one i just couldnt find a phone as great as this one so if your looking for a phone that will be able to handle almost anything cause let me tell you mine went through world war and its still working like new and not to mention the camera i noticed on this one was much better than any of the other phones that tryed out and my phone did get a few scrathces but that will happen in time if you dont use a case some of the ringtones on it sometimes arent really loud enough even with the volume on high but there are a few that are just perfect i was and still am real pleased with this phone and it is an excellent phone for anyone
1,i love playing this game the icewind dale ii is edition rules and the graphics are great
0,i misunderstood the dimensions listed x x inches and thought it would be large enough for my mother to see and handle it isn t apparently the dimensions include the packaging she loves wheel of fortune on tv and i thought this game would be terrific therapy for her hands very disappointing i ll be returning it unopened
1,this gun was great when i got it i immediatly pulled it out and went to play with it good for kids just starting out with bb guns also it isn t that powerful overall this gun is great and i cant beleive it is
0,i don t usually make a point to watch films this bad predictable plot laughable dialog horrible music soundtrack etc but when i saw that my all time favorite actor jeremy brett had a brief but memorable role in shameless originally titled mad dogs and englishmen i couldn t resist it s a bizarre experience to witness an actor who so perfectly embodied the iconic sherlock holmes in the beloved granada tv series appear in such an odd role of a drug supplying sugar daddy it s even odder to see a glimpse of him in a modern day sexual scene with a young woman regardless as usual he stole the movie even if he was only barely in it i only wished the director has used brett to his fullest talents instead of as an aside eccentric a young elizabeth hurley makes a mediocre attempt to portray a bored little rich girl with drug problems and c thomas howell does his best to seem sexy in a grunge biker kind of way but brett s booming voice subtle expressions and dynamic presence wakes you up for just long enough to pay attention to his character once he disappears from the screen you realize all too soon that the rest of the film is worthless it takes a great actor to lift up a role from the muck and i m sorry to see that this was brett s only chance to do a modern day storyline from his usual historic epics before he passed away he briefly commented in an interview why he did the role and soon realized the film was a disaster on mad dogs and englishmen i was mad to do it but i wanted to show the world that i was still alive and i could do other things apart from sherlock holmes i hope they don t release it
0,i tried this thermometer on my baby and then even on myself when i couldn t get a consistent reading the temperatures were so varied it was completely useless very disappointed i returned it without even the box
0,if you expect this to play music by itself you will be dissapointed basically each foot is a sqeeze horn it s not bad a plush but as a musical toy it s horrible
1,i find the item in perfect shape and operates effectively thank you so much bimvik
0,there are so many different sites that all tell you that they have the best absorbed coenzyme manufactured it s hard to know who is really telling the absolute truth or just propagandizing a product for quick sale we are born with extremely high levels of coenzyme and then it gets slowly used up as the years pass even if we actually eat the foods that resupply our bodies and who purposefully eats these foods for the coenzyme content the mitochondria in every single cell in our body needs this coenzyme for production of energy by the time we are over our levels have dropped significantly and our energy levels have dropped with it i must admit that this nature s made product does not seem to increase my energy level like other company s coenzyme does so from my own reaction to this product i do not recommend this particular coenzyme there are several other companies that make excellent effective products like dr whitaker s and dr sinatra s and dr william s but not this nature made product
1,i love the garrick sandal it was exactly what i expected as seen in the stores delivery and service was excellent
0,i ordered the product thinking that it should be good for the price but it doesnot keep the warm water warm for mintues the pedicure set is hard to use the bubbles are not effective i guess cheap is expensive
1,we got this item for our yr old she loves it i gave it four stars only because the top light doesn t work good enough and we need to bring in our own bright light and the under light is so bright that is hurts our eyes after a while we love how it connects to our computer we can see it together and even take digital pictures some of the parts are made out of plastic and i worry about the lasting quality it should be handled gently in order to last a long time pretty good imagery once you get it in focus as it is sensitive not bad
0,i don t know what the heck is going on with your subscription service i bought this magazine for my nephew back on july and he still hasn t recieved an issue i am extremely disappointed with your service it should not take this long to get a magazine
0,i thought i was getting a terrific deal on ink tanks they look exactly the same as those that came with the printer and those that are packaged individually but when i later bought a one off replacement not custom tank i noticed the ink level bar on the printer lcd was not only full but also longer than the other bars if the custom tanks hold only about half the ink this isn t the bargin it appears
1,my high school is making us buy these calculators and i want to say it is definately worth the price this thing works wonders and it will do anything math realated that you want to do i would strongly encourage you to buy this calculator it also comes with a great unit converter and the periodic table so it s great for students like myself to use buy this calculator you can also hook it up to your computer through a usb cable so you can view your screen that is on the calculator on your computer monitor and you can back up and restore your ram memory
1,private eye philip marlowe is asked for help to get to mexico by terry lennox marlowe likes lennox and agrees to help him but later lennox commits suicide in the small mexican town of otatoclan but why was lennox driven to such extremes later on marlowe is asked for his assistance in keeping the alcoholic writer roger wade on the staight and narrow this is not really marlowe s line of work but he becomes entangled in the case especially as connections with lennox begin slowly to emerge this is a longer more ambitious novel by chandler albeit displaying the same cynical tough edge as the other marlowe novels i ve read the greater length allows chandler more space for character development and reflection the danger of this is that the novel could have felt over extended but for me it didn t the ending did not come as a total surprise but as with every other chandler novel i ve read enjoyment of the journey rather than satisfaction at the quality of the destination is the important thing g rodger
1,i saw these here and ordered two pair to get the free shipping deal i should get a deal where i get a cut of the customers i send them because every day i have my customers several each day ask me what s going on with my glasses and where did i get them i used to go through several pair of reading glasses a month now i have had these two pair for gosh it s got to be close to a year now they don t scratch break get lost they re always right there i don t know how i did with out them for so long get a couple of pairs you ll love them oh one thing when the ladies try them on thier hair doesn t always set right with the wrap around thingy but i don t know that this can t be overcome so something to consider
0,years ago a group of children playing accidently kill one of their friends and decide to keep a secret years later when they re all in high school the girls twin brother exacts bloody revenge against them your typical horror film not very notable other than leslie nielsen and jamie lee curtis this is one prom better left unattended
0,i wonder if they ll continue this to focus on the kid the father and the other people who really cares to be honest such trash
1,i have my own ati primium tv tuner card so i tried the trial version on this software but i realized that once one software is using a tv tuner card it is difficulty to use the same device for other applications so i purchased the full version of my iptv which came with a usb external device so i can also use it on my laptop notebook i like this a lot this company boasts the feature to watch tv away from home but i was very happy that i can watch tv from any computer at home as long as i have my iptv in one of my desktop or stationary pc i would recommend this to folks who wathc tv on their pc or want to watch on pc like other techy guys out there i guess this turns your lcd monitor into a lcd tv
0,i recently purchased this product to ease my bach aches when bathing my year old son it definetly relieved some of that uncomfortableness however the problem i encountered with this product is the top portion elbow pad adhering to the side of the tub it does not always suction properly and often times would fall off the edge of the tub the other day my son tried putting it back and suctioning it to the side of the tub there was a little moisture on the edge of the tub the top slipped and he slammed his mouth onto the top of the tub he sustained a severly cut lip and jammed his top front teeth there was blood everywhere his teeth are loose now but should be okay his lip is healing up but he was in pain for quite a while i would like other parents to be aware of this potential accident in hopes that their child will not be injured
0,the cord design of these is terrible you ll have about inches from the attachment point to your left ear and about inches from your right ear to your attachment point this is especially agravating for right handed individual pshh hardly any of those why is this an issue because it really is only not awkward if you hold your player or whatever in your left hand as the normal cord is too short i always use the extra extended cable which makes the entire cable maybe a foot too big for ordinary use the sound is good for the price doesn t compare to my normal set of headphones but sporadically i feel like they are hurting my ears not in a physical sense i have a feeling this has to do with either improper wma encoding or more than likely as i ve never had this before with other headphones improper sound design of the speakers question is though would i spend the amazon asks for them yes as they are definately the best in that price range but don t go to best buy or circuit city to get them as the price will be too high i expected more from sony
0,every time i use the product out of times i receive an error and have to try it agai
0,i watched this with some trepidation and i have to say it was both better and worse than i thought it would be it was better because it remained fairly true to the original in terms of retaining the multiple conflicting story lines and the ambiguous ending it was worse because the attempts at erotica were less entertaining than the original and i found stone s lampshade hairstyle oddly distracting a couple of things kept me viewing this dvd one was the london setting which gave me an opportunity to see what time has done to one of my old home towns the other was sharon stone s rather plucky performance and the presence of charlotte rampling who has aged into a different kind of beauty morrisey doesn t even come close to filling michael douglas s shoes and it s hard to feel sorry for him at the end as with the first movie you are left with the feeling that there was a better film waiting to be made the basic idea of a psychotic novelist who feels compelled to act out her fantasies in real life is an intriguing one however both movies were quick to abandon hitchcockian understatement for speeding cars and gratuitous sex there s nothing wrong with either of these things but here they just get in the way
1,this is the way to beat the airline travel restrictions for carrying liquids actually i liked everything about this product certainly easy to use and certainly pleased with the performance no more mini bottles of shampoo for me
0,i agree with what others have said about the re designed sport knit pants i had been happily buying the tapered leg cotton sport knit pants for at least a dozen years when lands end decided to start making them with a wide straight leg instead presumably because some customers had requested the newer look maybe i m wrong but i think most people who are looking for the latest fashion aren t going to suddenly start shopping at lands end and it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style the company should make a new additional product in that style rather than re design a product which according to lands end s own descriptions was a perennial customer favorite i returned the new pants and this formerly loyal lands end customer is now shopping elsewhere
0,the shelves are not sturdy and the pockets are very small don t waste your money it s not worth it
0,i actually went through three of these phones each one that i had would just turn off in the middle of a call not just drop the call i mean the phone shuts off then i would try and start it again no go so i had to take the battery out of the phone put it all back together and then restart it half of the time it would start and say invalid battery and i would start the entire process over again i complained so much to tmobile that they exchanged it for a motorola which has all the same features except better reception and an player i wouldnt reccommend this phone to anyone p s my husband has the silver one and the same thing happend to his

0,after really enjoying the amici forever album i went shopping for another amici album and found this one there really is no comparison between the two i ve tried listening to it several times to see if i m missing something but somehow the selections and arrangements seem more appropriate for the lawrence welk generation than anyone interested in a spicy little opera troupe i was very disappointed

1,we used this for my newborn daughter up until months when her digestive system finally started to mature enough to not have gas frequently as a previous reviewer stated sometimes it works sometimes not so i combined it with the recommended dosage for infant gas drops and that would do the trick i found little tummy s brand at babies r us which is less expensive and is the same thing later after months and trying new foods there has been a couple of occasions when you could tell something didn t agree with her i gave her the recommended dosage for her age and she d clearly feel better
1,i tried this about two months ago and really loved it i love the crunch and natural sweetness i also made corn chowder with their corn product i recommend this for any one who loves healthy natural snacks
0,bayer is a name brand aspirin any brand name drug will cost at least double of that of the equivalent generic aspirin i give this a one star rating not because it is a poor product rather because it is so expensive the dosage is mg taken to thin the blood to prevent heart attacks and strokes generally taken by older individuals who perhaps have arteriosclerosis have had a heart attack or stroke aspirin is a wonder drug the very first analgesic anti inflammatory medication to hit the market over years ago it is for mild to moderate pain and treats many different conditions such as arthritis bone inflammation joint pain and even reduces fever aspirin causes blood platelets to not adhere to each other thus it thins the blood and prevents blood clots from forming aspirin is thus used in emergency treatment of heart attacks and strokes some folks take a baby aspirin mgs each day to prevent blood clots from forming aspirin is actually acetyl salicylic acid manufacturers alter the structure of aspirin slightly to grant it different properties in terms of its digestion to make digestion easier some buffer it with antacids while others coat the tablet with a coating that prevents its digestion in the stomach like ecotrin regular aspirin without any buffering or coatings is tolerated by most people but some cannot take it without severe stomach upset for these folks the buffered form is a god send unfortunately aspirin fell out of favor in the s and s when reye s syndrome developed in some children under the age of who took aspirin while they had the flu and or chickenpox about of the children affected died and many more had permanent brain damage because of reye s syndrome alternate analgesics were placed on the market the premier being tylenol there is no reason to fear using aspirin if you are an adult as reye s syndrome only occurred in children under years of age the usual dose of aspirin is mg with the extra strength form at mg most adults will easily tolerate a dose of mg tablets every hours with a maximum daily dose of mg some with rheumatoid arthritis take up to mg day with a doctor s supervision there is no additional benefit to taking more than mg every hours increasing the dose beyond this point will only increase the toxicity of aspirin aspirin should be avoided in people taking blood thinning medications those with stomach ulcers and used with caution in insulin dependent diabetics allergies can develop to aspirin as well never mix aspirin with any of the non steroidal anti inflammatories such as ibuprofen as there is no pain benefit and the gastric upset chance is greatly increased don t mix aspirin with alcohol either as it is hard on the stomach used properly aspirin is a terrific medication i prefer to buy my aspirin in a generic form one pays more for aspirin if it is produced by a name brand manufacturer however the big manufacturers also package aspirin in some of the buffered forms that some people tolerate better jim konedog koenig
1,i have searched far wide for a product that aids in the treatment management of keratosis pilaris little red bumps on the backs of my arms it is estimated that of the population has a form of keratosis pilaris and there is no cure for the skin condition however this neostrata aha significantly reduced bumps and redness after only weeks after weeks it had almost vanished the only drawback is that after weeks of non use the bumps tend to resurface but if you keep the application up the bumps stay away i use it religiously over the summer or if i have any upcoming special occasions where i want to look my best i found the product in self magazine suggesting its use for keratosis pilaris management and have nothing but rave reviews finally something that works
1,the socks were nice but cost too much price a little unreasonable
0,the idea behind the pasta machine for clay is brilliant and makes flattening the clay and gradiating the clay much easier however i bought of these from my local craft store the first started giving me trouble after about a week the gears started to grind and black soot like ash came out metal shavings i proceeded to take the face plates off and clean it figuring clay was stuck inside meanwhile my youngest liked it and wanted one of her own so while working on trying to clean and repair the first one i bought another that one lasted days i brought them both back to the store i am going to try the amaco brand and see if it is better
1,my box arrived somewhat banged up but apart from a cosmetic scuff on one handlebar it was ok but after days i started hearing a noise seemed to come from the interior of the pedals gearbox sounded like a loose object bouncing around i was afraid i would have to ship it back i called schwinn and the woman asked me to take the pedals off and see if i could reproduce the sound i assured her it was not the pedals she said yes sir now please take the pedals off i did and it was the left pedal sounded just like the interior anyway they will send me new pedals so problem solved sounds like they have encountered this problem before also i was frustrated by the inability to see the blue display screen so i bought doorstops removed the standard mounting screws and used goop adhesive to make the screen lean forward now i can read it someone at scwinn did not do the q c on that screen issue anyway great bike now i m happy

1,the station agent is a touching yet off the beaten path kind of flick that i found simply endearing to watch fin peter dinklage has just inherited a train depot somewhere out in new jersey having a passion for trains he embraces this as his home however he only wishes to be left alone and finds that s not as easy to do as he would have thought first he discovers joe bobby cannavale who has set up a food truck outside his home joe is a conversationalist desperate to talk to anyone and everyone next fin meets olivia patricia clarkson who almost runs him off the road twice these three appear to have nothing in common and despite all odds they form a friendship that is heartwarming to see all three actors gave amazing performances dinklage as always commands every scene he is in i ve missed seeing him since the bastards at cbs quashed threshold so it was nice to see something with him in it again cannavale amused me with his character joe who really needed to get a life the idea of quite time is not something he can easily grasp to say the least and clarkson radiated as olivia a character trying to put her life back together again after having lost her son and having her husband leave her what i liked most about this flick is the honest portrayal it gave us of life through fin s eyes there were the chronic stares he got just for being smaller than average plus there was a scene in the grocery store where the cashier didn t even see that he was standing there so she didn t ring him up until he could get her attention it just made me think about what it must really be like to not fit in the standard mold physically all in all excellent film
1,driver install was easy and bitpim access works just fine the cable i received also charges the phone from verizon
1,i recently purchased an orgeon scientific s jumbo atomic wall clock with indoor temperature and have been delighted with it in every way my main concern before it arrived was the brightness of the display well this unit far exceeds my expectations it is very bright and is visible from a great distance a lot of lcd displays that i have seen on clocks etc have been very dim and to me very unsuitable another feature that this unit has is automatic time updates and i found that it not only works but works in my work place office my office is an interior office ie not located near any windows and it is able to pickup the time signal through our building walls this is amazing i have also found the s to be very attractive looking and very well designed five cheers for oregon scientific

1,this movie is almost years old can you believe it to those of you who haven t seen this classic my only question to you is why why in the world have you been depriving yourself of something so incredible so wonderful so fun so beautiful it is just one of those movies that makes you almost kind of sad that we don t have filmakers and storytellers like we used to we have become a group of people who are more interested in constant action that we have forgotten how to tell a story we have become a group of people who desire to be constantly stimulated rather than allowing ourselves to get interested and involved if this movie was created in today s market and it pains me to say this it would be a box office flop but fortunately it was made when it was made fortunately it had three of the most talented actors of our time in it the always incredible paul newman the likeable robert redford and the stunningly gorgeous katherine ross the combination of these three characters is absolutely magical if they made this movie today it would probably have in it brad pitt ben affleck and jennifer lopez yuk i better shutup before somebody gets a bright idea of remaking this classic movie i cannot even imagine somebody having the gall to even try and redo this jewel of a movie everything in this movie is top notch every scene is just gorgeous and full i was just a kid when i first saw it and i didn t fully understand all the layers that this movie contains now in my early i truly appreciate roy hill s vision everything seems so natural there is nothing forced in this movie there is nothing contrived there is nothing but pure movie magic if you ve been waiting for an invitation to finally see this movie consider this your invitation but i warn you do not buy it if your attention span is less than four seconds so if you ve read this entire review without changing the television channel or talking on the cell phone or text messaging one of your homies then you passed the test and you are free to view this incredible piece of cinema
0,i think a lot of the high scores given to this movie were based on emotion and patriotism however judged purely on its cinematic merits this movie is simply not very good the premise is excellent and if properly executed the movie could have been superb but it rapidly turns into an endless barrage of cartoonish cliches that have all been done countless times and better in movies like the dirty dozen see if any of these concepts seem familiar gather a rag tag team of misfits take them to a secluded training site where they are quickly and miraculously turned into dedicated disciplined fighters in this case by chopping down trees and carrying poles around the navy seals must have it all wrong their mission suffers several immediate reversals usually due to the evil government but the team members all bravely vote to continue anyway improvising as they go naturally a couple are killed usually the big and or ugly ones but the majority emerge relatively unscathed and victorious to a crescendo of soul stirring music this movie may indeed have been loosely based on real events but i absolutely positively guarantee you that the way the real soldiers looked acted and prepared for the mission bears no and i mean no resemblance to this gaggle of ninnies indeed superficial formulaic laughably simplistic movies like this are not only a disservice to heroic reality they are an insult check out the perfect haircut and snow white teeth on the prisoner rescued last robert stack s son ridiculous it s a shame that an accurate movie could not have been made about the real mission instead of this silly sanitized trite visualization one last question what is the net gain in sacrificing four people to save four people is this really a victory buy it rent it watch it if you must then see whose review hits this cliched nail on the head
1,i use these for mma type workout on bags blocking pads and they have worked well they give good protection even when hitting hard i have not had the problem with dye fading that i noticed with some other gloves overall i would reccomend about the same or less than other gloves from everlast century ect and just as good quality fyi there are a lot of visible seams where the pads pockets are attached especially on the fingers that you can t see well in the picture advertised i do t think this is a big deal as many bag gloves have this i wouldn t use them to spar as these would tend to cut most people would use fighting gloves to spar anyway but just trying to be helpful
0,if you re in search of a magazine for women that actually has worthwhile content then move on there is nothing of substance in cosmopolitan open the latest issue and you will find sex tips that will drive your man crazy and snag that cutie galore it s pathetic and sophomoric the sad thing is young women purchase magazines like this and want to emulate the fake lifestyles within that revolve around a looking for your one true love and by default b how to achieve multiple orgasms with random sexual partners boyfriends whilst on said search and let s not forget inane question and answer spreads those are a hoot with such inquires as my crack gets really itchy what should i do no this magazine is not my bible this is another publication that deserves to be thrown into a furnace
0,absolutely unwatchable cliche ridden so silly it s very nearly offensive it s like watching one long music video by a b level rapper full of dumb beautiful women buff monkey headed ghetto thugs and jokey tricked out cars without a doubt one of the worst movies i ve ever seen the script is laughable the acting worse vin diesel and paul walker are more dumb and dumber than butch cassidy and the sundance kid awful

1,we really like our graco digital imonitor it gives very clear sound in a good range of volumes and has a much longer range than any analog monitors that we tried previously we do not get quite the range that is claimed on the box usually it reaches about a city block depending on the strength of charge left in the rechargeable batteries the lights that light up for baby s sound are quite bright which can be a problem if you like to sleep in complete darkness i turn the monitor around so that the lights do not keep me awake
0,what a waste of time to air this up it developed leaks in less time to it took to enter the credit card info to order it this was the worst gift because it had such a high expectation but turned into the biggest disappointment the vinyl was so thin that rolling it over normal bermuda grass created holes from small seed pods and sticks save your money

0,please careful about this grooming kit i bought one week before and when i turn on first time it did not work and plug the power it did not work this product just missed the simple logic when i connected to power adapter why should it has to use battery power to work instead it should directly work with power adapter regardless of battery charged or not this lag of simple feature make me wait for hours to charge before i use it at that time my kid started to cry as i try to trim his hair also this can not be used for continuous use if you use for small trimming then you have to wait for the battery to charge
0,i m not a fan of stephen king film adaptations the only one i like is carrie bec it was directed by brian depalma and featured terrific performances by sissy spacek and piper laurie cujo is boring and not all that suspenseful i couldn t wait for it to end not worth purchasing okay as a rental

1,this was a hilarious movie even though i have never seen it before it had alot of funny scenes but as david rigsbey says it had no direction
0,i owned this set for about and a half years before i finally just gave up and switched to a different brand of hot rollers i used it about times per year first off the rollers are very heavy so when you have them all in place it feels like you are carrying a laundry basket on your head second the rollers are hot to the touch so burning can be an issue when rolling up your hair third the clips used to hold the rollers in place are fantastically difficult to use i would roll up my hair which would take like minutes because of the difficulty and if i walked around the house to watch tv while i waited for my hair to set the clips would spring out of place and shoot across the room i eventually lost like clips from the springing out thing the results of these rollers were great though i used them on my wedding day and people loved it good results but not worth the time and effort to use these rollers

0,sure it looks good and the gameplay is ok but the final boss jinpachi is really cheap and lame even at the easy difficulty just a couple of hits from this freak and you re dead the devil within mini game is also stupid some levels are just impossible and too hard i wouldn t mind it if you could save your game whenever you want to or at least just before some critical part of the game but unfortunately that is not the case here not to mention some save points are hidden imagine getting through the most boring levels doing extremely tedious yet dumb puzzles spending around hours or more to get to the boss level then finally finding yourself trying over and over to beat the boss until you just give up but you can t save your game then you re gonna have to redo the entire level again that is one sick stupid game design the only reason i m playing this mini game is just to get the hidden items
1,i love this product but i wish i could see all floors put together as completed home in view
1,perhaps the greatest cinematic experience of our generation although i believe i was in a different state of mind when i watched this stuff in college brilliant
1,though still not quite enough battery for the juice sucking q it is worlds better than the included battery i would love to see a clip on the back to attach the original battery as well to swap when the extended one dies
0,everyone in my family has owned these clic goggles my original pair gave out after three years of use i ordered these because they said standard size they normally come in small medium and large well i am medium and the standard size is large same as my husbands i had to tape them at the back to make them smaller so i could wear them did not have time to return very disappointed will consider this before ordering from you again

0,i ordered this product for my year old who just moved into a toddler seat and had head slumping problems the two major problems with this product is that it s quite bulky and so her head would tend to fall forward anyway and check if it will fit in your carseat i have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide and you can t leave the pillows in place they stand up at a degree angle i attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place this works but obviously only if you re sitting next to them when they fall asleep other than that you d have to stop the car get out and attach them then go again by which time the child is probably awake anyway to be honest i haven t seen a better alternative yet though it s quite good to pull around and use as a pillow for your own head on long trips though
0,this is another story that i don t know if i like it or not because amazon com never sent it too me this has happened about times while usually i have no problem getting movies sometimes i do sending them e mails doesn t seem to work if they didn t have the best prices for movies i d leave

1,this parking assist works as described its easy to install but the laser doesn t stay on long enough and even with the car in motion the light sometimes goes off before the car comes to a stop because it doesn t detect motion on the smooth one color surface my wife can t see the light on the front of the hood because she line of view is lower than mine however i find it working fine
1,i am so greatfull to this pump i was able to exclusively breastfeed two children for a year each while working full time taking vacations without the kids etc i also have the car adapter which is awesome i was able to pump to and from my work which is over an hour away while driving i only recommend that for breatfeeding pumping pros the warranty is only good for a year but mine is now three years old and still going strong we are expecting our third child and i hope my pump holds up for another year if not i will still probably spend the money on another pump like this one best of luck
1,i bought it through the target amazon store which was cheaper than the same product through other vendors its very easy to assemble although you may want to play with the chain a bit to set up the desired tension by shortening the chain to belt connection which can get chain grease on you a bit to me it was exactly as advertised a long rowing machine that is not too quite but far less loud than expected and works well i do not fold it away after use but its a nice feature if you want to move it to another part of the house and dont want to lug an foot long device
0,i couldn t read past the second chapter roberts is just perpetuating the same old stereotypes about muslims it really steamed me that she used a verse of the quran out of context for the title page of the bitter your wives are your fields so go to your fields as you like isn t meant as a justification of sexual abuse and has never been interpreted as so by real scholars of the quran i m not going to finish this book because i d rather not be reminded of how much i am viewed as some sort of exotic oppressed other type of woman thanks
0,this set is made of thin scratchy cheap fabric there is no shape to the gown awful
1,i won t include my website url here but i m a professional photographer who displays and sells his work at juried exhibitions i ve been using photoshop since version roughly years frankly i m surprised to see how many negative reviews there are here of photoshop and that overall the product only gets three stars i understand all the frustration though even on a top of the line machine ps can be slow at times however in my case that s because i m working on incredibly large files for example my camera scanner combination typically produces megapixel images by the time multiple layers are added in ps one image file can be mb gb in size this is exactly why i have a dual opteron system with gb of ram so i can work on these monster files in photoshop for me photoshop is a must have there are no alternative programs for me to consider that can handle my files and do what i want to get done i don t even want to mention all the advanced features that i use on a daily basis frankly because that s part of my edge as a professional i ve spent over five years working in ps everyday and have carefully studied several advanced books on ps the learning curve is long but the rewards are great if you have high goals and high standards yeah adobe s got some major improvements to make along the lines that other reviewers have mentioned for me the only real problem is poor and often wasteful use of system memory and i would agree with other reviewers here that for most people the full photoshop is probably a waste of money photoshop elements is probably a better way to go though i haven t used it personally i know a good web designer who uses paint shop pro and who seems to be happy imho some people are probably drawn to photoshop the way others are drawn to autocad or solidworks or studio max all these programs are incredibly powerful tools that can support an entire career if one puts in the time and effort to become a true expert user you can t make a career out of ps elements or paint shop pro or gimp or whatever else other reviewers may mention ps is the standard for image manipulation
1,jock rock is a must for anyone in the fitness business nothing gets a crowd hopping like a little james brown not much for listening to but a good collection when your looking for just the right song to play for a certain event
1,my unit was really easy to install no wires just suction cups for the main unit and no tools required for the temperature unit i drive mostly during the day so i like the unit but those who do night driving cannot see the dim light i had to remove unit in order to pass the va state inspection in cold weather the temp guage sometimes does not work also about the temp sensor if you place it too near the hot parts of the radiator it will not be accurate while driving in town or when stopped behind the front license tag is great i put an old license tag under the new one and drilled holes to hold the temp sensor that method works great i really like the automatic calibration feature

0,you can bet those people gaving vista a good rating here work for the company it s a piece of junk if you have a good working xp or anything else please don t buy vista i bought it a month ago already installed on a good hp computer i ve worked on it from sun up to sun down for a month and still all i ve got is a pile of junk and it s so slow that you have to take a coffee break while it s gathering up a program to run don t buy their one care either i ve owned windows since i m considering re installing my old hp xp it s still here in the closet
0,i am a huge fan of btnh but even i will admitt this is not a good album the worst being home which uses samples from phil collins the whole thing feels kind of empty with very little of the passion that you would hear on the groups earlier works there are a few songs worth listening to most notably is clevland is the city which is one of the only songs that still sounds like it has any harmony to it other songs worth mentioning are what about us not my baby and pump pump the rest of the album in my opinion is garbage it is not surprising that the group broke up shortly after this album was released
0,save your time money and patience this may be the worst book i have read since the equally monotonous predictable stone barrington novel the short forever wow this one stinks like others i put up with the shallow characters ludicrous dialogue and endless parade of showers boobs and guns to figure out whodunit unfortunately this book had an ambiguous ending that seeks to be clever but is instead is just stupid who on earth did kill vance and come to think of it who gives a damn i don t what women did to stuart woods but he sure seems to hold them in complete contempt every female character save for isabel the maid felt compelled to practically rape our handsome hero each is flawless and gorgeous but also all are dumb vacuous self centered and thoroughly unlikeable hey a couple are even truly psychotic the only normal female character who spared stone mary ann unfortunately has a room temperature iq i am hardly a prude but i lost count of how many women either vance or stone made love to in the course of one short novel and felt the need to take a long hot shower to rid myself of the feelings of filth mr woods either lives in a world of complete ignorance or the reading public is a lot less discriminating than i thought
1,my boys love them they draw in the car and their cup can sit on it kinda a pain for short drives but wonderful for longer trips
1,i have not yet used an or but i think this thing beats the pants off an or as far as image quality is concerned really nice camera has a nice dslr type feel of people that check out the here actually end up buying the as of today but i do not believe the iq of the could hold a candle to that of the buyers may be on the more megapixel bandwagon you can do a lot with megapixels i have found that the iq of the is very close to that of a dslr
0,i rated stars because the joint from the kid s bike to the parent bike was too lose and the child was almost falling off from the bike i also contact the company who made this product and they told me that they will send another part that will make the child s bike straight but i never recived the part i am very disappointment about because the safety of my kid is first and they didn t help me i hope that in some future purchase the company can assist me on my needs thank you
0,my daughter placed this crib on her registry mainly because of the price she didn t want anyone spending on a crib and this one matched the style she was looking for i found this set up at a depot store and it was beautiful and sturdy but didn t come in natural so i went home and ordered it online it arrived days before the shower days early from eta but it was shattered the first pieces we looked at were split chipped crushed quite a surprize considering the box wasn t in bad shape we decided to return it and buy a more expensive model at a local specialty store amazon s return policy was amazing a click on the mouse and the next day ups picks up no packing labels to print no lugging big heavy items to post office very simple amazon gets stars storkcraft
1,it has its own table and light it s used consistently by grandchildren and grandparents alike it s stopped a dropped large dictionary suffering a broken spine it s a great affordable dictionary stand and it s all mine
0,i bought this product for my cell wich was listed on their description and it so happens that the software will not work they did not sent the drivers i would not do business with this people again this has not only been a waiste of money but also a waiste of time amazon should not permit them take people s money like that amazon suports those fakes
0,i had a feeling that this toy would be trouble when i saw the delivery guy walking up to our front steps with a weird grin on his face evidently the box had been vrooming vibrating and shrieking throughout his rounds and he was only too glad to end his term as its temporary steward my two year old has largely lost interest in this toy he doesn t mind the shaking and noise but more often than not it just vrooms and then doesn t go anywhere my advice buy matchbox or hot wheels or something more reliable with volume control this will probably be in our next load of donations thrift shoppers beware
0,what they said was that katy can t rock just yet because she s a raw talent and not yet coherent in theme i saw her live on the chicks with attitude tour with liz phair and the cardigans and charlotte martin and rose was the worst performer of the night the first problem is that her voice just isn t that strong secondly her lyrics never come out as if they re honest and as if they are always a pretension that people feel a cool girl growing up should say throughout her set there was only one song that stuck out as an interesting and unique thing passingly honest as well and that was snowflake it s fitting that the song was preceded by an ironic intro about how she s lived in california for a long time but she hates warm weather sounds impossible but she must be truthful because it s the only song that breaks out of the leaden grunge guitar mix and hits the audience over the head with songcraft i m sure she has potential for the future but i think on her next album she should take a hint from beth orton who s known previous to her most recent album for being a popular artist in the realm of trip hop stripping down your sound brings the utmost fundamentals of your idea and sound out and i think that could be helpful for her to put on record
0,not only did this phone not work but the screen was really quite tiring on my eyes the only ringtone that it had was a sound like beads being shaken up the flashing light was distracting and its features were extraordinarily limited the camera option didn t work at all and where the heck was the texting my parents bought this phone for me for my birthday and it really made me mad i can see that this might be a good starter phone but you can only get calls froim it and really limited reception in the mountains switch to a razr as soon as possible
1,i got this movie in a three dvd pack from a local dealer it came along with the movies eaten alive and massacre in dinosaur valley i d have to say that all three movies were worth the dollars i spent on the three pack the movie jungle holocaust is an adventure movie in a different spin i dont really consider this a horror movie at least in the conventional sense the movie is exceptionally well done in the development of cinematography the storyline is interesting and the acting and er scenes are engrossing to use a phrase what i would really call this is an anthropological adventure to the extreme a civilized man placed in a totally uncivilized surroundings communications are not what you would get off the local street corner worldviews are nonexistent at least to the tribe in this film so there is no connection except savagery maybe this movie would have a greater tie with golding s lord of the flies a fascinating movie that brings you to the heart of a world that we especially in first world countries like the us have forgotten about i would suggest end of the spear as a christian look at examining these prehistoric people that film isn t a horror film it is a christian film but it is as i am a christian an interesting exploration of meeting such tribal people on their own territory
1,this is a great simple fast game that is fun for all ages
1,i have had mine for years and it has worked out great the main difference between this offset barbecue and more expensive ones is the lack of complete air control there are simply too many open seams to allow in air so it takes a bit of tending to keep the temperature at that said with a bit of patience and practice you can make excellent barbecue on this thing the metal gauge is heavy enough to last you several years though eventually the firebox will burn out
1,i m and i m having a blast on this board it s much more accessible than snowboarding and surfing because you can just grab your board and go i take mine to a local tennis court for the smooth surface they recommend using small hills and stuff but honestly stopping or slowing down is pretty much impossible on a decent incline so i prefer to stay on flat land its amazing how long you can stay on the board without even setting a foot on the ground the board seems to be constructed fairly well i ve gotten to the point where i can some pretty advanced turns by shifting my weight effectively its really fun trying to master it i m curious if the ripstik competitor board is better constructed since its made by razor and they might have put more money into the design anyways i ve had mine for about months and the wheels are definately showing a lot of wear i ll most likely have to replace them soon i m kinda happy that you can use any rollerblade wheels instead of some proprietary wheels that enables you to look for good deals on some wheels i d also look around for the best deals on these boards i got mine at a sports authority on sale for after having seen one at an fao on my visit to las vegas for so if you re a fun loving adult who likes cool new ways of moving along i d definately recommend this it s addicting
0,we received this as a employee gift and were so excited to have it not only does it not fill anything pass psi the cord is very cheaply made where it plugs into your cig lighter the plastic on the tip started to crack after pulling it out with the few more times we used it i the tip completely broke at least it comes with year warranty save yourself the disapointment and headache
1,out of the seasons i have seen this is my absolute favorite because sophia is my favorite character ans she just shines in this one she has some classic moments like when she goes to a friends funeral makes up with her friends husbad then comes home to get lucky and then married she leaads a secret life by doing volenteer work at a hospital and many many more great things the rest of the girls are great also as usual this is definatley the girls at their bes

0,i wrote a review but i guess it was so bad for ultramagnetic amazon booted it the album is trash nothing at all like the studio albums made over a decade ago but don t take my word for it sample for yourself ahead of their time faith no more what can i say about this album without my review getting kicked off amazon again i ve used no profanity or content of explicit nature but this album highly does s critical beatdown never ever gave that kind of deliverance that s why that s a classic and the best kept secret is not by any means vocally production lyrically concept can i get a witness please dj moe luv is the only producer on the album trying to keep that old ultramagnetic sound alive here on vibrato and mechanism nice born twice the album s single ced gee kills the album verbally and lyrically bragging of bars in almsot every track and being very explicit and obscene never heard that on critical beatdown by ced kool keith does fine on solo track late nite rumble but kool keith is goin nowhere with his lyricism and on most of the other songs his delivery is sounding just like ced s towards the end of the album t r love m i a you see him in photos you hear silence from him he doesn t even produce a track production by ced moe and others and the other sound like kutmasta kurt producing producer for most of kool keith solo stuff i do not mean that in a good way the beats of nottz is bangin the lyrics by both keith and ced should raise eyebrows on what s next to come for the best kept secret being the b side to the single mechanism nice born twice songs like ain t it good u and party started are for gentleman s clubs for the girls to dance to now do you see what direction this album is goin if you re lookin for ultramagnetic to comback with a reunion album with the same spacey super dope production and or the masterful brainiac monkey wrench lyricism as critical beatdown funk your head up and the four horsemen albums gave you over a decade ago you will not find it here maybe in the next years right ultramag
1,if you need to keep abreast of financials and business on a monthly basis forbes and fortune are the two conventional choices i started reading fortune and subscribing four years ago when i realized that the business people with whom i associated regularly simply assumed that one knew any news or analysis that broke in its pages it fits as a must read monthly overview in my reading habits fortune represents a generally bullish and strongly pro business perspective with just a touch of cynicism about corporate leadership and its trends you won t find anything radical here but you need to have read it if this kind of news analysis and opinion fits your job description or personal interests there is a smattering of toys for the businessperson in each edition for me the highlight is stanley bing s delicious irreverent and every so slightly jaded backpage column i routinely scan it or mail it to a relative who laughs out loud at bing s corporate lunacy as i do fortune is behind the eponymous fortune and other derivative lists for me one of the most valuable is the magazine s annual largest corporations by revenue though this is dictated by the scope of my own interests other readers will tear out or access other fortune lists online with equal interest if you re in business or work with people who are you d better be reading fortune or forbes or both
1,the armoire is very pretty but please show pictures of the inside of the furniture pieces because i was expecting something else i still like it very much but i wanted a part to hang clothes and it doesn t have one it is very pretty and from the outside it was everything i was expecting thank you
1,this is a very fun show and i enjoy watching it i bought all the episodes available and they all worked great its good to pay less to view
1,it fits great but doesn t cover the corners of the phone kinda the point of a case the seam at the top of the ear piece is sharp and stabs your ear if not careful the bolt on the back is not removable so if you do not plan to use the belt clip you re stuck with it sticking out in your pocket
1,i am a traveling songwriter and just finished a mile tour from nebraska to florida with this on the top of my subaru and i must say it was great thing to have everything stayed bone dry and secure but i would recommend usuing a couple of extra bungee cords across the top just as an added measure plenty of room and solid construction for the price it can t be beat
0,hey folks this is brilliant and all like the articles say but what they don t mention is that it s impossible to listen to there are no verses choruses or even beats to speak of there are no songs it s just a sound collage or something from start to finish the booklet prints lyrics but i couldn t find em this music is too brilliant for its own good and you can forget about using it as party or background music jdub s other offerings are much better

1,but not the only one you should get make this a purchase but get live dead also because it has all different songs and then look at other live releases the dead have a lot of good recordings just pick and choose among them this one has become a staple of great dead songs in my collection it is amazing how many good songs they have and how intimidating it seems to get their best stuff but you can t go wrong with this release even though some people feel it isn t up to scratch
0,this is the worst purchase i have made from amazon or anyone else the first unit arrived with several parts broken and the tread immovable after a number of calls to tech support it was decided to return and replace the unit amazon promptly replaced the treadmill this one had a movable and usable tread but the electronic display did not function my friend at tech support did not have a clue he suggested that he send me all the electircal cables used on this unit it is not clear what i am to do with them i strongly recommend that anyone wanting a manual treadmill puchase it from a diffrerent manufacturer
1,this product work perfectly in the epson printer the quality of printing is great
1,i ve had this wireles temperature station for about months now and i m very happy with it i mounted the wireless sensor in my outdoor screened porch to both keep it dry and out of the direct sunlight direct sunlight would likely result in innacurately high readings the base station is usually in our kitchen but for a while i moved it around different rooms of our house to see how much the indoor temperature varies from room to room the outdoor sensor never lost contact with the base the indoor temp reading is accurate and is within degrees of thermostats i have in the house and the outdoor temp is accurate with degrees of an outdoor mounted thermometer that is also in the screened porch i enjoy the convenience of quickly and easily knowing what the outdoor temp is in the morning this product works as advertised and i m very happy with it enjoy
1,worth the money get lots of hours out of it yet is closr to warcraft civilization style gam
0,the book is fine except i had to skip lengthy descriptions about the dog trainer she s such a boring character she s young but not motivated to work in fact she quited one of her jobs when macon covered her rent the dog training job was just a pretext for her to try to hook up with some men and get support the point is that she doesn t enjoy the job thus a detailed description of her dog training job which she doesn t seem to enjoy was just a boring digression

0,i was so dissapointed with this camera i purchased a sony cybershot years ago and it had been such a great camera i automatically thought this newer model would be great almost every picture i took was either blurry or the light areas of the picture were blown out as an experienced cybershot user i tried all settings to fix the problem but no luck terrible for capturing a child s first steps as the description says would not recommend
1,our year old hated riding her bike with training wheels because she felt like it was too tippy and we wondered if she would ever figure it out then we found this one got it for her for christmas and she loves it after months she can now ride a traditional bike with no training wheels and she was the youngest on the block to do so it is all due to this bike i never would have believed it since she was petrified of riding a bike with training wheels before and when the other girls on the block took off their training wheels there were lots of tears they screamed for their training wheels back and their parents had to run along side them for days trying to teach them how to balance but our daughter just took off and we didn t even have to help her now we are loaning out the scoot so the other kids can learn to balance too in fact i just ordered our year old a bike with pedals i m pretty sure he can ride without the training wheels too the way that he speeds around on the scoot it was well worth the purchase

1,elaine pagels is a wonderful writer her explanation into early christianity is wonderful it is definitely worth the time to read this she delves into the politics of the early church the passion the resurrection as well as the clashes between gnostic and orthodox thinking too often we forget that what we call the canon is not the only writings available she just reminds us that there is this whole other world of writings that did not make it into the bible for one reason or another if you want to get an idea of who the gnostics were read this
0,the premise put forth in the title is supported by some keen insights into leadership by calling and comparisons to it with modern leadership theory les csorba writes about the danger of pursuing results without compassion a point with which i agree unfortunately some of the examples he chooses are questionable after warning about the danger of weak character in powerful leaders csorba chastises german chancellor schroeder for turning back on some promises to george w bush regarding the war on terrorism and then goes on to deride him for his four wives meanwhile he praises jack welch for going from neutron jack to a gentler jack which jack says he would abandon if needed while still making the tough decisions that got the results for the shareholders jack can change is mind and go back to compassionless results ok also there is no mention that jack was getting results with his personal secretary whilst the wife was at home unfortunately the theme in csorba s examples becomes one of bashing the mistakes of democrats and forgiving the sins of the republicans he does sprinkle in some condemnation for a few wrong minded republicans in a meek attempt at balance it s a shame that he turned this into a politcally tainted work it started off so well it started off well even though it will turn off readers who are not people of faith as faith is central precept to this book it also started off well even though he chose to make george w bush the role model for how to be a trust able leader unfortunately this conservative political bent turned an even harder right from there and kept going it kept going to the point that i could no longer plan on sharing this book with some folks i know who really need it they would simply say its a bush ie right winger book and dismiss the valuable and otherwise soundly argued premise too bad csorba almost had a classic instead of a politically tainted leadership manual i say this even though i am republican am one of the few folks who would admit they were voting for bush before the election am a person of faith and tend to find the dems an easy target but this book was supposed to be about so much more than republican politics too bad
0,i was overwhelmed by the choices and selected this model in part because of the reasonal price i had read reviews which mentioned problems and the need to return the product but i decided there was only a small possibility of that happening the instructions said to use the lowest setting initially which certainly made sense however the instructions said to move the adjustment toward the tip which turned out to be the highest not the lowest setting the diagram on the handle indicated that the movement was toward the larger opening but i read the directions and did not look at the diagram until later the spray was very powerful and actually hurt especially when it was by my tooth with a crown the next day i tried adjusting the settings with the pik over my sink not in my mouth it felt wonderful on the lower setting i reread the directions again and again over the next several days to see if the error was mine or theirs i still think the directions were not written properly the third day i had trouble getting any spray at all this continued for about a week some days getting more or less but never a full spray on any setting my guess is that it was in a permanent pause mode i gave up and pursued returning the item it needed to be returned to an authorized repair which luckily was only a few miles away there were only three in my state the repair man had told me over the phone it was a discontinued model and hadn t been made in about a year when he looked at it he found it had been made in he said he could fix it but wasn t allowed to i am awaiting a replacement to arrive in the mail

0,cook s illustrated is the first cooking magazine that i d found myself truly motivated to read cover to cover even though they do insert advertisements for their own products which i suppose to them makes this an ad free magazine but i m not surprised they ve bent the rules with that claim the one time i found it necessary to contact cook s illustrated about a customer service issue i was simply floored by the treatment that i received i ll simply leave it at that i personally don t intend on re subscribing fine cooking here i come you however may find that this is the cooking magazine for you and as far as what they do goes cook s illustrated is good at what they do i ll give them that if you have not found this review to be helpful i m sorry if i haven t made the value in my warning apparent just know that there are those of us out there who have had bad experiences and are simply trying to prevent others from experiencing the same
0,seldom do i write a review downgrading a product but this one is truly the exception i bought this one on ebay and thought i was getting a good deal price wise it was great however it would appear that the designer of this organizer tried to put so many features into it that it ends up doing nothing well the directions are terrible they are extremely difficult to follow i never could get it to sync with outlook i fear that today i will waste more time trying to get it to work i owned one of the first palm pilots and it was child s play in comparison in this case you get what you pay for don t purchase this you ll be sorry take care it s a time bandit and even if it were to function flawlessly the design with all of its attempted functions is way too much punch this button to get to this screen which will take you to the next screen ad nauseum do you carry the manual with you put together in another country and probably by someone not entirely familiar with the english language truly disappointed with this worthless plastic

0,firstly let me say the research nicholas lardy has conducted is commendable and a welcome addition to the existing literature his data sources are vast and highly informative the major limitation of this publication is that the central argument is biased lardy selects those data and pieces of existing literature which support his own view as a result major sections of the literature concerning financial reform in transitional economies are simply ignored or brushed over lardy s view is the typical western dare i say american argument primarily he uses financial criteria to evaluate the economic performance of china s state banks this methodoloy is extremely poor particularly in the context of china s trannsitional economy financial criteria are a horrible guide to both internal and allocative economic efficiency if anyone would like elaboration on this point feel free to email me in summary lardy s book is informative and makes for interesting reading however as a piece of economic analysis its usefulness is limited the major reason for this is a total lack of economic theory as indicated by the previous reviewer which has resulted in a poor methodology

1,i and more importantly my twin boys really like this jumper it seems safer than the doorway jumper mainly because their fingers won t get mushed i like that it has multiple height settings and that it s on a sturdy frame they love to jump in it and before they were able to crawl it was one of the few ways for them to get out some of that excess energy and get some exercise plus it s a nice safe place for times when i d like to get something done without having to keep a constant eye on one of the babies the cons that wouldn t keep me from buying it again are it takes up more room than a doorway jumper the rattly bear is pretty loud and the music is obnoxious there is an on off switch and two volume settings for the music though

0,i tried as hard as i could but just could not get into this book not quite as bad as her book impossible but close danielle steel is getting so repetitive in her writing basically this book repeated over and over how much quinn liked sailing and how he neglected his wife throughout the years and that he didn t realize how much she meant to him until she was dying dead drivel she could have elaborated on what was supposedly the storm of the century but ended it quickly or expanded on the characters themselves but no a waste of time very hard to get through as there really is nothing there to get into at all disappointing to say the least
1,i purchased one of these shirts to see what the quality was compared to the price as soon as i received it and wore it twice i went back and purchased three more the weave on these shirts is thick making the shirt very comfortable to use and i suspect will give it a long life after multiple washings the first one i purchased still feels as good as the newer ones the colors are warm i would suspect that this shirt would cost as long as the price stays below i will continue to purchase these as all purpose daily wear work out tshirt as for the comment that these fit smaller than most i didn t have that experience in nike reebok gap and rusell athletic tshirts i wear a large i wear a large in artiga as well and the fit is comparable to those brands with no noticeable shrinkage after washing

1,this is a great lens i do not want to repeat all the good things other reviewers have written about this lens it is not so heavy so i use tripod without using tripod collar costs in b h this is the best value i have ever got for a lens now i can t wait to get too you can get a very nice bokeh when wide open at and of course depending on the how far the background is from the subject people complain how ugly the hood looks but that is subjective i like it because it works great and you can attach it in a reversed position on the lens so that it will fit in your camera bag i think the fit and finish of the lens is beautiful
0,we received this item as a gift from grandma because my son loves barnyard animals barns etc he loves the tent however the construction was so poorly thought out that he cannot touch it without it falling over and collapsing on top of him there is no way to anchor it to the floor weights etc to keep it from toppling over the sides have no stabilization whatsoever the idea is super but maybe they should consider more product testing to ensure its durability
0,i purchased the murad acne complex for or so for a measley one month supply i was disgustingly excited to try it as everything else has failed me proactiv works wonderfully for me but only for the first month or two then it seems i grow an immunity to it i paid to have the murad acne complex expedited to me because i was so anxious to get on to beautiful clear skin i read the pamphlet and understood that my skin could go through a purging phase where your skin literally purges all of the bacteria and other acne causing assailants imagine the worst skin you ve ever seen imagine the most painful breakouts that was my personal purging process it was literally the worst breakout of my entire life my husband kept telling me to continue using the products though because this was expected i m still using the products and though my skin is better than it was weeks ago i m basically back where i was when i started i give up but i m not giving up any more money to murad
0,i bought this doll because at the expensive price i figured it would be the best it definitely is not patty is cute but that is the only good thing about her to fill up her bottles you must squeeze and insert into a glass of water then squeeze again until water shoots out and then reinsert into the glass of water again it requires it to be done in such a particular way that only an adult can fill the bottles with water no small child will be able to master the precise way it takes then to feed patty you must hold her very still at an exact angle where she is almost standing up most children cradle their baby dolls in their arms but patty will not drink in that position even in the standing up position most of the water spills out of the tiny hole for her mouth and soaks her outfit it takes minutes to fill patty up most children don t have the patience for this and lose interest as my daughter did plus since she has to be perfectly still and at an exact angle only an adult can feed patty her water then to make her pee you must press her thigh very hard this distressed my daughter because she thought i was hurting patty once i assured her patty was ok then she was upset because she was not strong enough to press hard enough to make patty pee my daughter is months old and a lot of children start training earlier at months old my daughter was not able to fill the bottles feed patty or make her pee only an adult can do these things due to the complexity of the bottles and feeding and peeing systems of patty so my daughter quickly lost interest in patty and started squirting water all over the bathroom instead with the bottles the whole teach the doll to pee part of the potty training was lost i wish i had gone to the store and bought a cheap wetting doll instead then i e mailed the company to complain but of course received no response and you can t get a full refund if the doll has been used in fact getting a refund at all is extremely difficult i have just given up on that don t waste your money this doll is too expensive and cannot be used by a child which defeats the whole purpose go to your toy store and buy a cheap wetting doll at least that way if you don t like it you can return it unlike patty
1,my daughter got this pool for her first birthday and she loves it this pool is big enough that i can just get in with her and we have a blast because of her age i don t fill it up all the way and it still works just fine it just looks a little funny i found it really easy to set up and easy enough to pack away i was a little confused at first when folding it up but within moments i had it put away and every time i use it i find it easier and easier this pool is great for traveling to grandma s house too i would recommend this to anyone young and old
1,my year olds sons received this toy for christmas they are huge pokemon fans so just the fact that it has pokemon pictures on it made the toy worth it fortunately it also happens to be fun to play to players try to allow the fewest balls possible past their own paddles the fewest points wins each player has their own scorekeeper for up to games setting up the game after every round gets a little tedious however it s not so bad if everyone helps the best things for me are that i don t mind playing unlike the actual pokemon cards which are a boring nightmare for me and it doesn t require batteries my year old daughter likes to play too although she loses every time we just don t tell her if your kids like pokemon this is a good toy

1,you know if anything happens to me you re in command says sergeant kelly thomas mitchell to corporal colin spence henry fonda they re lost in the libyan desert with only three gallons of petrol left for their remaining armored car almost no water and a busted compass sergeant kelly started out with corporal spence and twelve other men on a routine patrol three german fighters changed things now there s only sergeant kelly spence and four others nothing s going to happen to you sergeant spence says i mean it can t it won t lad if i can help it still if i stop a packet it s up to you to get this patrol back and that s not an easy job but i m no leader spence says i haven t had the experience to take up a command like this with other men s lives depending on me i can carry out orders but i can t give them i m just a civilian with a couple of chevrons on my sleeve the immortal sergeant tells us the story of colin spence a small town reporter from canada in england who is shy and not really able to accomplish the things he wants please note that while elements of the plot are discussed the key elements are all described on the dvd case it s obvious valentine maureen o hara loves him but he just can t seem to recognize the signals just before he enlists she and colin meet an old friend of colin s at a party benedict reginald gardner is now a famous war correspondent good old colin i tell you this lad has a head on his shoulders says benedict to valentine i m afraid he s a little bit too self effacing for the times though you know like the good old democracies nice but a little bit too civilized for his own good eh colin benedict smoothly moves in on valentine and colin can only look on spence keeps remembering valentine while he and the rest of the patrol struggle through the desert now on foot the sergeant leads the men in an attack on an isolated german armored car they hope to find water and perhaps even capture the car and drive back to their own lines the sergeant is clear about what they must do this war like every other war is going to be won by men on their feet with guns in their hands and don t you forget it he tells them but the car is destroyed in the attack the cans of german water with it and two more men in the patrol die the sergeant is one of them colin spence has no choice but to take command now and slowly as he faces the reality of the situation he becomes more forceful and more resourceful the three other men one a little reluctantly accept his leadership he knows he doesn t have the answers he relies on his memory of sergeant kelly and his memory of valentine to keep him moving forward at the climax he leads a desperate attack on an oasis guarded by three times the number of germans it is an attack which is bravely led and fought back in a cairo hospital colin spence sums it up i had to come all the way out here to meet a tough sergeant named kelly who was born in a slum and educated in an army camp before i was fit for a woman like valentine he s dead now but he taught me one thing if i ever want valentine or anything else worthwhile in life i ve got to fight for it that s not a bad thing for a man to find out or for a nation either for that matter to fight this is an appealing war time movie with little of the bravado and obvious emotional string pulling of most war movies thomas mitchell gives a fine performance and maureen o hara would be any man s dream of the woman waiting back home what takes this movie out of the ordinary is henry fonda did any major hollywood star before or after combine so effectively almost naive honesty decency and acting skill we sympathize with colin spence s shyness we sympathize with spence s nervousness at the idea of being in charge if his sergeant is killed we see and approve of spence s taking on the responsibility of leading the remaining men of the patrol and we come to admire his dedication to do the right thing to fight against the odds for a good cause the immortal sergeant is a film that with time sort of slipped between the cracks dvd has brought it back and it s worth seeing the dvd transfer is just fine there are no significant extras

0,if a suspense filmed was played in the woods and it didn t actually contain any suspense would a bear watch it the previous sentence makes about as much suspense as the reason behind making domestic disturbance the newest thriller starring john travolta vince vaughn and teri polo let s talk for a few minutes about mr travolta can anyone name an actor who has received more chances in his career and squandered them i think that travolta has now surpassed richard dreyfuss as the comeback lose it again king after a brilliant comeback engineered by his longtime admirer quentin tarantino in pulp fiction travolta appeared in a number of films that were interesting and proved interesting choices face off and broken arrow highlighted a string of hits that ultimately allowed travolta to join the million club in the last few years every film travolta has appeared in has failed miserably lucky numbers the general s daughter that film was a hit but can anyone even remember one significant scene from it swordfish interesting but a flop battlefield earth why does he keep making this trash it has to be the paychecks i can t see any other conceivable reason john baby how long before the studios realize that these films aren t making any money and they stop hiring you john baby how long before you need another comeback vehicle frank morrison john travolta is a divorced father who makes wooden boats he doesn t get a lot of business but the business that he does get gets a great deal he doesn t charge his customers enough to make a profit frank does this because he is the good guy his son danny matthew o leary has a lot of problems accepting his mom s teri polo new relationship with rick barnes vince vaughn he gets into a lot of trouble and lies to everyone a couple of days after his mom and rick get married he stows away in rick s car and witnesses him murdering a business associate the police don t believe him however after a little soul searching frank believes his son he may lie to everyone but he doesn t lie to frank directed by harold becker sea of love domestic disturbance is a suspense film without any suspense from the moment danny stows away in rick s car and watches him murder ray steve buscemi which we also watch we know who the good guy is and who the bad guy is to make matters worse frank instantly believes his son which means that the film boils down to a cat and mouse game between frank and rick a boring cat and mouse game when you know the identity of the villain a huge percentage of the suspense is flushed down the toilet when frank believes danny early on the rest of the suspense is flushed down with it the film would ve been greatly improved by showing danny in the backseat of the car watching everything the pain and suspense registering on his face while the audience sees nothing then when danny tries to convince his dad the police chief his mom that rick is a murderer at least we haven t seen the act and we would require some convincing as well because the filmmakers chose to show us everything the next logical step to provide some suspense would be to have frank doubt danny his son however after a very brief segment frank believes danny causing us to watch a battle between frank and rick which isn t very interesting each of the actors including travolta are serviceable in their roles but because the film robs us of just about everything in the first fifteen minutes the remaining ninety become an exercise in tedium skip domestic disturbance it isn t even worthy of a video rental go to see the far superior and very different amelie or the man who wasn t there your money will be much better spent

0,in theory this sounds awesome but in reality is comes really close to being useless the spa is nothing more than a light flow of water which isn t even enough to create bubbles it comes out of the corner of the pump unit so hardly any of the stream will reach your baby the shower head has a button that is nearly impossible to keep pressed in for longer than seconds the flow of water is very weak so is not powerful enough to rinse out hair a cup does a better job than this the tub itself is pretty decent the plateau used to lay your baby on seems nice and comfy and the temperature indicator is a nice bonus all in all i wish we had saved our money and just gone with a normal tub i advise anyone else to do the same
1,i got a nikon laser rangefinder for chrisymas and it had an magnification i found this to be to powerful for golf i could not hold it steady on the flag the magnification on the bushnell yardage pro scout was much better also it is very compact and stores easily in my golf cart the price from amazon was well below i could find anywhere else
1,this dry iron is absolutely amazing i really can t say enough about it great for all types of hair it heats up in just seconds and what would take almost to blow dry my hair now takes less than half the time plus your hair comes out extremely straight highly recommend to anyone who wants their hair to look great but doesnt have the time or energy to sit in a hair salon for hours it is an investment in your hair one of the better ones i ve made
1,i gave one to my nephew for christmas and he and everyone else has liked it so well that everybody in the family tried it out and i now have to order one for his mother and also one for my husband the projection feature is great and the projection display is actually larger and brighter than i thought it would be to be honest i have to mention the drawback the display on the clock itself is so small and not backlit so you have to be pretty close to it to see the time during the day until someone puts a projection feature on a larger size cd alarm clock we will continue to keep our old alarm clock and put this one on the other side of the bed and use it mainly for the projection feature even with the drawback mentioned we all love the clock my nephew loves being able to see what time it is without putting on his glasses
1,i thoroughly enjoyed playing final fantasy viii from the introductory movie i was hooked the world and story were very unique as well as the new battle system i thought the junction system was fairly easy to understand and once i got used to it i loved it more than the materia system of vii the characters in viii were all very likeable it was interesting to play the game from the perspective of a student named squall who happens to be one of my favorite heroes of the final fantasy series the cinematics in the game were very nicely produced and captured the best moments from start to finish i had fun playing this game and highly recommend it to fans of the final fantasy series and role playing games in general
1,i bought this product almost a month ago its sleek its reliable and has all good features a good digital camera should worth the money for a sony camera this camera has the usualy seen high quality for a sony product
1,having been a bw subscriber for more than two years i found bw is one of the best business magazines in the us it is funny to see some readers accused bw to be biased granted bw criticized many policies of current administration because they were against long term growth of the economy some of them were pure political manipulations such as steel tariff those policies will do no one s good business is business for those party faithfuls who spring to defense anytime their party being criticized regardless the causes they don t need to read anything intelligent and balanced fox news will be suffecient
0,this product description is correct concerning putting the unit together and the portablity of the unit what it doesn t say is that you really get a workout no matter what incline it is in it feels as though you are walking up a hill in sandy soil if you want a strenuous workout then this unit is for you if you simply want the unit just to simulate normal walking on a level surface then this is not the unit for you
0,i purchased a brand new samsung and right out of the box the battery cover would not stay on the phone i went to a genuine t mobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good half an hour they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit the sales rep had a himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit clearly a manufactuering defect by samsung i contacted samsung for a replacement after six weeks of hassling them over the issue the end result was that the battery cover is not included in the warranty what end result i get to duct tape my battery in place thanks if you re going to spend serious money on a high end phone go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product clearly not samsung
1,it would be easy to say that this is the single greatest performance of the mahler eighth ever recorded i believe it is but it would be difficult to say that and have it mean something because after experiencing this colossal achievement the competition including alphabetically abbado bernstein chailly haitink horenstein kubelik nagano olson colorado mahlerfest solti and tennstedt among others suddenly seemed far less impressive than they once had what sets this mahler eighth so far apart from virtually every other is its sense of ecstasy of a transcendent vision being communicated of a religious fervor mahler had an extraordinary plan in putting together what he considered his most important work such that he could bring us to the brink and say there it s out there you can t see it but you can divine it and call it what you will god or love or some all embracing power outside of ourselves most performances miss the mark then in one of two ways by remaining resolutely earthbound or by trying to capture that vision in terms we can understand the problem of course is that if we can understand it it s no longer a vision it s something mundane in the closing pages of wit s extraordinary and that word as well as any other hardly begins to do it justice performance you become aware of that vision existing just beyond your comprehension you know it s there only because you re willing to take that leap of faith and that s what i mean when i say he brings the piece a sense of religious fervor there is nothing dogmatic about the kind of religion i m referring to here so let s look at the basic components of the performance element by element the sound spectacularly natural and all encompassing the soloists emerge from the overall sonic image like members of the orchestra and the chorus orchestra and organ blend to perfection the soloists to a letter the finest group i have ever heard there s a distinctly slavic sound that seems altogether appropriate given mahler s bohemian roots and a refreshing lack of self importance no operatic grandstanding here and for the first time ever i felt as though i was missing something by not following the words no libretto is provided though it is available online and can be found easily enough elsewhere because everyone sounded like they cared dearly about what they were singing they weren t going through the motions making pretty sounds they had something imperative to communicate and wanted us to know it to be honest part ii has often bored me to tears with chailly s performance being particularly offensive in this regard but here i was literally on the edge of my seat throughout impatient to hear what and who came next and throughout it all so importantly there was a sense of spiritual ascent from beginning to end the choruses easily the best i ve ever heard the way they rip into hostem repellas longius with their shrieks in the great double fugue of part i is unforgettable and the fugue itself which has never reminded me more of the rabble section from the first movement of mahler s third literally had my spine tingling throughout its entire course that s nothing i got chills right at the beginning of the chorus mysticus and six and a half minutes later they had not abated i have never experienced anything like that before ever and i don t just mean while listening to music the conductor what can i say he holds the symphony together with a tautness and logic that nobody ever credited this work with having before how i have no idea but when the start of part ii doesn t jar as it usually does you know you re in for something special maybe it s because the orchestral prelude there seems faster than usual or because he finds so much inwardness in the first part the first entry of the soloists for instance is so raptly caressing the orchestra while they don t have the mahler sound that the concertgebouw or vienna philharmonic may produce there s an earthiness but never sloppiness that sets them far apart from the bleached sterile sound of too many american orchestras that make mahler sound not like mahler to sum up then i could not speak for an hour after hearing this recording and still burst into tears at the mere thought of it especially those radiant visionary and extraordinary closing pages record of the year record of the century it crowns not merely my mahler collection but an entire lifetime of listening to great music
0,the upper portion of the boots which is supposed to hug your calf is ridiculously huge the shoe portion fit i have relatively normal sized calves and i was swimming in these boots i immediately returned tham
1,this cd is great it is a must have picture yourself in the wild or on a lake in a boat and a thunderstorm comes rolling in slowly you hear the rain the thunder in the distance you sense the storm getting closer the storm is over head loud piercing thunder claps and you duck for cover the thunderstorm slowly moves out but the rain is a constant presents the thunder rolls on but the wild life moves in bullfrogs owls in the distance all the animals are alive now this cd is all in one the real deal it is not all thunder i love it i also bought thunderstorm rykodisc this was a waste of money to me in my opinion it sounds like the storm just knocked the cable out static and more static
0,it may say slow cooker on the front of the item but i assure you it is anything but slow i was looking for a crock pot for camping using propane and was told this was the item for me so i made my hungarian ghoulash in it glad that the night meal would be done in hours when we got back from the beach all i can say is thank goodness my husband noticed that it was bubbling inside of the cooker a half hour later or we wouldn t have had anything but charcoal left had we left the campsite that day without checking it it was cooking on low and it was literally done in a half hour s time so keep in mind if you are camping and you haven t tried using this product yet it won t take long before your meal is done sadly my crock pot recipes were put away for the rest of that trip the campground we were at didn t have electricity hence why i wanted a propane crock pot
0,i ve been using this mat for a little over a month for a day a week practice at first i was thrilled but at the end of my class i noticed it was looking a little rough where i placed my feet it s continued to get worse and worse of little pieces of mat come off during practice and scatter on the floor around me since i practice in a studio it s particularly annoying i practice with the sticky side down and the jute side up the jute side is the side that flakes practicing with the jute side down stops the flaking problem but then the mat inchworms across the floor
0,i used to think this film was okay but it s really lame he s going home only cause he wants a car shows you how greedy people in america are about christmas they only care about the material goods they get out of the overrated season
1,this review will focus on the specs since there is minimal information available unless you buy the bike first off this is my second mongoose i started out on a crappy low end cruiser model so anything even half a step up from that model is a vast improvement the theory weighs about lbs and is actually light grey in color despite the image on this website i thought i was getting a white bike and i m a little ticked it s actually grey but whateva assembly isn t too bad as long as you have half a clue as to what you re doing the documentation is adequate but don t expect to be able to assemble this bike correctly if you haven t done it before the documentation will frustrate you but the average person can probably install the pedals and the saddle and maybe even mount the handlbars correctly assuming the brakes don t arrive screwed up like mine did the front cable had to be relocated because when it was assembled at the plant it was threaded immediately under the fork and the tire was rubbing against it so it had to be removed and resituated which entailed messing with the front cable simple enough i suppose but this assumes you know what you re doing i couldn t install the front tire correctly because of the disc brake and wanting to be safe instead of stupid i took the bike to an lbs and had them install it it was then that i found out one of the disc pads was missing no problem i just went back home and found it in the box apparently it had become dislodged from the housing on the front tire during transit i didn t even know it was there because i haven t worked with disc pads before it was a good thing i didn t toss the box right away otherwise i would have been sol just be advised however that if you are missing one or both disc pads and do toss out the box before you realize one of the pads is missing depending on where you are you may or may not be able to find replacement pads you may end up having to upgrade to a better brand disc brake now onto the specs the front disc brake is promax brand dsk which in the world of mtn biking is the generic low end i had to do some digging around on the web to find the following site because you won t find a website it wasn t really all that much more helpful and did not help me to understand disc brakes any better but at least you ll have a better idea what to look for the documentation on the site have color images vs the black and white images that come enclosed with the bike go here instead i wouldn t call the promax disc brake crap but close enough note if you plan on doing any kind of semi serious mtn biking as in on a trail considered intermediate level then upgrade the disc brakes and if you re planning a real mtn biking trip with rocks and logs and the whole nine then the theory can probably handle it just don t expect miracles as to the gears there are shimano flavored and they work flawlessly they re a pleasure to have because there isn t the usual slipping and dragging you see on lower end mongoose mtn bikes the only problem i had was the upper gears don t seem to want to shift into any gear definitely unless you downshift say to then upshift to for example and so forth for the others if you want then go to then upshift and vice versa this may or may not be because the cogs need to be lubed as to the ride the theory is a dual suspension bike and you can really feel the difference vs a hard tail bike wow just riding on the street and going over speed bumps and rain gulleys is amazing you have very little to no shock at all because the suspension absorbs it overall this bike is good bang for the buck but i wouldn t pay over tops for it if you re going to go that high you can get something else with higher end parts oh one last thing if you value your reproductive organs and don t want to find yourself numb from package to exit and or sitting on a bag of frozen peas for a week after using the bike then do yourself a favor and switch out the saddle the one that comes with the theory is horrible get a thicker padded gel lined split saddle instead
1,i really enjoyed this film basically the coen bros homage to the film noir genre i always thought the name was funny since it s french and yet most of famous directors were german like fritz lang otto preminger etc the sure hand of the brothers with this material is shown in how the film unfolds with the cool unhurried nonchalant pace of an experienced private eye or gumshoe doggedly stalking his prey thornton is great in the lead as the reticent phlegmatic barber and if anything he is even more convincing with hair than without even his hairpiece is ish the whole cast does a fine job in their roles and both gandolfini and shaloub have a couple of show stealing scenes i found the film s climax a complete surprise as the tables turn unexpectedly on the barber for whom everything seems to be working out up till then overall a great film and probably one of the coen bros best if you re a coen bros fan you won t find this one a disappointment
0,my son now loves cars so when i saw this bed frame i thought this is it well looks can fool you i also read many glowing reviews about this bed frame so i was confident that this was a must buy but after using it for a while year now i am very disappointed if i would buy another bed frame this one would not be in my shopping list what i and all my family don t like about this frame the front end of the car frame is shaped like a sports car so people hit that protruding part all the time when walking in the room making people falter sometimes since it is made of plastic it gets really cold and it really feels terrible i don t know why it is damn cold all the time i had to exchange the regular height box spring for a half height one because the regular height box spring would be too high and the sides of the bed frame would not provide adequate protection against falling so many toys and things fall between the mattress and the bed frame i have to lift the damn mattress and then go into the car frame to pick up all the junk that my son loves to shove into the little openings i think the bed frame takes up way too much space for a twin sized bed it is waste of space my son was disappointed that the wheels don t spin and i think he has a point since this bed frame costs so much my son now don t even think it s a cool thing well he stopped liking the bed only after a few days the head part of the bed is also plastic and for some reason your head can go under that plastic because that head part comes over the mattress it is quite annoying and we had to put another pillow to cover that part of the frame and you can t even use it as a shelf since it is not flat dolls and little toys that we put up there would slide down to hit our son or slide to the sides and fall into the corner where there is a big opening between the walls and the car frame again it is very very cold and it really feels terrible when you want to sleep at night and everything around you is so cold and hard this is a miserable bed and i feel bad that i bought this horrible bed for my loving son we are gonna sell it for dollars we hope in the summer the only reason for giving stars is because it is very solid
1,this product removed overspray in about two hours and saved me a ton of money i was lucky to find out about this system and highly recommend it it s easy to use just wash and dry your car and then in feet blocks spray the lubricant and gently rub the clay bar on your car wiping off excess lubricant and finishing with the wax included in the kit my car looks like it did when it came off the lot couldn t be happier
0,falling in love is one of my favorite scents ever it s basically my go to fragrance for everyday if you re a fan of this scent you already know it s really pretty but very light that s why i was exited about the solid for touch ups on the go let me tell you subtle is an understatement for this product when i opened the seal and held it under my nose i could hardly smell it when i applied it generously to my wrist the scent was barely detectable i rubbed my wrists together to gently warm the perfume and it didn t help at all i expected this to be fairly concentrated so that little dabs would suffice very disappointing
0,i just used this product in a bath it s supposed to be a cinnamon smelling bubble bath shampoo rinse shower gel well first of all i almost had to swallow my own lungs to smell any cinnamon this is really weak smelling i am a real scent meister too i used it as a bubble bath guess what the bubbles were gone within minutes stick with the avon bubble bath it still has bubbles in the tub when you are done then i used it as a shampoo guess what it didn t lather i ended up using the trusty suave to finish the bath very disapointing product i bought the for myself as a christmas present can t wait till it s gone
1,running times true to its roots is focused on performance worth the price alone for pete pfitzinger s lab report series and the owner s manual sections if you want to be a better runner at any level this magazine is invaluable if you want to understand physiology and kinesiology you ll find no other resource like running times and if you are interested in the sport of running the stats and biographies are crucial and are a much needed spotlight on our sport s heroes like a true athlete running times eschews junk and filler for focus
1,for its time and price at the time a fantastic camera mp is more than sufficient for most amateur and semi pro non studio work and this camera works very well with what really matters canon s fantastic lenses battery life on this camera is very good the shutter lag between when you depress the button and when the camera actually takes a photo is fairly well non existent and the only real lag i have is when i am shooting multiple photos in raw format as most photographers know the lens is almost more important than the body and outside of leica lenses i don t think anything really competes with canon s line the lens that comes with this camera is sufficient for casual work i used it at the beach and on hikes with my dog when i don t want to lug around my bigger more expensive higher quality lenses but for or so you can have a eos lens which will supplement the nicely particularly for night photography my one complaint about this camera is its ability to meter light adequately in dark settings when i shoot raw this isn t such a big problem because i can fix it in photoshop but most everything i shoot inside unless i manually mess with the white balance every time has an orange tint that is interesting for the first shots and then is annoying after i think the more advanced eos models that have come out since or so fix this color problem and also help a bit with the lag between the raw shots but for the money this camera is excellent and far far superior to for example olympus digital exquivalent for a similar price the difference as far as i m concerned is in the absolute advantage canon has in lens quality you can use a high end consumer body like this one use a professional piece of canon glass lens and take excellent photos i wouldn t invest in a system that doesn t also boast excellent lens quality
0,computer brain sent the wrong product right before xmas so the present that i intended had to be shipped back and it is jan and i am still awaiting the right one so i don t even know what the product is actually like yet
0,this seat does not fit in any snap and go stroller and is not exceptionally light if i were to do this over i would buy a different infant seat
1,the only problem that i had was loading the actual program on the three computers that i have you had to delete your old norton antivirus before starting also i have one more problem that after i loaded the norton antivirus users on the last computer i still get a error that i need to down load the latest updates which i already did
0,i wasn t expecting disney but i was less than thrilled by this feature i m assuming there s a genera of animation produced in the mid s that took the whole stoner heavy metal thing and ran with it many many long drawn out scenes with rock music and psychedelic colors that did nothing for the story i am an animation junkie and will watch anything and everything but i couldn t get through this whole film
1,i ve had this camera for about years now and it s been a tried and true companion i ve easily taken over shots with it and produced some really exceptional photographs the features that really set this camera apart are the zoom the image stabilization a must with such a large zoom and the rotating screen great if you want to take a picture of yourself i also love the macro mode i ve gotten some great quality close ups for most situations you can just stick it in auto mode and get great results but the different scene modes are fun to play with as well performs extremely well outdoors wildlife sports landscape beach etc my only real complaint is its performance in low light situations pictures are grainy and the camera is very slow to respond sometimes not responding at all also it can eat through batteries fairly quickly regular aa batteries lasted me about hours of continuous shooting around pictures or less if i was shooting in cold weather i would definately recommend rechargable batteries overall i ve really enjoyed this camera i ve used and abused it and apart from low light situations which i was rarely in anyway it never let me down both my grandmother and my great aunt bought one within the past months and they rave about it
0,i had read with delight the book called mrs frisby and the rats of nimh to my grandsons so i thought the movie would be a nice followup wrong it barely resembles the book and all the most important parts are glossed over or left out it might be ok for a child who hasn t read the book but we were disappointed
0,dude this looks cool but plays crappy pretty cheap plastic mechanics are lame you cant really tell when superman is hit because his head barely leans back you have to constantly adjust the arm positions of the figures so their reach can strike the head or chest targets and it seems rigged that supermans arms are just a little longer to stack the odds for truth justice and the american way again cool figures weak cheap playability
1,i previously wrote a review for this and only gave it stars but after watching it again i realized i liked it better i do agree with the reviewer below me in that it does grow on you i do not consider all of the performances goth martiya possesion are more tribal than anything at least on this video and i really dislike the expression or lack thereof on their faces while they are dancing they either look completely bored pissed off or smug i skip right over it i also did not care for asharah s dance to the drum solo by solace opaque the dance mood does not match the mood of the music at all the music is saying fast big upbeat and she s standing there doing taxim moves and small quick moves and of course we all love the s m piece excuse me s m is not part of the goth subculture and has no place on a bellydance video jehan may be a great and accomplished dancer but she didn t dance much on this and i didn t want to see what was on her part another thing i would have liked to see is more goth music i like solace and all but there were a lot of songs by them on this video and it would have been nice to see some more pieces done to music from the goth genre there were a few but not enough for my liking my favorites on this video were tempest ariellah jeniviva and ayshe for wierdness factor for all of its faults this is a good video to be inspired by and i will use it for that purpose
0,i am in great shape however i cannot get over that so many men s underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension obviously they are made in china where the average waist is about inches the idea of medium as marketed is ridiculous by healthy american standards my body fat is low i am not profoundly muscular bound as is common in men of my age lower back problems are not unusual i have a waist is that not medium sized i think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether one size fits all doesn t work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems the draw string is fine it allows flexibility so what if your pants fall down it seems to be the fashion anyway just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary uncontrollable constrictions also these boxers don t hold up well to any kind of washing they looked like crap after the first time i washed them i wish i could get a refund because i won t wear them again my life partner told me they looked like old men s underwear that is sad and embarrassing because i agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry i am not a mean hearted kind of guy so i am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again
1,very good product you do need to use help menue for instructions because the paperwork that comes with it doesn t tell you a lot overall i m having fun using this product
1,i am a huge fan of tea i have been drinking this one for years i am astonished at the price such a great deal anyway if you must buy tea in a box this is one to purchase i love the subtle flavors of this tea i always feel better after drinking a cup it s even better if you add a little fresh organic lemon juice
0,when you buy natori you expect the best but this product just isn t up to their usual high standard most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings for dollars they should be awesome they aren t my favorite panty right now is a nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about bucks i haven t seen them online but this is worth a trip to the store
1,i ve owned sets of these types of phone systems a ge set and a gig uniden set this is by far the best actually it s perfect no noise on the line at all everything just works perfectly only one caution this particular model does not have an answering machine i was moving too fast when i bought and thought that it did if you want an answering machine to come with make sure you buy the right model i m totally sold on the dect buy it you won t regret it
1,i m not a big fan of the diablo d d typr game but this game is really neat the one big advantage of this game over diablo is the ability to control characters in one game very high replay value also makes this game a winner pick up a copy if you can i ve seen it rather inexpensive at local retail store for the price you can t go wrong
1,these shoes are adorable and perfect for summer i love mine the only negative thing is that they are wide i have normal size feet and ordered my regular shoe size they fit length wise but are very spacey width wise
1,annie sprinkles very personal heart felt spectacular sex guide inspires us into our sexual potential giving us the tools for sexual transformation even if we already have a satisfying sex life there are many interesting exercises here to try i can relate to annie s libraries of sexual experience even though i have not taken as many adventures as her really folks if some of us turned off our tvs and used that time to further our sexual awareness there would be a great possibility for personal sexual freedom my favorite quote would be don t worry be horny now that this wonderful book has been put on sale there couldn t be a better time to buy it
0,the kid who wrote the star reveiw is wrong he needs to go to preschool first the pagages arent free if they didnt come w the maker no one would buy it second this kid says it cant get any better but it cant get any worse the star reveiws say to go to mc donalds if you want a mc flurry but dont go there and support them thats just what they want you to do so they can earn more money go to dq or just make one yourself do not waste your money on this peice of junk
1,it worked much better than expected the page clips also were very good but one fell off about minutes into owning using the item i put it back on but fell off a couple more times i also get the feeling that the other parts are fragile as well
0,perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe s insert but i hated it it felt half there there was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front like those orthotic deals that come on infomercials well it didn t feel good on my tender forefoot so i sent them back on the other hand the shoe looked great i guess if you really want it shoe can go shopping for some dr scholl s
0,first here are some general positives about jaci velasquez she is a very gifted singer her vocal range is top notch definitely on par with mariah carey and christina aguilera she is beautiful and unlike a previous reviewer i do not consider the recognition of this attribute to be a sign of shallowness but rather a display of appreciation for feminine beauty i like beautiful singing voices i like beautiful women there s no difference she has great spiritual depth her music reflects key spiritual themes such as love faith and joy now here s a critique of the cd i listened to all the music samples as you can do as well and only one song caught my attention lay it down the other tracks have too much of a hard rock sound and were too experimental for my taste but the song lay it down was different it sounded more acoustic more in the style of folk rock a genre that reflects my personal preference in pop music i found the sound clip of lay it down to be intriguing because it reminded me of a hit song in the s eric carmen s all by myself later covered by celine dion in all by myself is a ballad having a soft understated introductory verse with an explosive chorus the sample clip of lay it down appears to be in the same mold it has a soft understated introductory verse however it seems to lack an explosive chorus listen to the sample and hear it for yourself the introductory verse is closing with the following lyrics all of my hopes and my dreams and my best laid plans are slowly slipping through my folded hands so far so good there s only a piano and a violin accompanying jaci s soft vocals next the song appears to be moving from the verse to the chorus and you hear the following lyrics so i m gonna lay it down i m gonna learn to trust you now now here s a problem i am expecting to hear the beginning of an emotional outburst an opportunity for a singer with the pipes of jaci velasquez to showcase her voice but it is not forthcoming why this intrigued me and i wanted to hear the whole song but i did not want to purchase a cd for only one song luckily i discovered that a compilation cd of jaci velasquez s best songs was released recently and it contained lay it down great i bought the cd on my knees the best of jaci velasquez this is what i discovered after listening to lay it down the first time through the verse and the chorus the song is definitely understated we simply have the accompaninment of a piano and a violin with jaci s soft vocals the second time through the verse and the chorus a drum beat is introduced and jaci begins to let some emotion out beginning in the middle of the verse and when the song moves into the chorus a complete emotional outburst occurs but somewhat to my dismay this is not the same voice that i am expecting from jaci velasquez her voice was more raspy and raw actually it was sounding more like demi moore or tara reid not that that is necessarily bad furthermore she appeared to be struggling is this the same voice that was soaring effortlessly through the stratosphere on songs such as on my knees speak for me and adore is jaci velasquez losing her voice i don t know but i find it very difficult to imagine that a young woman in her mid s is losing her voice she is entering her prime barring a health issue this just doesn t happen lay it down is actually a pretty good song in fact i am almost of the opinion that it may be her best i certainly find myself listening to this song more than any of her others lay it down has the same message as the beatles classic let it be the words are different but both songs share the same sentiment actually now that i think of it they do share a couple of words in common the words let it be here are the closing lyrics i m gonna let it be i m gonna let it go i m gonna lay it down the essential lesson being conveyed is learning to let go and let god a profound spiritual insight something that each of us here is learning this song is heartfelt and gut wrenching and though her voice is struggling through it the song nevertheless works out its magic i gave this cd stars because i think jaci velasquez is attempting to redefine her music style and has not succeeded interestingly enough her best sound was her first cd un lugar celestial a heavenly place bring back the spanish flamenco guitar and develop a more acoustic sound in my opinion the acoustic sound is more spiritual keep the piano and electric bass guitar but dispense with the hard rock electric guitar and synthesized sound effects develop a latin folk rock sound with an element of jazz hire a good saxophonist or a trumpet player emphasize ballads that should do the trick
1,i like this because it tastes like drinking green iced tea it has a great taste and is not super sweet i find it refreshing and cleansing of the palate unlike the other person i am not addicted but am satisfied with one piece and that is what is great about so many asian candies if you like green tea i think you will like these i drink unsweatened tea all the time and this was like drinking it nice refreshing candy individually wrapped like many japanese candies and that makes it easy to eat over time
1,this film s predecessor ginger snaps unleashed was a competent but uninspired effort a typical sequel in contrast ginger snaps back is a significant film but hardly a sequel at all the first two ginger snaps installments took place in contemporary canada mainly in suburbs and city but ginger snaps back is set in the canadian frontier wilderness of nearly years ago furthermore in the earlier films particularly the first the two sisters brigitte and ginger share a complex relationship loving but mutually antagonistic ginger s cynical death wish keeps her at odds with brigitte who would stay alive and human at any cost in ginger snaps back however the girls have been simplified they ve become fairy tale orphans wandering through a monster infested forest early on in the film the sisters find shelter in a militaristic fort outpost run by some very hard guys misfit toughs who resemble ogres just waiting for victims to approach their lonely castle significantly it s in this dubious refuge that ginger is infected with lycanthropy thus with monsters lurking outside the gates as well as within the film plunges toward a fiery but despairing climax overall ginger snaps back conveys a thrilling atmosphere of folklore and legends an ancient eeriness more easily felt than described even the film s snow covered forests radiate a sense of centuries old indian myths appropriately the film s indian characters including a larger than life hunter warrior identify the werewolves with the wendigo as a work of folklore or fairy tale ginger snaps back tends to be less verbal but more visionary than the preceding films in this trilogy startling beautiful images abound in this movie just one example lovely ginger in her black hooded cloak with vamp fangs and raptor claws flinging open the gates of the fort to admit the besieging werewolves as the creatures surge forward and around her ginger stands as an icon of demonic ecstasy comparable to the robot doppelganger in fritz lang s great metropolis of course that comparison alone should indicate the imaginative power flowing through ginger snaps back
0,it is a great disappointment with amazon when it pushed to sell a product replacement inner blade and outer foil combination for pro curve linear shavers without indicating that they are not compatible with the panasonic pro curve elite convex wet dry shaver i purchased amazon displaced those two products next to each other as though if i made a purchase those products together i would save money now i was forced to buy one more shaver that would be compatible with replacement
0,i ordered two of these for the first one neither the firewire nor the usb worked on my imac macos a copy would start and then hang after a while i returned it and the second one worked using usb but the firewire would hang like the first one a friend has one that works fine with his ibook under
0,i picked up an issue of this magazine last week because i wanted to take the picture of the cover girl into my hair dresser after i got it home i opened it up to check it out and discovered it is the most brainless magazine i have ever seen the articles read like something from teen beat yet it s filled with adult material there were about articles on how to please your man and what guys like and even a sex workout these articles didn t contain any real advice just unintelligent babble for instance did any of you know that guys don t like it when you act unenthusiastic during sex hmmm crazy anyway i don t see how anyone over the age of could find any of this stimulating and yet there are too many articles about one night stands for anyone under to read but if you re still into taking quizzes and looking at half naked hunks who have barely hit puberty then this magazine is perfect i would have given this magazine stars but unfortunately it s not an option
0,i ordered the smack and yack disney cars sally lightning and ramone for christmas the only one of them that worked consistently after a few minutes was ramone sally and lightning only worked sporadically after a few minutes and then after about an hour they wouldn t work at all i ended up having to order the same ones again because my daughter was so upset that they stopped working on christmas i hope the new ones work for a longer time than the orginal purchases
1,this is my favorite sheet for our daughter s crib it is a soft knit material and it washes up so well it fits easily onto the matress and i have never had a problem with it coming loose it is also such an adorable print
0,upon purchasing this product i d hoped it would be equivilant to the product i normally purchase at the salon i was horribly disappointed it was nothing at all like the typical product rather much more like water the normal scent was not present the product made my hair greasy and my head itched all day long i would very much like to return this it s not at all the same product that is purchased at the salon i was sorely disappointed
1,yes it is a very fine lens is and mm long end are also appealing but after buying this i decided to sell it in favour of my ef after weeks of usage makes clearly the autofocus slower and fuzzier bokeh is also worse than the other one the viewfinder gets darker in crop bodies mm does make a very little difference in image size plus the macro option is weaker on this one if you don t care about the weight go with the ef imho
1,oddly the i received is actually a what a steal at the watch is a star based on price alone but the jubilee bracelet gets a star it s cheap feeling and loose the center links are fold over not solid at this price though it s not surprising that something got cheaped out like that overall i give it a star rating missing tag false advertising perhaps to the benefit as the is perceived a little better that it s really a rather than a has singapore labeling on lower edge of dialface whereas the does not have any country markings great buy for sure cheers
1,due to the room layout i needed a double bed rail that would protect both sides of the bed we don t live near a store that has a lot of choices and after reading many online product descriptions decided that we were going to need to look at several of these in person and then decide which one best fit our needs so we purchased brands of bed rails after looking at the more detailed information on the box and trying two of them out we decided to keep the safe and secure double bedrail by the first years to help others i have attached two customer s photos to this product description these photos are sketches and photos from the side of the box that better describe the bed rail why amazon target can t get a least as much information on their website than is on the side of the box is frustrating to me but that seems to happen many times this bedrail took about minutes to assemble the side panels and another minutes to fully assemble the unit to the bed this is in line with the time that the other model we tried out took the reasons why we liked this bed rail the best are as follows it is a double bed rail and is designed to protect both sides of the bed this was the only model we looked at where both sides folded down making mattress pad and sheet changes feasible the quality of the construction especially of the spring loaded locking pins was much better than that of the sleeptite bed rail we looked at from regalo and one step ahead which is also made by regalo the design made more sense than the regalo the installation was more straightforward possible issues with this bed rail are as follows it is only high so measure your mattress and make sure that it will fit in our case our mattress was not a pillowtop and is about high depending on where you measure it so we were still satisfied with the height of the rail above our mattress but i could see where if you had a tall mattress this would be an issue this was the easiest rail to pull up to unlock and fold down others had more substantial locking mechanisms i could see where a toddler who watched you do this could then do it himself so we are planning on not doing this in front of our toddler only during sheet changes only you know how inquisitive your own child is about these things and how much of a problem this would be despite these two issues we decided that the good points outweighed the bad and that this bedrail was the best choice for us however if we are later disappointed with this bed rail i will go and update our review
0,got the bodybare and the ladyfair combo the ladyfair is cheap and poorly made it pulls as much hair as it cuts plus it cuts the skin the bodybare does nothing at all it s so weak and delicate that it won t cut anything don t waste your money
0,my experience has been similar to that of other reviewers the one movable positioner secures very loosely with a small piece of velcro my two week old daughter managed to slide down in between the positioners and had her face against one of them when i checked her in the middle of the night honestly the only way a baby would stay on this thing is if they didn t move their arms so perhaps the designers had no children of their own
1,i remember seeing this movie years ago in college and have continued to like it ever since the movie starts off at the calgary olympics doug dorsey d b sweeny is a talented hockey player and kate mosley moira kelly is a pairs figure skater both have mishaps during their big moments doug suffering a career ending injury and kate falling during her performace and failing to meet her own expectations the movie picks up a few years later with kate having trouble getting a new partner and doug is on the skids unable to fulfill his dream of becoming a star hockey player added to the mix is kate s russian couch anton pamchenko played by the great roy dotrice who decides rick will be kate s new partner as they struggle to get back to the olympics at first glance this is a sports movie about figure skating but that is not entirely so the scenes involving the leads on the ice are surprisingly abstract as neither is a professional skater in truth this is a character driven story and most of the action takes place off the ice it is absolutely charming to watch the two lead characters go from a dislike of one another to extreme rivalry and finally ending up in love the thing that absolutely makes this happen is the chemestry between the leads sweeney and kelly they are magic together on the screen so much so that i am surprised they never paired up again for another movie i highly recommend this light hearted romance to everyone on a side note about the dvd the only special feature is the theatrical trailer there are no deleted scenes this is where i have a question because the version of the film on this dvd and that i ve scene on tv in recent years is not the one i remember seeing in college i distinctly remember the end scene was the medal ceremony i somewhat like that version because what doug and kate won in that version was so much more so where is the version with the alternative ending
0,don t pay amazon for this subscription when you can get it directly from national geographic for
1,this album is ridiculous i almost want to say part of srv s soul is in this guy he is that good honestly i think this album rips apart his previous two my hope is that jimmy dt and apo will bring out a release as good as this album or better this is one of those great albums where every song is good buy it you like srv buy it double trouble must have brought part of srv back because this album is just plain sweet
0,i didn t like these at all the toes are too pointy and wouldn t fit might be ok for younger children than stated
1,most of the other reviews printed here i am in agreement with there is little i need to add except that i saw the film for the first time in the eighties when it came out on tape i just rewatched it and still find my gut reaction to be the same and then some schlesinger s work the three leads and the marvelous script make for an engrossing sobering and disturbing treatise on how so many people lack values and seek happiness in all of the wrong places especially in the wrong people after the twenty odd years of first viewing this film i realized tonight how strong julie christie s performance is in this film there is not one hole in this bravura performance it s odd to make this statement especially since she s playing such a shallow role it s not an easy nor a desirable part to play but she carries it off as if she herself were the character selfishness is at the core of the character as well as immaturity and she stoops and conquers laurence harvey has never played the rogue better and dirk bogarde is perfect as the jilted lover who indeed possesses a heart but nevertheless gives in but not completely to ms christie s empty needs he indeed sees through her throughout most of the film but cannot help being swayed by her charms emptiness served up brilliantly and we must respect the talents involved for providing us with a lesson as well as thank them on two levels at least talent coupled with making us examine what should really be of value to us
0,you could make your own i bought these through a catalog for my year old last christmas he pretends they are leaf blowers if you find the sweet spot the tones are okay but finding that spot isn t easy too much money for not enough product

0,the chenille cover is very soft and nice to the touch however it does not allow for the cold from the gelpack to penetrate the star rating is only for using this product as a cold pack i had intended to use it as a cold mask only
0,i purchased these earphone to use for swimming with a otterbox and an ipod shuffle they are were very uncomfortable from the start but i could listen to music that didn t last long the connection would not hold and if i didn t hold it together the music faded out also music faded in and out from ear to ear i finally gave up and bought earbud waterproof earphones that have worked quite well and cost less
1,i ve had the battery for about a week now simply love it i m a heavy user of gps applications and power vision for web surfing on the go i used to charge the phone twice a day now i charge it once a day and sometimes i even forget to plug it in at night and i still have bars of battery left half way through the day even when i forget to charge it hasn t died on me this is a great deal at shipping vs the one sold at sprint stores for around
1,i bought the grill for father s day and found it a great purchase i ve been thinking about getting a new grill but forking over hundreds of dollars for a standup felt a bit much even though the price of the go anywhere grill is cheap it is pretty solid i ve only used it once so far but it works nicely i can fit ears of corn on the grill chicken wings or teriyaki beef skewers it took a few minutes to assemble the grill and is brain dead simple the best part is the portability i used it for the first time today and as the meat was starting to cook it started to rain thanks to the unpredictable northeast weather since the grill is portable i picked it up and moved to the garage try that with a standup grill i would gladly recomment the grill to friends and famil
1,this camera case fits the camera perfectly and the extra battery is a must the price of the two items together is the same as the battery alone in local electronics stores so i look at it as getting the case for free
1,this movie is one of my personal favorites and probably one of rob reiners best directionals masterpeices he hit the time the place and the kids perfectly this movie appealed to me as these kids were such good friends and ive never had a relationship that they all share i find that real friendship is something worth looking for and after about billoin cases of friends becoming eneimies for me this movie really pointed out to me that its the type of relationship and the way you fell with others that makes having frineds that best thing in the world i can only hope that i can find friends as good as these kids someday its a great movie and i d recommend it to anyone you might have to look past the constant crying and deep emotions since it might seem a little fake but thats what this movie is all about growing up and not many kids these days are willing to share how they feel with each other which isn t as bad as it sounds plus great script dialog and a great tone and atomashperehope then rest of you have noticed that aswell its also the only movie that made me realize that i wouldnt mind living in the s over this era
1,this upgrade installed easily with my photoshop no problems at all this is an excellent program and leap years ahead of my photoshop this is a much less expensive way to upgrade to rather than purchasing outright be sure to get the updates after you install the program

1,delivers moist heat great large size you won t find anything larger anywhere very relaxing as lavender is calming only problem is it only stay warm enough for min and heat really should be applied for minutes i have placed a heating pad underneath in it the last min and lied down with head neck in comfortable position and it did a great job pricey but worth it

1,the ny times book review linked this novel to the aftermath of but that may have more to do with the preoccupation of new yorkers than with the story powers wrote while he does refer to early on this book concerns environmentalism and species conservation versus wrong headed economic development in the great plains at the western edge of the midwestern farming belt it is about the struggle not to loose even more economic ground relative to the rest of america in a region that is being slowly drained of its population due to the changing scale of agricultural operations but since it is a richard powers novel it is also about much more neuro physiology brain function as reflected in behavior and personality the devotion of a sister to her less able younger brother her sexual relations with two very different men and a nationally known writer clearly modeled on oliver sachs who has a late mid life crisis it is about love devotion and doing as much of the right thing as one can do it involves escape and return clearly powers should not be considered a regional writer his books have been set entirely or partly in brooklyn manhattan philadelphia l a the pacific northwest and the continent of europe but several books by powers are set in the midwest where he is based readers who know something of the areas in which those stories are set will gain an extra measure of appreciation for the skillful way powers incorporates subtle regional characteristics into these novels as others have said this is probably not the best novel this writer has given us although it is quite carefully plotted and full of the marvelous insights we have come to expect from him i prefer the goldbug variations three farmers on their way to a dance and despite my own musical illiteracy in the time of our singing but even when powers is not quite at his best he writes a better book than most novelists ever manage ever to produce read enjoy learn
1,works like a charm the wi fi sniffer in the software is definitely a big plus you can get details of the connection i e connection strength ap name and etc worth every penny
0,the magnetic clasp is weak very weak making it vulnerable to thieves with sticky fingers or opening up on it s own i keep this camera case inside of my purse i wouldn t recommend this product there has to be something better
1,the developers of this game did a great job coming up with questions designed to appeal to kids questions like if you could star in a movie which movie would you choose if you could eat only one food for the rest of your life what would it be the questions range from simple to a bit more complex so that kids who like challenges as well as those who don t will enjoy the game another thing although you can follow the rules and play this strictly as a board game we used it while we were just sitting around the table having a casual chat sometimes the kids asked the question sometimes the adults did but we all learned more about one another a lot more and many of the questions got us talking about family history memories etc lots of fun it d be great to take the questions along on a trip or while eating at a restaurant since they are surefire conversation starters but not so personal that anyone s personal boundaries will be invaded plus there are no right or wrong answers and any information provided is strictly voluntary revealing as much or as little as the respondent wants one caveat you will eventually go through all the questions so this game won t last forever unless you are able to find new people to participate if so it be used for years in terms of fostering family closeness without any threatening or off limits questions in short everyone has to play nicely together this is great
0,donot buy it i got the stuff even past the expiration day
1,sometimes i feel like i ve been on a diet forever of course i haven t been i ve been on and off one or another then back again i don t believe any tea is a wonder cure for everything but i find tea helpful in managing my appetite my stress levels and outlook on life i drink this oolong tea really enjoy it and suspect it helps me feel less hungry in the midafternoon i ve heard it s rich in anti oxidants and promotes the burning of fat it may well be i ve lost bodyfat and weight but again i believe the result are due to a combination of factors that includes regular exercise counting calories and taking time to for a deep breath and a warm cuppa

0,going by the plantronics name i bought a pair of headsets to use on a cell and a miniphone they are incredibly cheaply made and when my wife gave them a try she got a nasty feedback squeal several times during a long call essentially unusable unless we find some trick that we have missed so far we ordered a sennheiser to try instead
0,this was the worst electronics puchase i ve ever made when i first got the mini it was great looked nice and sounded great within about months battery life started to go way down after a year it was down to nothing didn t work properly would show a full charge and not last more than minutes if you re going to take a chance on an ipod definitely get a newer different model that may be of better quality than this one
0,whoever decided this was good for four year olds must not be a parent of said age group my four year old received this as a birthday present his adult aunt could barely figure it out it s one of those toys that collapses the moment you play with it taking all the fun out of the imaginative play that should be occuring we have all the little parts and bigger pieces in a pile and he just walks around with the bigger piece wondering what to do with it even though we have the corresponding mystic force power rangers themselves i think this toy should be perhaps of the price listed simply disappointing
1,i would like to add to the reviews already posted especially for anyone considering this lens as an alternative to the vr this is one of the only times i can remember when i have had the money to buy a nikon lens but have not been able to bring myself to do it the is years old uses ancient mechanical slow focus and has yet to be updated with vrii technology all that and it still costs more than the pro quality canon is which has canon s af s equivalent too that said i like long yet portable lenses and after giving myself fits decided to settle for the because it has vrii and af s if you are in the same boat then buy this lens it is a gem for its intended purpose i get sharp results wide open at and the light weight more than offsets the slower apertures i would have loved this lens if it was an f but even at i have really been surprised at the results save the until nikon updates the dinosaur
1,i think this is a great product i enjoy the chocolate dip caramel dip and this marshmallow dip with fruit especially strawberries
1,we bought this when my daughter was newborn and we were surprised that her peg perego car seat fit into it so well now shes a year and a half and even if were at home she climbs into it and plays with the steering wheel she has always loved it in the snow and on the ground and on picnics its great a lot better than plastic wheels the front tire swivels and also has a little switch so that it becomes more like a jogging stroller and the front wheel doesnt move weve really liked it so far except for the harness not fitting a very tiny baby its great the only thing is now i have kids and i cant use it cause i need a double on
0,the spring on these tongs broke on first use in september this renders them largely useless i purchased the tongs after reading manufacturer assurances dated many months ago that the spring problem had been repaired despite this assurance i am here to tell you that a pair shipped recently is still defective i returned them and i cannot recommend these tongs
1,i bought this set for my year old we have had a great time putting it together on several occasions in the last couple of weeks once put together my son imagines adventures on it with the included soldiers i am not very mechanically inclined but the instructions are excellent well illustrated and clear and i had no problem with them my only quibble is that the orange sticks in the manual are a different shade of color from the ones in our set and took a moment to identify at first my son just wanted to put together the foam walls but the second time around he wanted to help constructing the walls of the castle by imitating me he was able to make duplicate versions of some simple structures rather well he also figured out how to make the soldiers all by himself with their arms legs helmets swords and shields through doing the set i also was able to explain that you have to build the foundation first before you can put in the walls and floors and the third time we made the castle he was repeating this point to me the drawbridge is really fun and well done it raises and lowers very smoothly this particular set is really only designed to make the castle so it s not really meant for making many different things like the other superstruct sets but this was our first one and i have no regrets assembly time was about minutes the first time but after you do it once it seems closer to minutes the pieces are high quality fit very well and are generally a joy to handle and see the castle looks great once assembled and will impress any adults or kids who see it
0,the sound is bad i have tried this dvd on different players and it made no difference

0,this product would be excellent but runs fully too narrow and too short this creates an aprox lip around the entire matress very odd this short coming disturbs the experience substantially the laminated back works well be sure to purchase the product sized for a bed size larger than the one you own and it should be fine
1,i bought this case for my lg chocolate and it is perfect the belt clip is very strong making accidental unclipping rare the pouch is made of reinforced leather and nylon which protect the phone from any impacts the front flap is also reinforced leather and is secured closed by two magnets the bottom of the case has a small hole for access to the chocolate s end button this allows you to silence calls without having to remove the phone from the case the only dislike i have is the name cellnet embossed on the front flap but this is not really a big deal i would recommend this case to anyone who owns a chocolate
1,gave this to my year old for his birthday i helped him to construct it from the clear no reading directions along with my year old daughter the pieces go together flawlessly the engineering of the plastic is superb the elevator works as designed and the battery pack connects via a short cord very convenient he has already spent many hours playing with it

0,received the package to discover a warning on the label that the product may contain wheat there is no allergy warning on amazon apparently if you are allergic you have to order the product to find out that you cannot eat it
1,this book contains the childhood memoirs of peter reich as the son of psychoanalyst wilhelm reich peter led a bizarre life he lived with his parents on the family estate of orgonon in the backwoods of maine not only did his father develop a unique form of psychotherapy but he also was a theorist who experimented with unknown forms of energy as wilhelm s only child peter was one of the first recipients of reich s therapy methods which involved special forms of touch energy channeling softening the stomach and inducing vomiting in peter s account peter was also made lieutenant in his father s defensive squad that protected the earth from ufo attacks through the use of accumulator guns the elder reich eventually got in trouble with the fda for manufacturing and promoting medical equipment without proper testing for safety and effectiveness the court case involving his work eventually landed him in jail through contempt of court not long after being sent to prison he passed away apparently of heart failure upon his father s death peter found himself at the tender age of forced to confront his father s legacy of brilliance and madness up until the time of his father s death he had believed everything his father told him not knowing enough of contemporary scientific theories to understand how different his father s version of reality was from most other people s nor having established an identity of his own through which he could objectively choose between his father s explanations and standard scientific approaches in this book peter tries to sort out for himself what is real and what is not what is his and what is his father s the book reads like the proverbial onion chapters move in a dreamlike fashion from one period of time to another sometimes it s hard to tell if what peter is describing actually took place or whether it was all an imaginative game in his head by the end of the book the reader will have some inkling of the confusion in peter s mind but like peter may not be capable of saying what really happened in any case this is very much a book about peter reich and not wilhelm reich although readers who want to learn more about wilhelm reich may find some clues to his ideas through the interpretation of his son who experienced them first hand and without question
1,plus minutes of recording time without lcd i still got several hours with the lcd backlight on for when you are out all day this is a good long lasting battery on the hdr i found it preferable to the smaller and lighter battery as it helped provide a touch extra rear weighting that helped balance when using the camcorder at hip height for me i can t say i noticed the extra weight as an issue when using at shoulder height though i didn t have it on my shoulder for long periods at a time
0,very dissappointed my son i bought this for them hooked it up and there is so much interference it cannot be used audio just static and noise i did find it interesting that the instructions tell you it might not work try telling this to me before i purchase thank you this is the last i purchase equipment on line i will stick to books thank you very much

1,i bought this game for my year old last winter because he loved the book so much he quickly mastered the game which requires you to earn state cards by recognizing certain items about each state such as the color of the card whether the capital starts with a certain letter or if the state nickname has a person s name embedded in it all his friends liked the game when they came over so i ended up buying and giving at least more as birthday presents for his friends and for a niece and nephew but more than that this game has spawned a further interest in geography in my son he began playing with a wooden puzzle of the usa as a result of the information on the game cards in doing so he taught himself most of the capitals which are also on the game cards and the shapes of the various states he continues to want to learn more about us geography i highly recommend the book and game for ages and up

1,this film motivated me to do my own research and i read as much material on the case as i could possibly find especially arguments from those who maintained that the three teenagers are guilty to be honest i had a natural skepticism about the west memphis three s claims of innocence a coworker of mine was brutally murdered some years ago and two of her friends who were also coworkers were arrested for the murder i refused to believe it at first but it became clear over time that the evidence was overwhelming and conclusive still there were those who refused to believe the facts and zealously argued their friends innocence when all is done and said it does come down to facts and whether or not one chooses to face reality and believe facts first please allow me to correct a few misconceptions from some of the other reviewers the michael moore mentioned in the credits refers to one of the little eight year old child murder victims not the filmmaker a couple of reviewers mentioned a necklace worn by damien echols which supposedly had blood on it from some of the victims actually nothing more determinable than common blood types was found one almost microscopic spot on the pendant was consistent with the blood type of damien echols one of the accused the other micro spot was consistent with the blood type shared by both jason baldwin one of the accused and steven branch one of the eight year old victims as well as of the rest of the caucasian population of the united states all experts agree that tiny micro spots of blood can be transferred by a number of ways especially a teenage boy wearing the necklace against their bare skin police photos verify that jason baldwin had also worn damien s necklace police photos taken two days after the crime show damien without his shirt and reveal absolutely no cuts abrasions or scratches whatsoever the closest thing to credible evidence the prosecution could manage to produce were four very tiny fibers found in the houses of damien s family and jason s family which were deemed by the prosecution to be microscopically similar to fibers from two of the victims but even the prosecution s expert witness lisa sakevicius a criminologist from the state s crime laboratory acknowledged that this was inconclusive and could have just as well come from mass produced products obtained off the shelves of the local wal mart furthermore charles linch of the southwestern institute of forensic science in dallas refuted the claims of microscopic similarities in his testimony no fibers whatsoever were found in the home of jessie s family during the appeal process forensic scientists examining the crime scene photos and autopsy photos identified human bite marks on two of the victims this was confirmed by a forensic odontologist teeth impressions were taken from the three young men in prison none of these teeth impressions from damien jason and jessie matched these bite marks found on the victims the highly coerced confession from jessie misskelly jr a year old borderline retarded boy with an iq of was so filled with obvious errors that it is an obscenity that it was treated as the basis for making these arrest i should mention that this so called confession came after submitting this boy to a hour grueling without lawyers parents or counsel of any kind and included a polygraph test which he had passed but was told by the police that he had failed judge burnett would not allow the jury to hear about these interrogation techniques jessie misskelly jr refused to testify in court against jason baldwin and damien echols stating that he simply was not going to get up there and tell a bunch of lies this was in spite of an offer to remove his life sentence read dan stidham s jessie s lawyer case synopsis by copying and pasting the web address below http www org live caseintroduction synopsis dan php the scenario painted by the police and the prosecutors against the three teenagers is simply a scientific impossibility how on earth could there have been the massive blood loss caused by ceremonial satanic cult killings of three persons in the middle of the night without leaving one single micro speck of blood or any other body fluids at the scene did they sneak in the fbi forensic team to clean up after them when nobody was looking luminal testing could reveal blood presence only where the police had laid or transported the bodies it should also be mentioned that none of the scarce shoe prints at the scene matched jason jessie or damien either for a scientific view see this crime scene analysis and profile by one of america s leading forensic scientist which also gives some insight on who might have actually committed the crime i must warn you it is a bit gruesome to say the least copy and paste this web address http www arwar org turveyequivocaldeathanalysisandprofile html so let us briefly summarize much of the so called evidence was based on the notion that damien admitted an interest in the wicca religion and the occult which many local people perceived as satanism this is not evidence of committing murder you can go to any suburban shopping mall bookstore or small town library anywhere in middle america and find plenty of books on such subjects furthermore neither jason nor jessie had ever expressed any particular interest in wicca or the occult both damien and jason wore mostly black clothes and loved heavy metal music so what the police actually confiscated black t shirts from jason s home as evidence to prove god knows what damien was undoubtedly a troubled teenager from a troubled family he was a bit of a wise ass teenager he wrote some morbid poetry so what a couple of young girls claimed months after the fact that they had heard damien say that he committed the murders any reasonable objective person listening to those testimonies would have found them implausible to put it politely a young burglar drug addict who was in the juvenile detention facility claimed that the shy and reserved year old jason confessed to him the second time they ever met ghastly stories about drinking blood from the genitals of a murdered child while worshipping the devil the counselor from that facility warned the prosecution that this young man was not credible and gave them detailed reasons and there is no evidence that jason and this young man ever met even if they did the story is ridiculous still judge burnett would not allow the jury to hear counter testimony or information that could have challenged the credibility of this witness the so called confession of jessie and the scenario put forward by the police and prosecution would have involved massive amounts of blood left at the scene there was not even one tiny micro spec that is a physical impossibility the simple fact is all forensics were either exonerating or completely inconclusive there was a lack of physical evidence to tie anyone or anything to the crime scene john fogleman prosecutor of the west memphis three sadly the west memphis police would not do anything more than a cursory and disinterested investigation of the most obvious suspect see the forensic profile mentioned above probably because that obvious suspect who had a violent history including family violence and a lifetime as a penny anny career criminal was also an undercover narcotic informant who was in a very tight relationship with the west memphis police anyway for god sakes see this film along with paradise lost and read devils knot this is not a political film this case has nothing to do with being liberal or conservative democrat or republican left or right or even whether you support or oppose the death penalty i hope that we of all political persuasion agree that locking up the wrong people and letting the real killers get away is a very bad idea for an in depth analysis of all details of this case see these two websites and if it touches your conscience

0,i truly wanted to like this book after years of avoidance i had just finished moby dick and found it not only more readable than i d feared but downright enjoyable in addition i d heard nothing but good things about this novel whose premise certainly intrigued me and like its predecessor it has one of the truly great opening lines in literature captain ahab was neither my first husband nor my last alas it was all down hill from there overall this is one of the worst books i ve ever forced myself to finish this came as quite a surprise because the author is no untalented hack author of two other published novels and a short story collection director of a university level creative writing program long term teacher of writing and holder of a ph d in same all to considerable critical acclaim she should be correcting and grading failing garbage like this not producing it so what went wrong how did this novel end up so awful the answer is brick by brick and piece by piece there is no one great thing wrong with it but rather a lot of little things length if brevity is the soul of wit this novel s witlessness is easily explained at pages interesting number that this novel is about three times as long as it should have been it would seem that to some extent like melville before her naslund confused length with importance but melville was a lot more skilled at padding than she is imho this desire to fill too many pages made many of the other problems worse by allowing naslund both to go into unnecessary detail about things no one else cares about and to repeat herself to the point of self parody somewhere under the barnacle encrustations may be the finely lined hull of a short novel but this was a manuscript desperately in need of editing with a meat axe or a chainsaw the name dropping one of the pleasures of any historical novel is the encounters between fictional characters and historical figures but if badly handled these encounters can un suspend disbelief and downright offend they are badly handled here an almost uneducated hick from the backwoods of kentucky encounters by chance a significant number of the thoughtful elites of mid nineteenth century new england and those she doesn t utterly charm with her brilliance and erudition she gets the better of as in her unintentionally hilarious encounter with naslund s peculiar imagining of nathaniel hawthorne one or two of these developed at greater length could have added to the verisimilitude as it is it is a zelig or a forrest gump without the humor or the self awareness the politics even the most conservative readers would probably find the popular views of a majority of mid nineteenth century new englanders a bit disconcerting if espoused straight in a modern novel so a certain amount of modernizing would be appropriate just to reduce the cringing however naslund takes this to the opposite extreme by having una espouse the politically correct view on every single controversy of the day and some that only exist in our significantly sillier day from slavery to whaling from feminism to free love from homosexuality to sensitivity towards the differently abled all without consequence or even criticism this latter is the most offputting because to have actually championed such views back then would have taken considerable courage whatever one thinks of the ideas themselves una espouses them with all the negative consequences that naslund receives for espousing them today which is to say none the anti christian bigotry there is nothing so very wrong with characters in a mid nineteenth century novel exhibiting agnosticism or atheism as both views were gaining more and more credence at the time but it is downright silly to suggest that such views would have been widely accepted it is even sillier to portray christianity as something confined exclusively to the foolish the bigoted the future apostate or the mentally ill it tells us more about the author than anything else that una is openminded towards every religious and quasi religious idea of the time except christianity the farfetched scenarios i sensed the novel was in trouble during the opening scene in which una loses both her mother and her baby but manages to withstand this blow by making friends with a runaway slave with whom she has a quasi lesbian encounter after this the novel goes into flashback and becomes unrealistic after her crazy christian father threatens to kill her a sentiment the reader will come to know and understand una is raised in a lighthouse by her ludicrously liberal minded aunt and uncle encounters two young men who both fall in love with her disguises herself as a cabin boy and sails on the same whaler with them successfully avoids detection is sunk by a whale survives by committing cannibalism marries the surviving young man after he goes insane and is abandoned by him after he goes to live with the indians leaving her free to marry captain ahab una never really marries anybody but of course nobody ever criticizes things don t get more realistic in the second half which includes una s clever and successful investment in the crazy newfangled idea of obtaining oil from the ground instead of from a whale riiiight the mary sue however the absolute worst thing about this novel is the fact that it is a mary sue that peculiarity of fan fiction in which a laughably idealized and practically perfect in every way alter ego of the author fulfills some basic psychological need while inducing a combination of anger and nausea in the reader a more realistic main character might have saved it una never learns anything from her life s too many to be believed experiences because she already knows everything she doesn t change because she is already perfect she doesn t have to deal with the criticism of others because she doesn t receive any and she doesn t have to beg the forgiveness of those she has wronged because they forgive her so easily and besides una had her reasons and they were very good ones you can be sure the only thing i can figure is that her publisher approved this book on concept alone without anyone ever reading it i feel like i ve just waded through the inept scribbling of a delusional teenage girl who insists on rereading moby dick in her bedroom with the door locked
1,this is something that both my husband and i love to watch we can t wait until season comes to dvd
0,advil liquigels are excellent for headaches i am writing this review to warn customers that this product from amazon does not ship in or weeks as advertised i ordered this product more than months ago and am still waiting for it to be shipped it is probably a good idea to spend the extra few bucks and buy this from the grocery store like i had to eventually do when i ran out

1,i have read this magazine on and off for a several years and wanted to add my cents yes the magazine does have many ads for business opportunities but this is exactly something i want to read and evaluate the marketplace of business opportunities many of these are franchise opportunities which is exactly where the first time entrepreneur should start the articles are generally well written and many will obviously be useful but not all the value of each article often depends on where you are in the business creation process it was not until i read the e myth revisited that i understood the value of these franchises this magazine slices and dices the franchises by many metrics to help you find one where you are most likely to both succeed and be happy the magazine is easily worth more than the price to any person seriously starting or building a small enterprise hope this has been helpful to the entrepreneurs out there

1,bought this one recently for my eight year old and myself to enjoy and it truly took only a few minutes to explain it to him and we were off and loving it more challenging than checkers and less complicated than chess makes it a very accessible game for an eight year old yet not too easy or complex such as can be the case for those two aforementioned games i highly recommend it as it can help your child in a number of ways in terms of concentrating and focusing thinking spatially understanding the consequences of a move or moves and introducing the concept of strategy

0,i myself is a proform treadmill customer and tortured by their customer services i also found some reviews on the internet mentioning their machines broke down in several months after purchase mine in three months the strategy of the customer service is basically make wild guesses of what went wrong and send you the parts asking you to replace it by yourself in one occasion they even asked me to take off the motor and find a local garage to test the motor to see if it s good these back and forth guessing games normally drag on for months and eventually they claim the warranty expired and they can no longer serve you even though it s still within one year i believe you are looking for a treadmill for exercise not to practice your debate skill over the phone with some customer service keep saying this is our policy

0,great book too bad the movie changes almost the entire story by leaps and bounds i was only half way through the novel when i bought the movie almost didn t finish reading it they must have paid the author alot to destroy what could have been an epic film on a brighter note i agree with the other reviewors that saphira s voice was right on and while the movie character of brom was fully wasted jeremy irons did a fine job i look forward to starting the next book but will skip the next movie
0,i absolutely agree with this review you will not get your moneys worth february we bought this stroller per the recommendation of a friend of ours we have the sable color which i see is not sold this year but i digress we have been using this stroller for eight months with our eight month old and are absolutely fed up with it my biggest complaint is the steering the front wheels slide sideways over any smooth surface and if we re not on a smooth surface it feels like i am pushing the stroller into a brick wall because they don t rotate to allow me to push the stroller forwards i am always backing up and turning in order to get the front wheels to align so i can get where i want to go shopping is a joke with this stroller because i cannot get it to navigate the aisles easily the shoulder straps are attached to the back of the stroller with a little plastic tab which really doesn t seem like the best way to keep a child s shoulders restrained it ends up coming out from the tab holder and my son is virtually only wearing a lap belt this is fine now that he is able to handle a point instead of a point harness but when he was younger this got on my nerves the adult cup holder is a joke so we took it off and my son figured out how to take the kid s cupholder out so it doesn t stay in any longer as well oh and the thing folding down so that the handlebar catches the sunshade complaint is spot on so frustrating not a big deal really but poor design because the sunshade prevents the handlebar from locking the folded up stroller in the folded up position most of the time i just remembered also that the sides of the padding in the seat area when i used this stroller with our graco snugride car seat would bunch up and prevent the car seat from sitting securely i would have to prop the edges of the padding in the seat area underneath the arm rests of the seat area the parts that say aria before i put the car seat into the stroller seat area so that it would sit deep enough to latch onto the cup area and allow the security strap to go over the carseat snugly if peg perego could fix the steering i think i would be able to live with the rest of my complaints but the steering factor is enough for me to trash the whole pound thing now that i found another stroller that steers so much easier with my pound month old son
1,i bought this mat because my gym recently began offering yoga classes and the mats they supplied soon got pretty grody this mat is longer and thicker than the gym s version looks a lot nicer and has a good tacky feel under my bare feet and it was cheaper than comparable mats at local stores it s easy to hand wash and comes with instructions so i can keep it clean overall it s a great yoga mat
0,anyone with intelligence can see that ann coulter is not attempting to make any meaningful or objective analysis of politics she is using inflammatory marketing to stir up the emotions of the most die hard flag waving conservatives until this attention seeking labeling of other americans as good or bad stops there will never be true understanding of the complexties of american politics or foreign policy by the general public i don t agree with bush s war and i didnt vote for him but he s not a bad person he did not invade iraq because he is evil or stupid i can appreciate both sides of an argument i can avoid generic categorizations i would never watch any news liberal or conservative that had a clear political bias why can t ann coulter arrive at this same level of common sense well she wouldnt sell as many books she wouldnt be on tv it has to be liberals hate america or the conservative nazi agenda we have the duty as thinking americans in the most advanced free country in the world in these modern times of massive amounts of free information to stop paying attention to this garbage get the facts and stop relying on a figurehead to spoon feed you your opinions

0,this is a cute idea and a cute design but it is not realistic when you put your babydoll inside it takes a bit esp for a child to get the sling hanging around neck correctly and turned right then the poor baby doll falls directly out of it no back support on it the only way she stays in is if your hands never leave her so if the price which is on sale right now lures you i would suggest an older child rather than say or so my year old doesnt like it and for her abilities i dont like it either but now my year old she can do it when she is being patient enough only stars given for its cuteness and price at the moment otherwise too difficult and unsupportive to suit my girls
1,this is one of my favorite candy items and one i think is well purchased by anyone with a sweet tooth any gum lover or any one looking for a taste of the orient three of the flavors in the package peach mixed fruit and green apple are in a brick form they are about in x in and are very soft and easy to chew the remaining four flavors orange strawberry grape and melon all come in small boxes that contain four gumballs each each flavor is powerful without being overpowering they have a smooth almost creamy texture when chewed and blow nice big bubbles also they re not overly sweet or grainy with sugar my teeth are often sensitive if gum is too sugary yet these offer no obstacles only mouth appeal i highly recommend this gum
0,i bought this off amazon years ago and while it is very comfortable it does not stand the test of time within the first year it started to rust and the cording is very stretched out i ve had better luck with a cheaper knockoff i bought at bj s

0,for the price i shouldn t complain but what the heck what ever happened to quality control it came double shrink wrapped there was a plastic handle guard that didn t fit the sword so i had to just throw it away very little pride in the product the wood was roughly sanded before it was painted well it s just a stick afterall i m just glad i did not purchase a more expensive item from this vendor dreamobjects read their feedback responses sounds a lot like aggressive ebay sellers who get their jollies replying to negative or lukewarm feedback sorry waste of my time and a few dollars i gave them a out of feedback simply because you can t tell quality from a single digital photo
1,this is a great linguisa i usually buy mine from a store a few towns away because they have hot chorizo sausage but these have a really great flavor even though they are not hot and they are organic the fat content is minimal when microwaving for a fast high protein snack yet it s high enough to use only the meat to coat the pan when adding it to scrambled eggs and the price is good too free shipping and handling with a nominal purchase makes this a really good buy i highly recommend it

0,i was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much i thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything but when i tried it i discovered things first off your legs have to be at a degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one and when i finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it s on it only burns about a calorie a minute this bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn t move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance though i only tried it for a few minutes but definitely not for your legs

0,i did not buy this from amazon but sought it out here so i could vent about this outrageous product that s outrageous in its traditional meaning that it outrages me this is two packets of colored dust approximately the consistency of unmixed plaster empty the plastic bags and the colored dust flies everywhere mold it in your hand and it retains its shape for a few seconds before blurring and falling apart my wife and i repeatedly checked the packaging to see if we should add water or do something else to make this usable but apparently not the claim on the package is that it molds like dough obviously intended to remind us of play doh but play doh is a clay like material that retains its shape and can in fact be molded this material again attempting to compare itself to play doh states that it won t dry out of course not it s dust it can t dry out there s nothing drier than dust in case you re wondering i have no connection to play doh or its makers i don t even know who does make it i m simply the father of a year old who uses play doh often and hoped this product might be a workable addition to our playtime wrong
0,i ordered the gift set and it came as advertised very cute package unfortunately no one sells this product on the east coast that i could find so i could not test it it is far too strong a scent even the lotion the candle filled the house with the scent in minutes my advice find someone or someplace that offers this product before purchasing

1,i love the bag for all the reasons others did not like it the product is listed as a gadget bag and that is what it is good at the is is a large camera for a point and shoot and it fits in very few bags this bag fit the camera easily and had space for all types of extras including batteries chargers and extra media cards there is also enough room for another small digital camera or a film point and shoot the correct way to advertise this case would have been for up to two bodies or four small lens given that limitation this is a great bag the bag is very well made and holds my canon powershot is very securely i lay the camera on it s back and that means that even if i accidently power it on the lens opens harmlessly the material is great and the waist belt is very practical the strap is well padded and after a day of use i believe it is one of the most comfortable straps i have used buy this bag for the correct camera and you will be very happy with it

0,what a huge disappointment this release is i was suspecting that it wouldn t be all that great when i saw that the studio that originally produced this show century fox was the same video company releasing it well the first season looks horrible the source material is all dupe prints some parts of which are out of focus scratched and dirty in all cases the image is soft and well like compared to what fox is releasing of voyage to the bottom of the sea produced the same year and at the same studio as boone this release is nothing short of a disgrace we should be given pristine source material and we re not i suspect fox wouldn t release the original camera negs from it s vaults without a substantial fee anyway season one of daniel boone isn t worth buying i haven t seen season two when the show started filming in color but i m now afraid to look
1,i got this for my month son he really loves it he doesn t use it as a ride on yet more fun will await but he pushes the car from the back handle everywhere inside out there are alot of buttons which make sounds and some have the car talk back the oil change sounds are his fav he also enjoys the toy phone when you put it in the slot it rings and the car answers there is also a small storage section under the seat the only thing i wish it did have was a horn sound instead of one of the many car s sayings for the price it is a great interactive toy and for a boy who usually is not big on his toys for very long this still captures his attention months afterward oh and this toy can take a beating no complaints whatsoever a great find
1,my daughter received this toy for christmas and at seven weeks old immediately loved it my five month old nephew also received one and loves it as well it is easy for infants to grab and soft so they don t hurt themselves when they pull it towards their face and mouth the colors are visually engaging and it has a nice rattle sound to it loud enough to get the child s attention not too loud to be an annoying toy i recommend this toy for anyone shopping for a shower or birthday gift
0,while i realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book it reminds me of the story the emperor has no clothes yes choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying the flipping back and forth was not accomplished in a smooth flowing manner in addition the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved the kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived it would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone

0,i upgraded to this phone recently from a treo that had speaker and audio problems don t all treo s suffer from that within a year s usage and was already replaced once with a refurbished one that developed same problems i loved my treo anyway so i expected something equivalent to the but what i got was a smartphone with quite a stupid battery life i have decided that there is definitely some glitch in design some online geeks suggest it might actually be the sim card that is causing power to run right out of the phone in a sharp decline even when its not in use and all possible extraneous functions are disabled add to this the fact that palm s website s online user group is not active right now so no users can visibly discuss this among themselves and you don t have to think too long to conclude that palm knew this either beforehand or pretty quickly afterward when they recently dumped this cheaper smartphone on the market recently palm all i can say is pretty stupid and wonder if this was your last hurrah before exiting the smartphone market

1,this review is about the oral b flexisoft replacement heads coupled with the braun electric toothbrushes this is one of the most effective aids to oral hygiene ever developed my introduction to oral b goes back over years to a usaf basic training briefing a dental technician held up an oral b toothbrush with medium bristles and said this is the toothbrush you need if you want to keep your teeth or some such statement like that well i haven t lost one yet the motorized mechanicals of the toothbrush do most of the work while you guide the oscillating round head around and over your pearly whites while the heads are undeniably pricey when looked at just in dollars and cents there is value in the fact that the total package actually makes a rather mundane chore a little more fun while actually living up to the claim that it does a better job on your teeth than manual brushing since i ve always believed the entire surface area of the toothbrush head was meant to be covered with toothpaste and the size of the head on these is smaller than the average brush i know i m using less toothpaste to do the same job while this is no big deal the long term economic benefit is plaque under control healthy gums and a bright smile full of natural teeth it s kind of hard to deny it works since my dentist has confirmed the positive results upon direct examination just be careful what model of these brush heads you are selecting and watch the pricing oral b uses a kind of color code for the bristles and the ones that have the colored indicator bristles in a line with the shaft are the flexisoft model that seems to equate to medium hardness enjoy life

0,i m sure that this review isn t unique spin rotates the same ten bands on its cover not to mention the ridiculous articles written within by the time they get done describing the euro punk indie pop artist that just slammed them in the face on their way to the train station with their jazzed up sound i ve completely forgotten the point of thier article they must have the greatest time just sitting around finding how many contradictory adjectives they can tag onto useless music and still manage to say nothing they sound like cyber nerds who need to get out a little more and stop getting thier info from mtv com i m sure that i ve learned more about what thier editors do in the office on any given day than anything remotely close to music while reading spin next time you see it on the stands i suggest you spin in another direction

0,colorado s san juan mountains from durango to silverton to ouray is my favorite place to vacation in the usa so when i saw the preview of durango kids on another dvd i decided to rent it on netflix it is one of those movies where villains are cartoonish and the kids while cute outsmart all the stupid adults the first minutes showed some nice locations in and around durango including the steam train that s why i purchased a used copy but then it goes into time travel to save ouray from becoming a ghost town and the movie becomes a stupid bore intended for young and undemanding children don t bother unless you love durango as much as i do

0,i purchased this item two weeks ago my thought was that it seemed like a reasonably priced perfect addition to the tools necessary for a budding amateur backyard astronomy hobby its advertised contents construction and glow in the dark planisphere after closely examining the item for the past ten days i m forced to conclude that i was in error and that you really do get what you pay for as celestron is one of the most reputable names in astronomy i must confess that i assumed that quality would follow in all products that bear their name i have found that this does not hold true in the case of these sky maps the major problem with the package is that it is rife with misspellings letter transpositions apparent omitted words and just plain what we used to call in the old days typographical errors additionally when i compare some of the technical information on the maps i e star magnitudes astronomical distances etc and accompanying descriptions with other authoritative astronomy sources i have in my possession i also find numerous apparent errors and discrepances when using a product like this it is essential that one be able to trust the data and information it contains since i m not able to do this i must rate this item with one star when i purchased the item it was marked down by twenty percent i note that in less that two weeks since my purchase the price has been further reduced by another thirteen percent in this case don t be fooled as i was by an attractive price avoid this product i don t have a substitute to recommend at this time
0,i was so excited to get this the terrain on our lot has quite a slant to it because we re on a hill my husband and i thought this would easily help us create a materials list for our retaining walls that we wanted to put out front long story short i spent hours at least getting the dimensions of our house correct and trying to get the yard right we even rented a surveying instrument to determine the slope of our yard to input elevation points many hours wasted the software does not let you set the height of the retaining walls and it inputs random walls and pieces of wall in the d view that you can t get rid of the flowers are hard to place they don t end up where you want them besides the plant chooser doesn t have hardly any perrenial plants to choose from bottom line i spent in software costs and for a surveying instrument and ended up having to calculate the wall length and height manually if you have a flat lot this might work well for you for anyone that has hills or slopes to their yard good luck

0,what is it with these gossip magazines please tell me because i truly think no one in their right mind would ever subscribe to this garbage all it is is mindless crap that the media puts into kids minds while not having anything important else in the magazine unless your years old do not subscribe to this there are better magazines out there fortunately like seventeen and cosmogirl which aren t nearly as filled with garbage like this the reason you don t see j or this magazine or any other magazine like this on the top of the magazine list is because it has no effect on people it s for little kids and it s not mature period
1,i enjoyed playing this game when it would let me the amount of bugs in this game is downright outrageous crashes left and right it was a good story though i suppose i could give you a few tips to stop the dantooine framerate from dropping go to the folder where your game files are ex c program files lucasarts and open the ini file on my xp the icon was a notepad with a cogwheel over it and under the graphics options heading insert a line and type disable vertex buffer objects that should get rid of any bad framerate drops on dantooine and at least make it playable also i had a glitch near the end of the game where i went back to dantooine but when i tried to get off my ship the planet wouldn t load i tried restarting and all that jazz nothing worked finnaly i found online a cheatcode to warp straight to dantooine so to use it open the ini file as i said above and under the game options header insert a line and type enablecheats then start starwars and load your game and press this button the one with the sign right above it just above the tab key then type warp then press enter don t worry about the fact you can t see your typing the cheat console is invisible and tada your on dantooine and can finish your game the only other advice i have for you is save often and don t overwrite your saved games i found that saving your games as etc to be a quick way to do this may the force be with you
0,purchased this phone as an upgrade from the which i loved i was at the end of a year contract and felt that i would get something with a few more bells and whistles and was excited about the color screen with the icons two of my family members have higher end nextels and all work well i would have purchased one of those except i didn t really care about a camera for my phone and this one was reasonably priced and i found out you get what you pay for the felt almost cheap in construction compared to the and even my old i had it for a couple of weeks when i started having trouble with the clarity of my calls i could hear them but they couldn t hear me a couple of times i had the screen go to airplane mode even when i hadn t touched it the fact that you had to take the whole phone out to see who is calling was another downside too my previous phone had to be flipped open to see who was calling but i had a holster that could hold the phone without disengaging it not a great design for this holster another problem is with the power supply when charging the phone it is especially important to make sure the plug is seated tight and to check that is says device attached it comes out easy and stops charging even when it appears to be plugged into the phone correctly then i am on a phone call on speakerphone and the whole speaker just stops working living in california apparently gives us an advantage day risk free guarantee fortunately we were on day and after minutes one accidental disconnection by nextel and customer service agents i finally received a return authorization and placed a new order terrible terrible phone stay away from it hoping the new one on it s way works much better michell
0,i m rather upset with the technical quality of this dvd grindhouse rereleased this disc exactly as it was in without so much as a animorphic upgrade this is certainly not worth the dollar price tag amazon com has right now
1,this is one of my all time favorite films fosse only made feature films in his career sweet charity cabaret lenny this one and star but everyone is a masterpiece this is his best film it s an autobiographical film about a filmmaker choreographer who s addicted to work booze pills sex work booze more pills etc etc it s definitely based of fosse himself and it s a rather painful portrait fosse should be commended for admitting for lack of a better term that s he s not a great person there s no closure scenes here where joe gideon wonderfully played by roy scheider fosse s alter ego realises the error of his ways and makes peace with everyone fosse shows warts and more warts but in spite of that the film is amazing brilliantly edited shot acted and choreographed this is fosse s best film one that really defined him as an artist fosse was not a prolific filmmaker but when he did make a film it was a masterpiece and this is his greatest one
1,good product probably the best digital frame in the market drawbacks are the user interface and the difficulty to set up the wireless connection
1,the next gen console wars are now officially in full swing with the release of the and wii so that leaves everyone with the decision of choosing the right system i ll start with saying that the wii fits a different demographic than the and perhaps a gamer looking for something different or perhaps a system for a family with young ones also if you want to try to get your girlfriend to play games with you this system would be the one to do it to me it makes a good second console but for the hardcore gamer this is not going to satisfy as a core gaming machine the real battle for the traditional hardcore gamer market is between the and the i own a and have followed the closely until release and have played it the two systems are very close in power regardless of what sony s marketing hype and brainwashing tactics might lead you to believe the cell processor cannot slice bread and let s just leave it at that currently the better library belongs to the it has more aaa titles than the and it will remain that way throughout the xbox simply has a better lineup gears of war is one of the best games you will ever play it is incredible in every way and features new gameplay mechanics that make it more than just another cookie cutter shooter like resistance i would call resistance a very good game but gears is a truly great game lost planet exclusive to xbox will follow this up in early with more person shooting action if you have not seen this game prepare to be amazed rpgs are covered with oblivion the upcoming galactic epic mass effect and the eerie underwater adventure rpg bioshock alan wake is another hit in the making along with too human from talented developer silicon knights that is a lot of brand new ips for the sony no longer has a hold on grand theft auto and we will see in debut on the at the same time as add to that better versions of the tom clancy games since the primary development platform is the for those franchises racing got the sequel to the acclaimed forza motorsport finally what better way to end than with halo if you simply must have the new metal gear and devil may cry the is for you i am tired of those games not to mention final fantasy xixxixv the offers what i see as the best gaming experience refreshing new titles sequels to legacy xbox titles amazing graphical power and the most comfortable controller on the market not only that it s cheaper to boot
1,i am a huge fan of world war first person shooters i ve been with the genre since the begining of medal of honor since then not too much has been more impresive to me than call of duty it was a wonderfual game and still is call of duty was even better does this new game maintain the stellar streak the series is on in a word yes although it is alot more of the same but then again why mess with a great formula call of duty works because it is exactly what the original game was built around sheer intensity and also alot of fun but then you might say well i ve played are you saying its the same yes and no the basic mechanics are the same and the few newly added gameplay elements do little to nothing for the overall game so in escense yea its the same game but this time around the levels are bigger and look o so much prettier honestly these are some of the most amazing visuals on the xbox i dare say it puts my beloved to near shame the lighting and texturing is beautiful and the explosions are heart stopping to behold the life like graphics are complimented by a brilliant musical score oh and if anyone should wonder about the ingame soundeffects just pop in a previous call of duty game and imagine it amped up even more seriously the battlechatter has never been so nicely integrated is yet another amazing world war game that will certainly keep veterans of the genre happy and content meaning on the edge of your seat the newly implimented rag doll physics and destructable enviroments will make sure you stay there too i reccomend this game to anyone and everyone who has played a world war two first person shooter and enjoyed it because what we have here ladies and gentelmen is the latest and greatest the best that money can buy
1,i am sure this is a good stroller that s why i bought it my review is more of a word of caution this thing takes forever to arrive don t be fooled usually ships within hours really means may ship sometime as of our stroller has not arrived it was ordered january it is not even slated to ship for another week we ll see meanwhile the local store has several in stock my advice for anyone trying to time this as a gift or for a trip or other occasion go to your local store otherwise be prepared to wait a very long time
1,below is my recent review of the jvc everio gz which has a hard drive rather than becase gz seems to be identical to gz save the hard drive capacity i thought this review would be useful to those considering to buy gz i have been using this camcorder for almost two weeks now and here are my impressions pros a this is a tiny camcorder and i can easily carry it in my pocket everyday b it records directly on a harddrive this is probably the most amazing feature of this camera it has the following amazing benefits a huge recording space random access to recorded videos when browsing through a thumblist of videos super fast transfer onto your computer through usb no tapes no cds no dvds to worry about while recording video facilitates easy archiving organizing for example all the recorded files on the camera s harddrive have creation date s as a part of their file information when the camera is connected to your computer you can sort all files by date and easily separate all recordings by date to different folders by simply selecting and dragging this is extra but if you want to index and be able to search your video files say with google desktop simply enter a list of keywords in the file name about the contents of the file the harddrive on your camera can double as additional portable storage media this is unlikely but if you wanted you could even install linux on it and carry with you an operating system on your camera c video quality is good for a consumer level video camera the sound quality recorded through the internal microphone is good i can hear the lectures i record very clearly and there is no annoying noise generated by the camera d the charger that comes with this camera is very small so you can carry that around as well and worry less about running out of battery cons a no mic jacks b manual focus and light adjustments are done through menus c the editing software that comes with it is limited d the battery life is a mere hour but you can buy a hour battery for dollars as with all camcorders the still images shot with this camera are not at the level of quality you can get from a good still camera it produces reasonable snapshots in well lit situations the video files recorded by this camera have a mod extension in their name i replace mod with mpg and most of my standard video viewing software automatically recognize the files
1,this is a great camera that takes the place of an earlier canon digital elph that i lost several years ago the megapixels ensures great quality and the zoom provides crisp clear pictures in fact the digital zoom also works great just make sure the camera is steady i purchased a nice compact monopod and the results were awesome although the image stabilization feature on the newer models would have been great to have you can t beat the price and overall quality of this camera and the pictures it takes the canon is a great little camera
1,if a book makes me look forward to mid life i am all over it this book was actually required reading for my course study in human development what a find here harvard researcher and bestselling author joan borysenko takes the cycles of a woman s life and divides them into year increments along the journey she also makes a great case for debunking old myths about women and aging that s a big ms borysenko i find myself constantly at odds with the beauty images that the media gives us i mean come on why o why are we more often rewarding people for how they look and less for what they contribute to society perhaps it s escapism i tell myself in effort to sleep at night yet after reading borsyenko s book i m reminded that yes it s good to follow intellectual pursuits and yes there s differences between women and men according to borysenko women are most often motivated by what they can contribute to society family and how to make a difference in the world men tend to define themselves by their work most telling anyhow i won t give away the store here but in my opinion if you are of the female persuasion you will not want to miss this read
1,i ve tried a lot of different nutrition and energy bars and these are my favorites along with a couple of other chocolate zoneperfect bars like double chocolate and chocolate raspberry great taste a nice texture sort of like nestle crunch and much more satisfying than candy bars almost as tasty as girl scout thin mints but not as fat and guilt inducing
1,this is a nice harmonica in a convenient hard case it s a good size like the old marine band it plays easily and has a good tone only problem is a couple of notes keep sticking and won t play i wedged them open but they stuck again oh well it s still nice

0,cheap and definitely nasty they may look nice and robust given the hardened plastic ear cups but after a few months light use i lost sound through one cup then the other in general when placed over the ears you do get an echo effect of surrounding noise unless you actually have the noise cancelling unit turned on the batteries seemed to last pretty long though actually the battery i had in there lasted longer than the unit itself very disappointing but for the price this is hardly unexpected
1,qbq by john miller is simply amazing this little book is a grand slam all the way qbq strips away all the excuses and reminds us again where it is the buck is supposed to stop if you re looking for an instruction manaual for leaders here it is people don t need tricks methods myths or secrets what they really need is a tool that helps them step up to the plate and be accountable for their own results one of the biggest weaknesses of the american workforce is the ability to accept responsibility and accountability for our own actions bravo for qbq
0,i bought this album after hearing about them from a fellow beach boys fan i m a huge pet sounds fan but i love all kinds of orchestrated rock from the left banke to beulah this album is not that good people it s not even okay there are way better takes on the brian wilson read phil spector sound whether it s the ladybug transistor or the apples in stereo heck check out a great vancouver band called ashley park as well the production on this is so rooted in the eighties nineties that it s almost unlistenable they may be good road musicians but it doesn t show on this album especially since some of tracks use lamo drum loops a la stone roses you would be better off going through the elephant label s recordings or even merge stuff to be honest i didn t even find the compositions that scintillating regardless of the production chord and change wise they re interesting but that doesn t make the songs good
0,easily the worst textbook i encountered during my undergraduate years unfocused sparse and almost completely lacking example problems riggs touches briefly on lots of topics and treats none of them completely leaving the reader lacking any notion of how process control actually works in real life i m not a big fan of the book by seborg et al either but if you have to choose between the two go with seborg
1,i love this formula for my thick naturally curly slightly hilighted hair it does a great job cleaning without stripping and this is the first conditioner that did a good job tackling my naturally curly hair without weighing it down i did get a good deal at my salon for the shampoo and a little more for the conditioner
1,i ve bought two of these atomic clocks the first a wood framed model soon stopped keeping accurate time and started acting unpredictably the second this model has been on my wall for a week and is keeping good time after an easy setup insert battery push est button i am nicking it a star because it makes a noticeable tick sound in a quiet room making it inappropriate for a bedroom
1,i can t believe how well made this set is i have been looking for good quality kitchen toys for my daughter for christmas i wanted something sturdy and not plastic i just received my order today and these items are great my son opened the box and tested them for his little sister and he can t wait to play with them with her i ordered this set and the baking set and both are made out of solid wood and are extremely durable i am very impressed and wish amazon carried the matching coffee pot and blender i also had a problem with the velcro on the butter it was an easy fix with some super glue i think the heat during the shipping made the velcro come off
1,it is extremely easy to use hard to figure out the menu but once that is done there is no problem takes beautiful pictures great for action shots as well seldom find a blurry photo as it has a stabelizer built in
0,decent camera but not great shark mode is nice housing looks good but mine leaked at ft camera was dead by the time i got it out of the water good news is that amazon processed the defective product return rapidly and credited my account in about a week net result was one decent picture and a disappointing christmas present next time i will buy a housing for a better camera canon has some nice ones
0,in the past i used to distance myself from certain rock genres because of a bad first experience i d be introduced to band not like it and claim the entire genre as being not for me the forecast however has changed how i feel i personally love a heartfelt emo record just as much as the next guy but only because i was introduced to jimmy eat world and spitalfield a couple of years back those bands allowed me to embrace the entire genre as a whole and expand my emo knowledge imagine though if you will that i was new to emo you in theory hand me a copy of late night conversations and tell me to listen of course i hate it and lose any interest i may have had in the genre to make a long story short the only good that came out of late night conversations an underproduced generic stale piece of s t was the revelation that came post listen never judge an entire genre by the first or second band you re introduced to from said entire genre not every metal band is iron maden not every punk pop band is blink not every nu metal band is linkin park not every emo band is jimmy eat world every aspect of music has it s ups and downs and the forecast is clearly one of the downs now that i ve bored you with an entire rant about nothing i d like you to pass on late night conversations with your help the forecast won t sell another record and in turn leave the scene forever not recommended duh

0,i bought this as a travel charger for my blackberry all i can say is awful awful awful i followed instructions in the manual which are pretty easy and charged up the solio after waiting twice as long as required i tried to plug it into my blackberry to see how it charged big mistake not only did it not charge a weird red battery icon came on in the upper left of the screen and then the blackberry promptly crashed i tried this routine several times over several days with the same result rereading the manual so many times it was ridiculous finally i had enough and told the customer service for solio that i was returning it not only did they never return my money i had to call my cc company to handle it no one ever said what the problem could be my advice stay away from this thing it may seen cool or environmentally friendly but it is junk a piece of over priced junk

0,i got this because it was cheap but since it doesn t work and i have to get another i didn t really save any money the lever on top that looks like the lever on other hand pumps actually does nothing it s completely fake nothing inside moves when you move it and it certainly does not help grab on to the valve it s just something you can play with while you re waiting for someone with a decent pump to come help you i did just manage to get air into a fully inflated tire with a flat tire i couldn t keep a solid enough contact with the valve to get air in
1,this album is a great representation of what spoon is about great music along with fantasticly written lyrics provide a feeling of sheer uphoria to one s ears spoons sound is somewhat like cake but different in ways as well they are a very good band that should be getting more cred than what they are getting some of my faves on this cd include mathematical mind the two sides of monsieur valentine sister jack and i turn my camera on i would strongly recommend this cd to anyone that like alternative rock definately money well spent

1,this lounge deck chair cushon is worth every peny it is thick comfortable none of those deck chairs are comfortable without a substantial cushion available in several color choices and has a soft not plasticky cover fabric you will have to measure the width of your deck chair carefully to see if it will fit it just barely fit my titanic deck chair because i had to scrunch it up a bit near the arms but all turned out well and i must say i am very happy with it it is a quality product and will keep you much more comfortable during your hours on the patio than those cheaper but much thinner types sold at outlet stores or supermarkets in summer get the best this is it

0,i purchased this mouse months ago and it has been total frustration ever since the buttons on the sides are not easy to access or use but most frustrating is the way the two main buttons perform when i clicked on them they end up double clicking which caused a lot of problems with retrieving my email messages i know some may be thinking i haven t configured the settings correctly but i went over it several times and couldn t get it to work right what s even more frustrating is the support at razer is non existent they never responded to my email questions which i submitted several times before giving up i ended up buying a wacom intuos tablet which works amazingly well and gives me so much more i am a commercial illustrator so it is the perfect mouse pen tool for my needs don t buy this product i would have given it a negative stars if that were an option at it s a steep price to pay for the frustration and a complete waste of time and money
1,my husband is an in between size in waist and these new jeans allow that little extra umph that he needs to be able to be comfortable in his clothing we love them i gave him two pair for christmas and he had me to order two more pair recently seems he has decided to throw out the old ones and replace with these they look great too
1,but the movie was pretty good i found myself highly disappointed in the book and almost wasn t able to finish it the characters were flat the story reading like a history lesson in religion through the ages and not a true story so i wasn t sure what to make of the movie i was pleasantly surprised though to enjoy the movie immensely it was long but it kept the pace going throughout the subtitling in the latin and french was a bit mundane to drudge through but it made the movie a bit more believable than everyone speaking english when the main character is actually french teabing was played brilliantly and while hanks was not who i would have thought for langdon he did a superb job in the role if you can set your personal beliefs aside and view the movie as a piece of exceptional fiction drama and suspense it is well worth watching murder mystery suspense action drama it s all there in this film
1,certainly there are more expensive teas but i ve yet to have a better cup than twinings earl grey which is a perfect blend of comfort and spice it works brilliantly as a good morning how do you do or a rest well sweet dreams sort of a beverage many other earl greys on the market struggle with the proper blending of the bergamot oil which can be quite overwhelming if overdone but it is what makes earl grey unique so one does want to be able to taste it too many other tea companies cannot seem to grasp this delicate balance but twinings has always gotten it just right the tea can be enjoyed au naturel or with a slight dash of cream not too much because you don t want to drown out the enjoyable lively flavor of the bergamot for me when it comes to a cup of hot tea this is simply the best
1,after reading numerous raving reviews here at amazon com and at several other sites and learning that auto clay was safe for clear coat paints because it works through a non abrasive process i decided to give it a try and boy was i glad i did my car was covered with a stubborn deposit of dirt and grime that simply would not come off with a car wash it seemed that the dirt and grime had gotten lodged in the paint and wouldn t budge no matter how hard i tried washing the car after every car wash i would run my fingers through the paint and it would still feel gritty that was when i learned about mothers california gold clay bar paint saving system kit the results were astounding after using it the paint no longer felt gritty but glassy smooth the paint was no longer dulled by contaminants and the car looked like it has a new coat of paint i was immensely pleased with the results unlike a lot of car polish or polishing compounds that use abrasion to strip away surface contaminants auto clay simply picks up surface contaminants and locks them into the clay the clay looks and feels exactly like plasticine play and it is used along with the included lubricant spray actually an auto soap that provide lots of suds like meguiar s gold class will work equally well mind you car polish still has its place in paint restoration because claying will not remove scratches only a car polish or a polishing compound harsher can do that and remember always follow the claying with an application of wax to shield your paint from new contaminants also clay your car every so often and you will keep the paint looking like new i am giving mothers california gold clay bar paint saving system kit my highest recommendation go on try it and see for yourself firsthand the difference it makes in your car paint it s worth every penny and i m sure you ll be glad you did
0,i recently bought items from this brand lumiscope actually this is the only item that works among them though i am kind of suspicious about it s inconsistent readings from time to time i think braun is a much better product which i bought one for my parents in china during sars epidemic it never failed and provided consistent readings

0,upon the joyful news that we were having a girl my husband decided to invest in a new digital camera and a photo printer the digital camera still works great the printer is another matter while this one prints beautiful pictures the cost of ink far outweighs the beauty of them sometimes as we all know this is how printer companies make their money through the ink replacing every cartridge at once will run you about at a time give or take a few the gray ink is used up the quickest and has also been one of the hardest for us to find here locally the main problem i have with this printer is that the quality is excellent after you replace the ink but for only about the first pictures after that the pictures take on too much of a magenta cast and start to get out of register very frustrating when you re printing out any pictures let alone ones of your child yes we do what the manual sugests for such occasions and the main one is to clean the printer cartridge heads but this has only actually worked for us on one occassion every other time get us no results and we are still stuck with pictures that resemble something a third grader took a crayon to in the long run i will not be buying a photo printer for home use but will rather take them to a store for processing quality wise it gets you in the beginning but doesn t hold out for the long run we have fiddled with it for two years enough s enough

0,following on from the fantastic the duel allison moorer s latest release getting somewhere is a massive massive disappointment quite simply the material on getting somewhere is weak and gutless on the rare occasions moorer tries to emulate the beauty and feel of the duel such as on hallelujah new years day earle rips the heart out of the material with such an amateurish pedestrian and thin production that you feel cheated business and pleasure rarely mix and moorer should take a long hard look at this release and give serious consideration to re installing rs field next time around if moorer wants a guitar groove that burns drums that drive and vocals that mesmerise then earle is simply not the man for the job moorer is a fantastic talent who has one of the finest female voices of any genre she can write a mean song too this cd showcases none of her abilities and should be consigned to the bargain bins immediately
0,i live in a apt in nyc so roaches are very common problem after a long battle i finally got rid of the roaches in my place but i cannot escape the bugs visiting from other apartments i thought this device could help with that problem also i don t like to use the spray too often or have all the baits gels and other poisons around so i decided to try these things unfortunately they don t work the first week i bought them i saw a big roach crawl under the door and walk directly under the repeller straight to the dining room the ultrasonic frequency did nothing to it instead of this repeller i use limonel orange peel oil is a safe alternative to use when children are present and it does repell and kill the bugs so how to get rid of roaches seal every crack nook and cranny with expansive foam wood sealer etc mine came in through the bathroom and kitchen vents so i put mosquito screens to block their way in also i sealed the gaps between the wall and the electrical outlets in the apt with silicone and i bought a plastic stripe that closes the gap between the door and the floor also my husband sprays once every months with repellent good luck
0,i bought this for my daughter the display was dead when it arrived i took it a local jewelry counter for a new battery and the live battery let some display show but it was a garbled display and not able to be set or used my daughter found a much cheaper watch at target with more features a stopwatch this one wasn t even worth sending back
1,i love lola lip gloss it isn t too tacky lasts a long time and the colors are gorgeous i bought the fantastica color as a key chain lip gloss several years ago and was so impressed with it that i bought la petite menagerie as a replacement i love the idea of having it on a key chain so your never without lip gloss all the colors in this kit are great
1,the reviewer below must have some other conflict with the game because i am currently running a game of with windows xp as i make this post
1,prior to you could use the mil multifunction indicator light codes on your dash this tool accomplishes the same thing plus a lot more in these days of computerized cars it s a necessity if you wish to fix your own vehicle don t expect this tool to tell you exactly what went bad and what part to replace you need to have a working knowledge of automotive mechanics and a service manual of the vehicle is a great help almost a must this tool will steer you in the right direction example my car s transmission quit dead in the road without any prior warning do i take it to a dealer and spend much or so for a rebuild not yet my scanner said gears had the wrong gear ratio huh wot well after examining my service manual i determined that a sensor that measures input and output speeds must be bad i bought the sensor for and fixed it by the way i m not an auto mechanic i m a diemaker

1,i bought my on ebay and it was sold unlocked unbranded and it was of the quad band variety here s my take pros durability this thing was built with the clumsy in mind like me i must have dropped this thing a dozen times and there s barely a scratch player i agree that the onboard of memory is a joke but with the cost of transhflash memory coming down i bought my chip on ebay for then upgrading is easy and affordable that being said the player is a feature you will actually use and the sound quality is good i ve had no problem with playing my itunes music as long as they re format and no greater that in quality then it will play fine media player defaults to wma and itunes defaults to formats you need to convert them to or change the default in either program to rip to format you can change the default to in the settings menu programmable smart keys i read where one user complained that the camera button was not on the side it was the camera icon button on the front keypad he must not have known that you can reprogram all of the smart buttons from the personalize menu not only that but you can rearrange the menu buttons and program most of the buttons on the face for frequently used apps it s a handy little feature built in bluetooth and edge technology you may not use these features out of the box but they re for the time when these technologies are more commonplace i use my bluetooth for my wireless headset and for syncing and adding files s pics etc to my phone with my laptop quad band world phone capable this phone works on and gsm networks although that has not been personally tested however i will be traveling to micronesia and the uk within the year and i ll know for certain by then cons there s a slight delay when you answer a call i usually have to say hello times or wait a few seconds before i begin to speak i don t know if this is a carrier problem or the phone i use cingular prepaid the light stays on while charging even when the phone is powered off it s annoying the onboard memory is a joke you really need to upgrade the memory if you want to do anything extra with the phone it has a monochrome outer display full color inside this doesn t bother me at all but it s not as flashy as razr or other phones overall this is a great durable little phone with handy features i think people will actually use i ve read where people complain about the picture quality but that s what a digital camera is for if you want a good quality cell phone that s well designed user friendly and doesn t look like a tricked out teenager s phone then this is the phone for you
0,these were good burgers but i did not find anything special about them i could go to the supermarket near my house and get some ground beef and make my own for a lot less money and they would taste just as good these are good but not worth the extra money
0,this water jet has a button on the handle just like the waterpic you push it to temporarily stop the flow of water here s a warning it can take a lot of finger pressure to stop the flow of water especially if you have adjusted the dial for a hard flow if you lack ordinary strength in your fingers stay away from this machine i don t have a finger strength problem yet several times i ve squirted water all over the bathroom because somehow i hadn t pushed hard enough on the stop button i had purchased a waterpik but had trouble with it leaking and so purchased this conair the waterpik is a much better quality product the conair seems to be very cheaply made and i am not very happy with it i am going back to using my waterpik even though it occasionally springs a leak

1,when one begins to despair about the quality or lack thereof of the modern novel you come across a gem which dispels that despair for the time being not only is this one a gem but also it is something much more and being just over pages one that i finished all too quickly i could not get enough of it the narrator and main character of the novel is a mr stevens who is the butler of a mansion where he heads a considerable compliment of staff to keep it running smoothly his employer a lord darlington is doing what he can to alleviate some of the supposed harsher terms of the versailles treaty and realizes too late that he was being used as a pawn by the germans and what did mr stevens think of this he didn t he maintains that wondering about what was happening would have interfered with his running of the estate there is also the head housekeeper that he buts heads with a few times and also a few other instances which makes one wonder if she has something other that a professional interest in mr stevens you ll have to read the book if you want to know more i read mainly victorian literature simply because they are well written and what passes for a novel nowadays usually is not if you get this book you will not be sorry
0,this has all of the features of the headset that came with my phone and it was much less expensive than buying a replacement headset from t mobile brand new and i had to jiggle the cable near the plug to get it to work in order to fit anyone but a newborn i had to pull the earpieces apart which could have broken the wires if i weren t careful and may tear further through wearing it the mike is located symmetrically from both earpieces this means that the mike is lodged at my addams apple there are several places which i m worried will break soon through normal wear and tear the ear pieces are hard plastic and look like they ll be uncomfortable if worn for a long time the reason i needed stereo headsets in the first place was to listen to music also be warned that shipping was listed as for a item when it was sent in an envelope that only needed stamps the cable is barely feet long from mike to plug so i don t recommend it for tall people it will do until i can find better but that s the best i can sa

1,i searched for a simple sturdy reasonably priced and highly effective book stand for weeks i ve looked at pricey wood stands to poorly designed plastic stands with metal attachments i bought the bookbuddy based on the student reviews and i have not been disappointed i am a graduate student and a business consultant i tote the bookbuddy to school work and my home office without missing a beat i love the ease and portability you could pay more and get a lot less buy a bookbuddy and you won t need to do either
1,we love the diaper dekor and have referred it to many of our friends and family it is super simple to use and the refills which seem expensive at first are actually cheaper than other brands because they last for months vs a week i e diaper genie from reading the other reviews i think i can clear a few things up it seems these people have been misled hence their problems with this product first there are versions of this pail a larger called diaper dekor plus and regular size called simply diaper dekor thus there are different sizes of refills plus and regular you can find out which model you have by simply opening the door on the pail there is a sticker that will have the model on there if you do not see plus anywhere you will need to buy regular refills the plus will not fit and vice versa secondly the refills are very easy to insert you simply follow the directions which come with the unit basically you remove the plastic insert wrap the opened refills from the inside of the insert and around the top the excess refill wraps around the outside of the plastic and then you sit it in the pail knot tied in the bottom of the new refill if you have a unit this will make sense if you haven t bought one yet i probably just confused you but you will see once you get it that it is very easy to do last but not least the refills that have been on the market for the past year have absolutely no scent at all i personally would not mind having a baby powder scent but these have no scent it s not like i will be sniffing inside the pail or anything so it doesn t matter afterall once the refill is in the pail no scent will come out not even dirty diapers unfortunately it seems these few reviewers who gave this product a poor rating were misinformed by store workers and their poor review actually had nothing to do with the product but rather frustration stemming from unknowledgable employees at baby stores i hope this has helped we ve had this unit for nearly a year and absolutely swear by it it is a godsend no smells and how much easier can you get than just dropping a diaper into the pail and not having to do another thing not many other units will allow you to store up to weeks of diapers without a single scent
0,this is not a review of this item but the whole series not only are the films in this bundle not all musicals this bundle is sent intstead of the purchased bundle until amazon straightens out the mess in titles forget ordering alice faye and betty grable bundles particularly marquee musicals
0,the thing you are likely to use most is the nail clipper but it is very blunt and the special cover on the clipper makes cutting the nails impossible unless baby s nail is very very long if i wait until the nails are long enough to cut by this thing my month old would have scratched his face and head i end up buying a new baby nail clipper with a big handle and magnifying glass from nearby pharmacy that worked much better
1,i had been using this product for weeks now no problems discomfort quality stuff

0,all style and no substance even the dance number with john travolta uma thurman was lackluster and would cedric the entertainer please go away i ve never seen anything with him in it that was any good i should have known just by his presence in the movie it was going to be a dud i think christina milian s voice is good but not so great to make such a fuss over
0,our mfc worked fine until a paper jam inside the machine caused damage that couldn t be fixed by the sales technician lots of waiting for a response from brother at their call in website they waited out the warrenty will never buy from brother or amazon again as a result of this
0,when a movie producer in foregoes available spectrum of colors and technology opting to feed his audience grain black white and jittery gray the result had better be good that fraction of members of the technicolor drunk general viewing audience who will even stipulate to watch such a thing do so at decided perils of time and money push play alongside mr benefit of a doubt and strain to see if it works thus begins the argument of effect and more specifically that of color the problem with a black and white movie is that very few movies that resort to that despite some grand intention do not work or in the alternative do not work as well citing two examples sin city which is near tolerable acting paired with an absurd choice of black and white tantamount to robbery and good night america which is all and about the same the dilemma with black and white productions is that regardless of how well it comes together there seems always a thread of an argument in the back of one s mind that if one must resort to black and white to make one s point one might be better served as a charcoal artist color is the medium of life from a budgetary perspective black and white films save money as the challenges of color which in a good feature can be excessive are thus eliminated yet complications arise for instance i wasn t sure if that was blood or motor oil dripping from that guy s hand similarly the entire cast in sin city could have been wearing hot pink in shades of course and we would never know yet of course this is no excuse to dislike a movie or is it one wonders however that if pi production would have had more money would they have opted for color moot point it s done notwithstanding the obvious that i don t prefer black and white movies and incidentally don t know lots of people who do pi although a courageous artistic attempt with significant merits ranging from creative camera work clever symbolism and high octane guts seems to lanquish for other reasons despite pi s visceral intensity which is delibertaely hot wired throughout spinning out scenes that sizzle the nerves after max s third or fourth headache it gives up the ghost as as result the movie stays earthbound weighted down by a mediocre revolving door plotline obsessing man chases number grail looking for key to life while beset by outside forces including the recycling feeds of his own troubled mind unremarkable narrative with a gem here and there failing repetitive effect and thin uninspiring d support cast leaving the movie wanting for depth and intelligent character interplay unresolved imagery and scenes lent the impression that this creative endeavor was a bit out of control and ad hoc which is no fatal flaw in and of itself but in this case was signficantly detractive despite a reasonably decent stockpile of cinematic victories the battle wasn t won the themes inspiring pi have excellent potential however this movie trafficked the runway like an antiquated flying machine airborne one second belly down the next as a fine creative exercise the creators are praised for their effort and bravery pi is as bodacious as a skunk engaging rush hour traffic and commands the watcher s attention until that undefined moment when boredom sets in contains subterranean theme seedlings which likely served as brain fertilizer for the subsequent more advanced spin off a beautiful mind
0,as per the review i decided to buy the item i received it it was very thick and ugly looking it just looks good in the picture as mentioned by someone it has plastic back cover which makes it worse it also is very large and long so to remove the small braces cost more overall unhappy and returned to amazon with loss of money in shipping
0,well all i can say is don t buy it it does not shoot very well or hard just get a better gun
1,i just got this perfume for valentine s day i love it yes it is sweet smelling as another reviewer mentions but it s a pleasant sweetness cotton candy does describe it actually but who says grownups don t like smelling yummy there s a hint of vanilla as well and overall i think the combo is fantastic i love curious and now i love fantasy too they are two very different perfumes so it s easy to understand why a person can like one and not the other i will say though that fantasy lasts far longer than curious you can apply it in the morning and still smell it when you go to sleep which i don t mind at all i recommend this of course but i recommend you sample it before you buy just because you liked curious doesn t mean you will like this one
0,i don t understand the previous reviews i found this recording positively dreadful with ruthie henshall being the only one worth listening to john sinclair is abominable as george he sounds like he s doing a bad imitation of michael crawford in hello dolly he does strange things to his words i guess he s trying not to sound british but why is he singing summ ar weath ar instead of summer weather the ilona is a bass almost literally i resolve has been lowered for her and yet she still cannot master the range of the song to accomodate her the second part of i don t know his name has a truly odd key change were she remotely talented i could understand key changes to facilitate her singing but she s not worth it the orchestrations are odd too with strange sleigh bell sounds appearing frequently the rest of the singers range from fair kodaly a pretty voice but not much expression to bad mr maraczek drags down every single note of days gone by luckily this is his only song the broadway revival to my ear still has the best voices except of course that barbara cook the original outshines diane fratantoni who is merely good but who was a vast improvement over the roundabout s original amalia the annoying judy kuhn get the original or revival recordings instead this london version i would recommend only to die hard she loves me fans or masochists i d rather sit through another terrible viewing of you ve got mail than listen to this again
0,and what s the point all of these songs minus a few are on the anthology along with countless others the beastie boys didn t put this out their record label did it s just way for corporate to make money if you consider yourself a real beastie boys fan that is you re interested in all the other music they made that wasn t put on radio then don t buy this if you occasionally heard them on the radio and fight for your right is your favorite song then go ahead the beastie boys are much more than just their greatest hits to fully appreciate them you have to listen to an album all the way through
0,i bought this item thinking i was getting a healthy snack the fruit is soaked in high fructose corn syrup and it is extremely sweet not healthy

0,i have owned this monitor for a little bit over one year and it died on me right after the one year warranty expired the customer services rep told me that it will be for a repair which i can almost buy a new one if i pay the shipping on top of that i have other eight lcd monitors in the house and no one has such a bad quality i ll newver buy any proview products ever i will give zero star if there is one
1,billy elliot is an year old who does poorly in the boxing ring but surprisingly well in ballet class meeting with the boxers because of building shuffling needed during a coal miners strike this is the classic family doesn t initially understand teacher believes in him screws up audition but spirit carries him through type movie it s put together quite nicely and you never really know how it is going to turn out the transition from ballet dancing to tap jazz seemed to happen in one day which seemed jarring the beginning of swan lake with billy as the lead and family and friends in attendance years or so later was a real feel good part of the movie
1,i think this would work better with a money type clip however since verizon doesn t carry anything like this in clear this works
1,great magazine i use this magazine and go to http www buyacarforum com to learn everything about cars and to buy a new car try it out its great
1,when my baby was a newborn we left our closet light on all night at first so we could check on him it was also a jarring necessity to turn on the overhead light for diaper changes and feedings then i bought one of these lights and was impressed at the perfect amount of light it gives out just enough to see your baby by but not enough to keep everyone awake it s been almost a year now and i m just about to purchase two more we use the light now in our toddler s room and turning it on is now part of our bedtime routine we use it every night
0,this might work fine if you use a bike rack to transport your bike but i laid it in the back of my pickup and it snapped not very durable
0,i ordered this product from general discounters and i have tried for wks and still i have not gotten a response from them and i havent received my order as far as the actual cologne it is nice but order it from that company and you ll not get to smell it because you wont get it all other potential buyers of this cologne beware of the seller and make sure if its days or more late contact seller
1,this product blended well into my skin and i forget that i was wearing makeup what is amazing about avon is that their products are very economical and yet is of very high quality i am usually acne prone so i am careful about what i use on my face it is not oily and yet even dry skins can use it it is very matte and can be worn alone
1,this has minutes of the concert performed at symphony hall birmingham also has music videos don t pay the ferryman missing you separate tables
0,for the most part this is a good toy it was actually one of the easier items i took out of a box this week my daughter loves it and as long as you can tolerate the mommy daddy the wing fell off can you put it back on every minutes then it really is good i guess if your child is old enough and has the dexterity to put the wings back on by herself this toy would be great
1,quite tasty no flavorings in the rice but still a very nice light lunch can be a bit messy for those of us who are not skilled sushi roll wrappers i was planning on making this a regular part of my pantry but see that the price has just gone up changing it from a good value to not enough food for the money if the price goes down i ll buy it again but not for dollars a six pack
1,this is one of my favorite tasty bite entrées it is spicy hot but not at all too hot with a noticeable curry flavor the addition of the cashews makes for a nice flavor note although i could do without the whole chile pod i take mine in a mug with a pat of butter floating on top for a just before bed stomach warmer but you could easily pour it over rice for a quick easy and tasty lunch far more nutritious than a bowl of instant noodles by the way the combination of puréed greens and green peas is a terrific idea i d give this five stars if the peas weren t a little too redolent of the can and with the free shipping this is a terrific price
1,this is the second generation of this software i have owned it is a great navagation tool better than most online sites and can be used in the car i marvel at how up to date the roads shown are because in the lexington kentucky area we have had a lot of new growth with new streets and roads the software contains a lot of good eating and lodging places already placed on the map so you don t have to do a separate search to find a place to eat or spend the night major points of interest are also on the map
1,didn t work if you dont take the full recommended amount it may have helped me feel fuller but it didnt help me lose any weight i pulled out the old excersize bike and am plugging away at a low min a day now i still use it for the caffeien and possible apetite control benefit
1,my expertise actually is in rpg s but i ve always been a madden fan so i think my opinion can be usefull to someone wanting to know about this game this is your classic madden game very fun very addictive and very challenging franchise mode is the best feature basically you pick your team and then you decide how much to pay the players in order to keep under the salary cap which players to dump and rehire and pretty much everything else it takes to run a team which is a lot of things then their is the online mode where you play players from all over the country after you play all of the other modes this feature can keep you entertained clear until the next madden game comes out the only problem is that some online players know how to cheat ea sports strongly denies that it s possible to cheat online and many good players get mad when someone talks about cheaters online because the good players think that people who blame other s for cheating are just sore losers which is true a lot of the time however after personally seeing some of the things my computer nerd brother can hack into and do i think anything is possible on any website there are a ton of people out there that are a lot smarter than you and me and they can figure out how to cheat at anything finally the only reason that made me drop my rating from a star overall to a star overall the infamously not so popular superstar mode super star mode sucks you have to retry foreverrrrrrrrrrrrrr to get the pedigree parents you want on top of that you can t fully get your player to a high rating in all the categories that make a good player speed agility strenth etc you can improve the player s stats but never to where you eventually want to get them also when you finally get an agent that get s you access to the performance institute it doesn t do much good because using the performance institue only increases your stat s temporarily but i have some good news i ve heard through the grapevine that in madden this feature will be greatly improved you ll be able to run the yard dash so you can acually get a speed rating higher than a lousy you get to do the bench rep to decide your own strength so at least in madden you ll have more control of your player s skills this is the best thing about madden the people who make these madden games must have took notes when they learned about evolution in school every year madden adapts and improves the flaws in last year s game much like what football coaches do with their team s in real life the cool thing is that they actually take advice from their fanbase unlike most game companies when madden comes across a problem they adapt and fix the problem this game probably deserved a star overall rating instead of a star overall rating but when a video game company adds a new feature to a game it better be cool because it really pisses me off if they go through the trouble to add a new feature to get us all really excited and then the new feature ends up beeing stupid
1,if you are a ghits sac fan this dvd is a must series wise the dvd contains new episodes and the tachikoma stories are back as well in fact the tachikoma s are now back in action in the series too graphic wise gig drops the funny pastel look of the first season and returns to its dark look as it was in the first movie the cg is allot more fine tuned and the action is awesome the opener has also improved significantly for the series sound wise the series is awesome as usual dts japanese dts english with stereo for both and there are english subtitles if you chose to run it with japanese audio overall they squealed sac season perfectly this not a series to miss if you re a shell fan
0,this is one of the most boring films i ever watched there is nothing erotic in it the whole story is perverted with a poor innocent but very stupid woman submitting to the sadist fantasies of various lovers she is introduced i put inverted comas in lovers because none of them have a single tender erotic moment with her but instead they brutally beat her and rape her in the presence of others who seem to be totally oblivious to the proceedings
1,i read the other reviews on this bookholder and wasn t so sure about it however after buying and trying it out i have no regrets don t know why i waited soo long to get one dont be like me and wait until you start to feel some neck strain from hours of studying hunched over before buying one although made of plastic it is very study and has nice rubber feet to keep it from sliding the clips on the bottom work very well to keep pages open and you can change how firm or loose you want it to hold unlike other models this one folds completely flat so you can carry it in your backpack between books i have used it mostly for softcover textbooks and have no problem
1,my cousin in law is thai and she cooked an amazing curry for us i had to have the recipe and she said it was really very simple just get the green mae ploy curry paste some asian basil and some coconut milk a little salt sugar chicken some bamboo shoots and rice were the only other things i would need to make it well i couldn t believe it was really that simple but it was the paste imparts several subtle and delicious flavors to the curry tastes like you slaved for hours i never have leftovers when i make this curry the paste is so low priced i plan to stock up so i ll always have some on hand plus no preservatives no wierd ingredients it s all food stuffs albiet some of the ingredients i don t recognize what is a galangal whatever it all is sure tastes good
1,the cocoa is of superior quality as is all dean deluca products
1,early on in the game you use a pistol and rifle and take down some stormtroopers for the new republic as you explore their base with no force powers but events make a turn for the worse and you go to luke and request for your lightsaber back then you begin to discover force powers as you search out the dark jedi killer of your girlfriend for the rest of the game with amazing graphics and increddible duels this game is simply magnificent plus the multiplayer is awesome especially when you play ctf and give the other team a boat load of storm troopers you and your friend being rebels with one bot helping you against twenty or so stormtroopers makes the game a game you ll never want to trade in plus the duels are fun to play again and again i would have five stars but the game does have two or three puzzles that are quite difficult all in all a great game that any starwars fan must own any shooter fan really has to have and if you like both oooh you need it really bad
0,communism is one of the most evil ideologies in human history responsible for the extermination of million people this book which started it all holds at least much of the blame communists were and still are a threat to the free world and communism is a slave system some intellectuals actually support the tired mantras of marx s philosophy whether because they are insincere or simply pedants who haven t seen enough sunlight i don t know in any case if they ever step foot in the real world they would take note that communism denies private property and is totalitarian and slave driving the government owns everything including you and the deaths caused by communism are hardly necessary to bring up pol pot mao stalin of course etc etc who are these people kidding

0,i was very disappointed with the images produced by this camera i had hoped the ultra wide photos which was my main reason for going with this camera also would be ultra sharp but instead they tended to be soft the camera has a lag time of about of a second so it s more of a point shoot and wait camera the may be okay for posting internet images or enlarging to small prints but don t expect the sharpness typical of better quality cameras in my opinion the camera squeezes too much out of a jpeg photo by way of compression and shooting tif files just isn t practical i demand better image quality from my cameras and when zooming in i like to see detail i certainly don t like everything going soft
0,due the lower price of the charge i decide to buy it but it doesn t work on my sony ericson at all bad inversio

1,let me count the ways they re great for a quick energizing snack breakfast healthy dessert and tonight i even had one for dinner they are delicious and you feel good about eating them because they re good for you plus you get a lot of bang for a deceptively tiny ball they re very filling and only about calories genius
1,if you like smashing things this does the job nicely i smiled taking it out of the box it is quite heavy and large very nice open bowl with large capacity i highly recommend this as a workhorse warning you may need a second smaller mortar if you pour dump from your mortar often as this is very heavy but this is very handy for working with larger items or quantities

1,i have read other reviews here that this table is too high for and year olds maybe so but it is wonderful for year olds those in between stages kids who want to have a small table of their own but need something a bit taller and more sturdy than those made for toddlers my son almost and his big sister can both sit together and eat a snack at this table it is very sturdy the small drawer is great for crayons or stickers to be put out of the way at snack time the surface of the table is just the right size for imaginative play with puzzles or action figures the unique oval shape of the table takes up less room while still providing a good sized table top surface space my son had outgrown child size table and chair sets by age most are actually buit for toddlers this table is actually for kids and it has been a big hit at our home guess who s getting the matching lifestyle kitchen for christmas
0,with no mode settings repeat shuffle etc or shock protection this cd player is pretty undesirable but if you re just looking for something to hold you over then this ll do it has all the basic features of a cd player of course and it works alright it could be with just mine but every pair of headphones new and old that i use with it the left begins to malfunction although when using those same headphones in another cd player or speakers they work fine like i said if you just want a temporary thing then i guess this is good for you
0,if i could i would give this negative stars caveat emptor let the buyer beware i made the horrible and expensive mistake of buying this the beginning of feb i had to open the box to realize i needed to load it as administrator that was beyond my limited knowledge since it was opened i stupidly believed in their money back guarantee and got a return authorization it took forever and many calls they kept on lying on when the refund was mailed yes this went into april they insisted the mailing date was april on the i thought i d never get it they stopped payment and maybe issued another well i received the i am shafted on my state sales tax but because those idiots didn t put the name of my street it apprently was returned and what i got was postmarked april and they refuse to rescind the stoppayment sooooo i now need to pray i will ever receive the replacement horrible customer service i can t beleive these people sell accounting and contact software

1,i expected to learn how to build a gypsy wagon so i could join a caravan this movie did not help at all worthless i thought i would find a complex and riveting tapestry of deep and well developed characters and storylines what a disappointment i just knew i would come away with a better understanding of cutting edge business management techniques total waste of time instead i had to sit through a long film of incredible landscapes beautiful people and amazing music that altogether gave me a new and wonderful understanding of gypsies eurasia and history and i watched it about thirty times it s excellent i mean terrible whatever get it and watch it

1,my son and i thoroughly enjoyed assembling and learning about how robots work this kit may be frustrating for one adult or child to assemble the screws require more adult strength he would start them and i would finish and some of the instructions might need at least hands to hold and assemble but hey that is why it was so enjoyable we did it together it is fun now to watch him play with it and tell everyone my dad and i built this

1,we have had this sandbox for five years it has been durable and my two kids ages and just love it color of the plastic is still bright and has been under sun for years sometimes water seeps in when it rains but this makes sand play even funner for kids we tend to put a rock on top of lid to keep it in place though it does cover the box perfectly it is also nice that the lid is attached to the box itself and is easy for kids to remove and put back on when done the kids usually sit outside of it though it can accomodate small kids inside it as well i find most kids dont want to get sand all over and end up sitting outside of it regardless overall good investment and the kids love it
0,i didn t like the only other dean koontz book i ve ever read watchers but i enjoy reading kevin anderson s stuff so i thought i d give koontz another try because i m a reasonable person and i understand that not everyone can like everything by an author on to the review i realize that this book was initially meant to be a screenplay but i think the authors would have been wise to rewrite it instead of just tweaking it a little when the movie deal fell through the dialog is mind numbing and predictable every time there was a car scene i could guess what kind of conversation would be held you drive too fast are you my mother over and over and over the idea was good a modern day frankenstein or rather a frankenstein that had never died and had made it to present day yes i know frankenstein was the doctor not his monster but you get what i m saying but the dialog read exactly like a movie script would or like a play this book had so much potential but the authors laziness in not rewriting the entire thing after the movie wasn t made cost it dearly
0,i tried to watch this twice to see what the hype was i fell asleep both times not funny just slow boring and stupid way overated

1,our ranger rick issues are used first as reading material then discussion material then project material cut outs etc then recycling to neighbors who enjoy them just as much tear out posters line my son s walls there is no objectionable material in the magazine just wholesome fun reading no political agenda is discernable from it which is refreshing as soon as it comes in the mail my year old insists on sitting right down and reading the whole thing through the knowledge the magazine imparts carries over into the school day where his teacher is amazed at his recall and knowledge
1,it s pretty hard to argue against this at the prices we re seeing in short for not so much more than the high end of the bridge cameras panasonic dmc fuji you can have this camera with the kit lenses i imagine that you ll be very satisfied for paying the difference with pretty good kit lenses for under as of and an upgrade path to the e for all the lenses and accessories once you make that upgrade what s left to ask for except a faster burst mode and weather sealing that s is in body sswf and live view imho even if you re an entry level dslr user spend the extra and get the faster lens and get rid of the the lens the is a very nice lens with no real peers in the entry level dslr range as a kit lens that i could see without going party this lens put olympus over the edge for me for that speed of lens over that equivalent range i m not sure what else can compete on price if you have to have a faster lens for the longer zoom you could cough up the for the and even then that s a very very good price for that kind of lens and equivalent range the camera has full manual controls as expected from a dslr and can drive a newbie like me nuts but can also keep it simple with it s auto mode and numerous scene settings which i use a good deal if you get this camera imho don t bother with the xd cards they are very slow in comparison to the less expensive cf cards in this camera when it comes time to get a flash go the extra mile and get the olympus fl over the fl i m not sure that the fl s warranted at this price point i was lucky to find one cheap so i didn t have to research party flashes i confess to having been a pixel peeper and compared the high iso samples from this camera to the canons and nikons of the world it s definitely not bad in direct comparison but after you re done resizing and touching up the photos you ll never notice imho on the down side the raw files orf don t seem to be compressed and they re not exactly small at all in all not much to complain about here

1,i stumbled across this little gem almost by accident and what a surprise it was the sheer breadth of subject matter could span half a lifetime we never forget the lessons of our youth and each issue like a great short story will separate you from the mundane and transform the way you view literature and yes you will return time and time again are you trying to decide whether to devote your summer to reading anna karenina perhaps it will ignite in you a love for the great russian novels providing fodder that like all firm foundations could change the course of your life if it s the modern classics that you re interested in one almost can t help but think along the lines of john knowles life marches on and we choose whether to change or be changed much is out of our control in this world but what we choose to read is not regardless of your personal paradigm you will find much of interest in this cleverly constructed work while the idea of a holiday gift might seem obvious why not consider surprising and old friend with a subscription does your friend really need that springsteen coffee table tome even as a belated wedding gift it would no doubt be appreciated don t stand around in bookstores starbucks in hand flipping through page after page anymore oh you don t do that huh no neither do i just subscribe now i hope to find one in my mailbox soon timothy mcphail avondale estates ga
0,i had tried almost all the hemp protein products out there and love eating the powder raw but nutiva s product does not taste good at all compared to the other products it tastes like dirt and its not milled to a fine powder its very coarse so it will be crunchy if you decide to blend it with anything the only thing going for this product is that it packs in more fiber than other brands if your looking for a good tasting hemp protein go with living harvest manitoba harvest or ruth s hemp protein i eat hemp religiously so trust me take my advice and avoid this one bottoms up hemp powder is the most complete source of protein out there and easy to digest
0,this great underground master dj deservedly gets a release on a major record label but there are too many rappers not enough personality in the production and obvious restraint in the sampling surely the result of copyright clearance issues compared to z trip s amazing and audacious uneasy listening with dj p and live at the future primitive with radar this is just a bore yawn

0,i have had this camera since jan and have so far taken approximately shots while on trips and at weddings don t expect much from it and you will be happy as an entry level dslr it does what it s supposed to do in ideal conditions i find it s strength is in taking people photographs in bright light provided that they are not moving cons in landscape photography this camera is lacking both due to inadequate megapixels and it s inability to capture the natural blues and greens very well battery dies fast the battery i got with it hardly lasts a whole day of shooting especially when shooting in raw mode i have yet to fill up a card when shooting in raw mode approx shots before the battery dies surprisingly when shooting jpegs i get more shots per charge over but hardly enough to last a day i cannot tell you the number of times the battery has died on me while i was out on a hike so i always carry a backup film camera my trusty elan the viewfinder is very dim when i look through my elan and then through the it is painfully obvious how dark the image is through the s viewfinder in indoor situations with low light this becomes a handicap especially when having to resort to manual focus autofocus in low light for the is terrible when shooting indoors the autofocus hunts and ends up focusing on something behind your intended subject i have lots of beautiful photos of walls and sconces in the background in sharp focus while the people standing in front in the middle of the frame are an out of focus blur this is despite having a flash on my camera that uses an infrared beam to assist with the focus the flash is supposed to talk to the camera and adjust the power in order to ensure the subjects are not over or under exposed however with the this is a crap shoot at best and many of my indoor shots are over under exposed after about five months the shutter button started sticking i would click it and then it would remain depressed the shutter button would only pop back up after i jiggled it a little another annoying thing about the camera is that the settings are displayed on the rear of the camera and not on the top beside the shutter button and since there is only one thumbwheel it is not easy to change aperature and shutter speed for example if you use the thumbwheel to change the aperature then to change the shutter speed you would have to press another button while at the same time turning the thumbwheel when you take thousands of shots over the life of the camera this is a real annoyance so would i recommend this camera if you are a casual point and shoot person it s an affordable entry into dslrs that produces decent photos but if you plan on shooting a lot indoors or want to take landscape photographs that can actually convey the colors accurately look elsewhere
1,we purchased a starter piece set for my girl when she was years old she absolutely loved it because it was easy to use and build she had a hard time with the legos type blocks because it was more frustrating for her to pull them apart we then expanded to this piece and she is able to be even more creative it is an excellent lerning toy not as simple as it seems
0,i remember hearing about this book by the great patriot sean hannity sometime in then it was a mere idea from that time on until august i waited for what i thought would be the greatest book of all time i remember seeing the cover art and hearing about the title let freedom ring with not just a picture of sean hannity on the cover patriot that he is but also a flag i loved it couldn t be more happy well the day of the book s release i took a day off work i ve never missed a day of work before in my life and rushed to get this book it looked better than i ever imagined with the flag on the cover and the title of let freedom ring i thought finally technology has caught up to our patriotism i expected a book filled with flags flags with sound effects maybe some firework sound effects boy was i wrong i opened the book only to the colors black and white no red no blue no stars and stripes i quickly turned the pages looking searching for flags i found none no sound effects either no fireworks at that point i went into a year long depression i nearly committed suicide at several points it s only now that i can bring myself to review this man s book patriot that he is i say this so you know what you re getting yourself into there are no flags no stars and stripes no fireworks no sound effects i have since recovered but only because of old stars and stripes i went back to teaching last year not fully recovered and my colleagues knowing how much i love america and the stars and stripes suggested i have my class do a research project find the most patriotic book ever made the methodoloy was simple a book made out of flags with flag pictures would score high a book that was not made out of a flag or flags and had no pictures of flags would score the lowest we found some very good books and they did cheer me up the one that was the most patriotic by far was a book called president jesus how jesus wrote the constitution freed the slaves and won world war ii its published by a small church in texas i was very proud of my students for finding it it has brought countless joy to my life along with the book made entirely out of a flag with flag pictures and written in blue and red ink you get a giant flag i m not sure of the dimensions but they had to haul it to my house in a moving truck i ve draped it over my house and it covers it completely people even have to crawl under the flag to enter the house now i often go outside and just gaze at old stars and stripes for hours at a time smiling
1,cold weather will be with us for a while and nothing makes one feel warmer than being wrapped in a delicious flowery fragrance that certainly is chanel no it s a blend of white flowers that has resulted in a scent which is both sweetly innocent and sensuous continuing in their use of symbolism and numbers after the overwhelming success of chanel no coco chanel and ernest beaux developed yet another fragrance naming it no for the year it was presented it may have been created in but it s as up to the minute as tomorrow especially in the new spray
0,i bought this tool after reading all of the glowing reviews i thought this would be a good way to save money by sizing my watches rather than paying each time to have a professional do it i was so disappointed in this tool the link remover only pushes the pins out halfway you are instructed to take a pair of tweazers to pull the pin out the rest of the way as you can imagine this is not easy my husband ended up scratching my watch as he struggled to pull the pins out knowing what i know now i would definitely have invested in a different link remover
1,i have had one of these for years but recently purchased a second one because i was having to move them between the rv and house this case on the newer version is so much better and the second handle is a great improvement every outdoor person or cook should have a deluxe blade trader in their set
1,this is a good compact flash card this is faster than most cameras can handle so there was no real reason to go with faster cards that are much more expensive
0,if you ve seen the movie cars and figure that it s time that you gave your rusty bucket the radiator springs make over special you might just be tempted to get yourself a batch of this stuff to make it smell as good as it looks sure it says new car scent and it has a picture of a car and a nice ribbon and everything but i would definitely not use this stuff in my car first of all it doesn t smell anything like the interior of a new car and inhaling this stuff in that small an area would be lethal even if you drive a hummer it is super concentrated and a one second blast is enough to saturate a ft x ft room with an unpleasant chemical smell which might just be able to eliminate you and yours along with the airborne bacteria smoke and odors i can t vouch for any of the claims of air cleansing sanitizing bacteria reduction or removal of smoke and odors because after the first test spray in my office on a friday afternoon i vacated the premises under duress and by monday morning it had thankfully dissipated i ve never used it again and even though it may conceivably be the best airborne germ killing thing gummy ever invented the smell makes it impossible to use in the presence of living breathing people to be fair the write up never actually states that it is for cars instead listing schools medical facilities and food processing areas but then why on earth would you want any of these places to smell like a new car and why would you need a one ounce bottle of product for your factory the claims of deodorizing and leaving a fresh fragrance certainly didn t happen for me and unless you come from somewhere where the pollution smells worse than this i couldn t recommend it amanda richards july
1,joan crawford had it star quality when i first saw her in grand hotel i was surprised how much i was watching her character instead of the equally riveting character played by the great greta garbo both were stars but crawford was able to project a different kind of sensuality than garbo a vulnerability a plucky girl next door quality in humoresque an older crawford was still able to achieve this level of performance paired off with the younger male star let s face it women have a great advantage acting perhaps women are always acting besides being better looking than men they can emote more without going out of gender role a distinct advantage vis a vis men who must restrict their emotional range or be accused of over acting it s a horrible thing to fall in love and that is just what crawford s character does falls in love with the worst of all possible choices a musician musicians only love music the music in the film is worth the price of admission alone who amongst you would throw the first stone at a fine violinist playing zigeunerwisser or any of the other fine war horses of the classical violin repertoire she falls in love with the young artist of the month whom she offers to help jumpstart his career renting a concert hall for his first recital she is married to a wealthy but understanding man who loves her but lets her do what she wants drinking philandering most men do what she wants and accept her ridicule the character of the musician does not he s a tough new yorker who gives her as good as he gets and she finds herself loving him despite herself love is madness and when he starts being successful with his concert tours but neglects to phone her for weeks she falls apart emotionally it is profoundly humiliating to realize someone else can hurt you badly simply by declining to keep in touch silence is the perfect expression of contempt isn t it she drinks she mopes about her cottage in the hamptons she is crazy in love with a man who doesn t seem to reciprocate her feelings in our time she might see her doc and get a prescription for zoloft to be rid of the lovesick blues and of obsessive thoughts of him but this is before thorazine even and she s just out of luck there so she drinks drinking was the preferred way to deaden the unbearable pain of rejection in love in the days before designer drugs were available from your neighborhood spice man to complicate things her musician had an old girlfriend from the conservatory where he studied music as a young man additionally there was the dreaded american mom in full armor she just had to tell this grown son of hers repeatedly that the woman he finally fell in love with was no good she even slaps him upside the head as he shows her around his ritzy new apartment with a view it seems he has too many portraits of crawford s character in view that s the way mom make your boy marry a good girl like you maybe meanwhile and i just love a line the character played by oscar levant comes up with at her cottage in the hamptons you re not the kind of woman who lets her husband get in the way of her marriage a lot funnier said than written levant did a lot of great piano playing in the film dropping dozens of one liners like that he almost stole several acts this is a very forties film in black and white whatever happened to the colorization process oh well finally mom tells the rich girl to keep her hands off her son and dutifully crawford s character retreats to her cottage in the hamptons gets drunk one last time wades into the surf in a stunning shimmering black cocktail dress and is never seen again i told you love was dangerous her lover after cancelling one measly concert out of despair at her death decides not to ruin a promising career and returns to the concert stage men emotional iqs of at most well that s all folks if your eyes were still dry at the end of this film you re safe you ll never fall in love

1,i am a computer repair tech and i can bet of the problems reported in these reviews for this product is because people double install security programs you should never install more than antivirus program into your os most of the decriptions of problems are from doing just that double installs please please remove uninstall any previous antivirus programs and party firewalls then reboot use a good registry cleaner freeware program like ccleaner to remove leftover registry keys then reboot again and then and only then install your new antivirus security program i have this program and when installed properly on a cleaned system it works great a very good product at a very good price i can t comment on it s tech support i have never used it

1,i ve had this product for almost a year now i have very thick frizzy hair and have spent my life getting it relaxed every six months and blowing drying it straight i ve never used a straight iron because they could never handle my hair but with this one i have not needed a blow dryer since i got it now my hair is straighter than it has ever been in my life which i thought i would never see of course this makes it very straight so i can t get any shape or curls from it which is what i was going for cut my drying time by almost hours as long as i apply some protective serum on when still wet great product and still going strong
1,like her legendary mother nobody around today takes command of the stage like liza minnelli and this legendary event at new york s radio city music hall clearly illustrates this always a five star event in concert i have been fortunate to experience this thrilling and amazing performer numerous times in concert from to and i am here to say that she has still got it and always will in recent years for some silly reason that i don t get the media has tried to damage liza s artistic credibility but it doesn t work when liza takes to the stage and shows sold out audiences with her soulful singing and great performing skills what she is all about and that she is and always will be a true legendary superstar numerous standing ovations later it is clear that liza is going to be around for a long time to come and this tremendous concert is a keeper bravo liza and keep on rocking
1,i ve been using metal detectors for around years now my first detector was a bounty hunter quickdraw ii a very fine easy to learn detector that s a real workhorse i learned most everything i know about metal detecting from personal experience and from reading lots of posts and asking lots of questions at the bounty hunter forum http www detecting com i shopped around and found the bounty hunter land ranger as a factory shipped model no extras except and coil for for that price i couldn t afford not to buy it when the land ranger lr arrived it was in pieces and extremely easy to assemble the manual that comes with the lr gives you the basic information you need to get started detecting with the lr but is a bit general when it comes to explaining what each of the functions do if you just want a turn on and go detector the land ranger may not be for you if this is the case i would recommend getting an easier to learn detector such as the bounty hunter quickdraw ii or even the bounty hunter tracker iv should you later decide to get the land ranger your first detector will make an excellent back up detector and a great detector for a friend or family to use with you what i would recommend is going to the bounty hunter forum website listed above to learn way more information about various detectors and their various functions than i could ever begin to explain here even though i had been detecting for a while my first trip out with the land ranger was quite overwhelming and somewhat frustrating due to the much greater sensitivity of this model the added features it has and an the information overload of tones responding to mineralized ground conditions trashy areas many pulltabs screwcaps etc and a condition know as falsing tones due mostly to incorrect sensitivity settings and improper ground balancing the initial experience that i describe here is very common with first time land ranger users and is frustrating but will get much better with practice and with the more one learns about detecting in general and about the land ranger in particular as i use the land ranger now i have learned much about settings what to ignore and what to watch for to indicate which targets may be worth digging once past the information overload that will happen i assure you the user will begin to appreciate the sensitivity of this detector learn the proper settings begin finding more and more valuable items or targets as they are called and become one with this detector i purchased the bounty hunter land ranger for it s very sophisticated microprocessor features including target id vdi numeric readout indicating target conductivity tone id it s automatic manual ground balancing programmable target accept reject all metals no motion pinpoint mode self tuning motion all metals mode good for deep hunting of relics caches and or gold nugget shooting and for the reputation of bounty hunter detectors but mainly for the excellent price of such a full featured professional metal detector i love being able to put this baby to work discriminating out trash items while ringing in sharp and clear when locating coins and jewelry the land ranger is also ideal for hunting relics and for gold nugget shooting although i have not done much of either of these yet soon i hope i also love the fact that two coils standard and nugget coil come stock with the land ranger and i also have a coil that i purchased for around it s important to have several coil sizes available for various types of hunting the price of additional coils for many other brands of detectors is astronomical so this was an integral part of my decision to get a bounty hunter rather than some other brands i love how lightweight this detector is i love knowing that i have a sophisticated detector that will not miss items that are buried deep how deep depends on the size of object type of metal soil conditions etc generally the lr will detect to a depth of around deep for a coin sized target believe me you won t want to dig too many objects that deep most targets are right around deep due to how coins jewelry etc tend to migrate down into the soil this varies of course but in general a greater number of objects are somewhere in this depth range what i hate about the land ranger is that parts of the manual give a very general description of certain features like the ground monitor meter or self tuning all metals mode i wish that the land ranger were waterproof or at least water resistant it is not and i highly recommend that you do not use it in the rain without a good plastic cover that fits securely around the control housing in conclusion i highly recommend the land ranger for any seasoned detectorist or for a novice detectorist that is willing to devote a good deal of time and a fair amount of patience to mastering the many nuances of this full featured detector the land ranger hosts target id vdi numeric readout tone id depth meter battery meter ground monitor meter sensitivity meter and target indicator it has touchpad controls for sensitivity accept reject discrimination all metals no motion pinpoint mode factory preset modes all

0,we got this set for my year old son for christmas his eyes lit up when he saw it he dropped everything and insisted that we open it right away we didn t of course we waited a whole day thank goodness it literally took an hour to put together there are so many pieces that look alike but are barely different it was very frustrating then it wouldn t stay together once it was finished it has been nothing but a frustration for him and me ever since he gets so upset when he tries to play with it we saved the box it s going back if they will take it

1,pros reduces flare and ghosting when shooting in bright light helps protect your lens from dirt and scratches somewhat protects the lens in case of a fall better to break the hood than the front element makes you look more like you know what you are doing and helps keep others from carelessly walking in front of you cons will increase lens movement in windy situations kind of like a sail on a boat takes up more room in your bag even when reversed they still add to the diameter of the lens people take more notice of you will help to blow your cover if you are trying to keep a low profile

0,when i rented twentynine palms i knew it would showcase bruno dumont s taste for dispassionate portrayals violence of various sorts and shock in spite of this mental preparation this very atmospheric film built to a grotesque resolution that left me a seasoned viewer rattled unfortunately the shock and awe that the film achieves is short lived twentynine palms is modeled on the horror film but like many of its american cousins the horror it achieves failed to haunt me the film as a whole left me with an unsettled feeling as if a cynic had just talked my ear off i also had the sense that this was more about the worldview of the director rather than the world his film creates sam peckinpaw s straw dogs is in ways a similar but superior film i can admire straw dogs based on its many strengths so long as i avoid viewing it as the man as animal fable that peckinpaw intended it isn t that i disagree with his view of humans as domesticated animals i see the film as a rare example of violent drama and technical virtuosity transcending the simplicity of its maker s defense whether peckinpaw has a point or not seems beside the point of course the trick with any argument is in having good evidence in pressing one s point of view there is almost inevitably an artful description of a scene one that reflects the viewer s position in this way films have the strange ability to create their own myths their own arguments to invest a film with one s views too forcibly can dull the work s independent life its peculiar logic with the sententiousness of fables watching twentynine palms it seems impossible to avoid questioning dumont s personal views this is because so many of the events described in the film are implausible lacking believable characters and action one naturally develops a sense that the director is revealing something to us that we haven t seen something unique to his vision if the strange behavior of the two principles was about their uniqueness and their relationship e g as outsiders then why would dumont undercut their characterization denying us a belief in them as individuals or more profoundly as points of identification i gradually came to view the two principles as an every couple with private rhythms and misunderstandings that might appear absurd if made public this seemed like a worthy focus but dumont forces it to play against a theme of violence both seen and unseen the violent atmosphere of the film was something i couldn t account for until the resolution and even then with difficulty toward the end of film we re given a horrific equation of two orgasms that of the male protagonist and that of his rapist the film s principle antagonist aside from the desert both orgasms are shown to be dangerous powerful and unspeakable or at least not clearly worded this equation discounts the context in which the orgasms occur leaving the viewer with no reliable distinction of the protagonists from their insanely hostile environment clearly the bourgeois carefree lifestyle of the couple is set up to be cut down a horror convention but dumont makes the attack personal in the most perverse way from early in the film on the protagonists suggest an inner horror which is unmitigated by their lovemaking and perhaps even feeds on their relationship the irrationality of their environment makes the couple our most recognizable guides on this strange road trip but they demonstrate their own measure of insanity the male half of the couple betrays an undercurrent of sadism that eventually explodes as an act of sexualized murder the female s deviance is less clearly defined but there are several scenes in which she is shown inviting harm if our trip as it seems is through a kind of anti eden and our guides are an every couple with no structured identity of their own then their deviancy would suggest a kind of universal infection or nature rather than an aberration of character this would also render the criminality of the final scenes uncertain in light of their amoral setting some would say that the best criterion for judging a horror film is whether it horrifies regardless of how this is an unsettling film it is also an especially tasteless one in watching this dvd it may be useful to some viewers that dumont can be found rationalizing his use of violence indeed his violence as an artist in an interview in a director s statement and in the course of the film itself
1,i recently purchased the anime studio but not the pro version which costs more and gives more functionality this is a fully functioning animation software with lots of interesting features i can see no reason that a novice animator such as i am would not be happy with this software i would like to see more energy put into a manual but you can scavenge the anime blog chat site to find answers or google other places with a more robust manual this would be stars not it is really the reason i am reluctant to upgrade to pro because i would want more lessons and tutorials to go along with the upgrade if you have an interest in animating this is the software for you
1,a wonderful movie which deserved all the awards which were bestowed upon it it is refreshing to view great movies with wonderful stories minus bad language and nudity as a big fan of greer garson i must comment on jane bedinger s review in which she claimed that ms garson was having an affair with the actor who played her son ms garson fell in love with and married richard ney about a year after the movie was made i don t see how ms bedinger could consider this an affair

0,the only redeeming quality about this gps system is that it s cheap i used it on a mile trip on the east coast the week after i got it the navigation is poor i found that i often had to look over to the laptop screen because i was off route so often due to the poor maps the system repeated the same annoying problems that i see in other feedback the unit would show me being off the road even though i was on an interstate in this case it would continually recalculate the route and diretc me to take exits to get off the highway and circle around it directed me to make turns onto one way streets in the wrong direction it could not locate a poi that turned out to be a few hundred yards away it often did not know the correct side of the road for my destination it doesn t provide a chime when it s time for a turn it will tell you the turn is a half mile ahead but that might be the last time you hear an instruction in one case it got me to my destination at least close enough but couldn t guide me back to my starting point the gps receiver seemed to acquire and hold the satellite signal well but the maps are poor as is the verbal instruction it sounds like a s computer generated voice if you re looking for a trustworthy guide in unfamiliar areas this isn t it this is going back asap
0,what a waste of money not only was it just average in size but it was made of incredibly flimsy really cheap plastic
1,it s a nice pool a pain in the ass to blow up without a pump but oh well lol it s a good tuy over all to have and holds a lot of water it s just hard to dump it all out once you re finished that drain hole should be on the side and not on the bottom of the pool
1,this is a great light perfect for a be seen and backup light in addition to a stronger source the plastic handlebar mount failed on mine the first time out apparently cracking from vibration fatigue the customer support from princeton was terrific though and they sent a replacement mount i contacted them on friday and had the part monday i may try to rig a velcro strap through the clip and attach that directly around the bar instead of using the supplied part
0,these diapers are the most awfulest things i think i ever bought for my baby i received a lot of the swaddler size for my baby shower and i tried to use them for about weeks before my pediatrician pinpointed it as the source of the relentless diaper rash my son had pretty much from birth stopped using them and lo and behold diaper rash gone fast forward months later when my son was hospitalized for a week and these were the only diapers the hospital supplied figuring that my son was older maybe they wouldn t do as much harm wrong the rash came back with a vengeance i had to get diapers from home for the rest of the stay i think it s because they are lightly scented with green dye inside definitely stay away if your child has sensitive skin
0,sometimes you get a good bargain cheap price for a good quality shoe this case is a classic you get what you pay for cheap price for a cheap shoe this shoe is very heavy for a comfort shoe no arch support whatsoever the rubber is almost too thick i have serious doubths that this is a leather shoe feels like cheap vinyl at best days into wearing them and it looks like my shoe is going to rip in half any minute this paper like vinyl leather is pretty thin and cheap looking this is by fat the worst pair of skechers i have owned this is my pair

0,hideaway bought for my daughter who loves it easily assembled up within seconds i have noticed that there are two loops attached to the hideaway presumably to tie some rope to them and then stake to the ground there was no rope or stakes with the purchase i am unaware if these should have been included two entrances into the hideaway the front inverted t entrance is great however the rear is a porthole type entrance not good for children when playing games as they can trip on the material in the bottom material not that durable but with care there should be no issues a lot bigger than it looks on the site which was a nice surprise
1,i purchased this item when my daughter was one year old and it was amazing my daughter was always a good sleeper but when she began teething at around months old she began refusing to stay in her crib each night i was out of ideas and my husband and i had tried just about every method we read about without success finally i found the tomy star bright light and it was like a miracle worker the first night i used it my daughter put herself to sleep in her crib by staring at the ceiling each night her sleeping became better and better now we only run it once for minutes and she falls asleep it is a much better approach then allowing your child to cry it out she actually enjoys going to sleep now and looks forward to watching the light show before she falls asleep
1,first of all let me preface this by stating that i literally just put this product on minutes ago i have had a chemical peel over a week ago and was given retin a and therefore my face was peeling so horribly that i thought i couldn t leave the house i mean my makeup would literally come right off i was horrified i tried several moisterizers sometimes multiple ones but could still see the skin flaking off onto my desk so i researched this and went to sephora and bought a kit i washed my face did the serum and added this product and i honestly do not see single flake of dry skin it does tingle but i think it s because my face is raw and so dry but it feels as if my skin is drinking it up like a cold glass of water i am anxious to see what happens in the weeks to come i have mild cyctic acne and have struggled with it for years i decided to see a dermatolist and then got chemical peels it helped to rid me of the bad acne but then i was so dry for wks i couldn t bare to even look at myself my skin doesn t hurt anymore for allthe sensitive people there is a sensitve version but if you have dry skin from the crazy acne treatments they make us do or peels or just dry winter heat this is the product for you if it seems strong then use it every other night until you skin can adapt or just once a day i hope you find this product helpful like i did becaus i am still looking in the mirrow that s at my desk

1,this smells so wonderful wear it and you will get compliments it seems like it might be a summertime only scent i e very tropical but i d wear it year round i only wish they made a larger size in the oil
1,this is a well written thoughtful film charlie hunnam pete really stands out to me he s perfectly cast compelling to watch and completely sells the mentality of a devoted hometown fan who has the back of all his mates it was especially interesting to watch his relationship with elijah wood s character evolve the whole concept of an american being immersed in the british football scene is a unique one and i think it was pulled off really well the lessons that elijah wood learn and the ultimately sentimental tone of the film make this a must see
1,in the mid columbia released a trio of nifty black and white monster movies it came from beneath the sea earth vs the flying saucers and million miles to earth aimed squarely at the youth market each of these films run less than an hour and a half and are brave and spunky as they feature a human race that always survives and is better as a result of the battles with the monsters most importantly each has spectacular special effects by the master ray harryhausen in the years before computer generated graphics monsters were either created by very sophisticated cartoons or in the case of harryhausen a technique called stop action in which models would be shot a frame at a time natural movement was suggested by moving the figures slowly frame by frame this was time consuming painstaking arduous and for non fans pretty cheesy but the cheesiness is in a way more than half the fun populated by such grade b through z performers as hugh marlowe faith domergue and william hopper these movies are a comfy as a pair of old slippers and a well worn robe these quick morality tales are a hoot and holler a campy yet and faintly embarrassing art form that demands the cliché so bad that they re good

1,i had a heck of a time trying to find a bra that would not slip off my shoulders and would support my breast this one did both this bra supports me better than my sports bra and it gives a beautiful shape to the bustline i was looking for a well rounded shape not conical or ski sloped the key is to get a propper fit i went from a to a not that my sized changed just getting a well fitted bra if you can pull the band more than an inch from your body you are wearing the wrong bra size it is supposed to be snug to hold everything in place it takes a little getting used to wearing something that tight but i don t bounce jiggle or pull up falling bra straps anymore i bought two in september and went back and purchased more in october and when these wear out i will purchase the exact same thing i hand wash or machine wash on delicate after each wearing with a lingerie soap and line dry they still look band new i was a little concerned with that itty bitty plastic front closure bursting with the band being so snug but they are still holding it all together i was also concerned about the sheer fabric lasting but i haven t had any tears rips runs or poked through any of them yet
1,seems sturdy however it did not fit my tv will not fit samsung lns
0,most other reviewers listed here believe that this cd is good i wonder if the fantastic and marvelous nature of the legendary mannheim concerts and the joyous nature of earlier mannheim cd s have made it difficult to critique a mannheim offering i am a student of all sorts of music and have been my entire life and this particular cd sounded to me like one long track of exactly the same music just with different chords in fact if i was not paying specific attention i couldn t tell when one song ended and another started i enjoyed what i heard but i was certainly expecting more from this cd many of these disney songs could have easily lent themselves to more spectacular stylings at the very least some variety seems to have been called for disney has always included great music with their movies running the gamut of musical styles such as classical jazz blues and even hip hop so maybe my problem was that my expectations were too high i do however highly recommend mannheim cd s in general just not this one
1,hollywood make them then they break them stars can fall as fast as they rise sometimes they rise again and sometimes they disappear and christopher guest casts a jaded eye on the fickle ups and downs of hollywood in the big picture a quirky cynical movie which focuses on what the successful should never let go of it has a few awkward stretches but overall it s a darkly witty cult comedy you re tracking failure all over my carpet nick chapman kevin bacon is the winner at an arty student movie competition and instantly agents are chasing him all over l a in no time he s the rising young director with a movie deal at a major movie corporation but he s also starting to lose sight of his old life as he tries to become a major success he changes the style plot and characters of his arty movie for demographics turning it into a beach bums naked ghost movie he dumps his pretty girlfriend emily longstreth for a bimbo actress teri hatcher when the studio head gets dropped nick falls as quickly as he rose but a chance encounter with an old pal gives him a second chance an arty music video this time can he get it right christopher guest is best known for his brilliant mockumentaries tackling everything from small town musicals to folk festivals his forthcoming one is another one about showbiz but his talents are just as present in a typical movie and guest does a smart quirky job of it the lesson be true to yourself and your art don t fall for empty glitz and don t let success go to your head if you re lucky enough to get it the story is a pretty straightforward one nick gets great success it goes to his head he falls and he rises again a wiser man and the movie falls into straightforward lines without many unpredictable plot twists at first glance it doesn t seem that unusual what makes it special well simply put guest manages to infuse it with his unique type of wit like the oddballish pez music video and the noir fantasies of nick s life not to mention the glorious dialogue when speaking of nick s one n only music video a studio woman announces it s the best one yet and i ve seen em all and guest manages to show us agents artists students directors and actors but never descended to cliches they re real people no matter how nasty and bacon does a solid job as a young man who learns how empty glitz is his best scene is the reunion with his friend emmet where he confesses i wanna be your friend again and he s backed by good performances by longstreth michael mckean and a dancing jennifer jason leigh big picture treads where many movies have gone before but it does so with an approach as fresh as a pez people music video a must see
0,was excited about this after reading the reviews but it is so small and imho did not produce enough moisture in the air to warrant the pricetag after buying it and trying it i went out and bought a larger one barely ever use this
0,i tried putting this on a shopping cart from target this does not cover area at all i caught my baby biting on the cart handle and almost flipped not good plus its annoying to put on

0,my boyfriend bought this for me not realizing that my camera came with a case i have the this case isn t a good fit for the camera and i ve never used it because of that
1,this box set is worth every penny this is an absolute must have if you meet the following eligibility requirements you have a decent tv at least and are able to watch in the dark you have surround stereo sound you love i bought this set a few years ago but unfortunately i made a big mistake i bought the horror collection which works except that the movies are horrible and hard to watch then a friend of mine turned me on to the three movies in this set recently encounter alien adventure haunted castle and i was simply blown away now i can not stop watching these movies the movies are all made by nwave pictures and boy have they done a fantastic job informative fun and of the highest quality this is the definitive package kids will love and so will adults also once you have the lcd shutter glasses they will work on any field sequential movie you can get your hands on these movies are thrilling though especially the non stop coaster rides in each one do you hear what i am saying buy this now you can thank me later stars if i could and of course highly reccomended

1,after reading several reviews of this product i was skeptical about buying this cable i wanted a better cable then the composite rca cables that came with my but i was not sure about paying the price for these when the sony cables are about half the cost of the monster cables the reviewers commenting on the cable not fitting into the properly and the component connectors being too tight to fit onto the tv almost discouraged me from even buying this product i decided to bite the bullet and purchase these cables for my i am very happy that i decided to buy these cables the cable connector fits perfectly into my better than the connector on my original sony cables even the connectors fit nicely onto my tv they are snug but not too tight i believe they fit snuggly onto the component jacks on my tv because of the cut turbine connector which fits better than a standard rca plug the video and audio from my is unbelievable my pushes the video signal to my lcd hd tv at with these cables with my stock composite cables the graphics in my games were grainy and sometimes blurry now the graphics are crisp and clear and i only wish i would have bought these sooner the display from my and games fits nicely onto my tv in widescreen now too before the picture was not centered on my tv and sometimes parts of my game screens would be off the screen i would recommend these cables to anyone who wants to improve the video and sound quality of their over the stock sony cables there are other monster cable versions for the available so choose the one that is right for you but if you want something that is moderately priced don t need digital audio via fiber and the next best thing to hdmi than this is the cable for you i am going to get the monster component cables for my next so i will be able to hook it up when i don t have hdmi available for it to use one more thought be sure to change the video output on your from rgb to y cb pb cr pr in the system configuration before hooking up your with these cables or it may not work my tv told me the connection was not supported and i did not have video output until i changed the video output setting on my

0,i knew that this concert dvd was an acoustic show so i wasn t surprised that the tempo was slow at the beginning but to start the show with gilmour tuning his guitar was a bit much once he did start playing gilmour was having such a hard time finding his rhythm that i found myself praying for the drums to kick in by the time things settle down the really glaring problem with this dvd comes to the surface the mix is horrible the crowd noise drowns out gilmour at times when they cheer a song they recognize he is almost inaudible when talking between songs and at many points the backup singers completely cancel him out i found myself constantly adjusting the volume which really takes away from the concert experience there are high points in the show but the low points are rock bottom comfortably numb is a song that millions of people know by heart two versions are provided on this dvd from the concert and in the bonus section neither of the guest singers robert hewitt and sir bob geldoff know the words have to read from sheet music and based on their phrasing have never heard the song before gilmour would have been better off asking for a volunteer from the audience the very best thing on this dvd is oddly enough in the bonus section screamin jay hawkins i put a spell on you a blues standard performed with mica paris and jools holland almost makes the dvd worth buying almost watch jonathan demme s beautiful treatment of neil young heart of gold if you really want to see a great acoustic show that is the gold standard

0,no reviews for this video as the disk i have got has nothing recorded on it and it has a flat and rough gray inside surface with no silver surface of recorded movie and when inserted into the player a message of no disk is displayed as the shipping cost is to be born by the buyer in case a dvd is defective and in my case the shipping cost is much more than the dvd as i have to ship in from india so i can just throw it in the garbage bin and suggest you guys that kindly watch out for this disk
1,i purchased this game for my year old who already reads a little and knows her numbers well i hoped this game would help her learn addition she loves to play it but several of the games require hand coordination beyond her ability the hand cart one in particular as noted by another reviewer and catching bubbles it was frustrating to me because she knew the proper answer but could not execute because her movements were too slow over time she has improved enough to play most of the games on level one the game is very engaging ang the graphics well done but the educational part is under emphasized the game that teaches addition involves frogs jumping to lily pads and my daughter is so focused on the frogs that the addition lesson is hardly noticed
0,i must say you are getting a very good price and these are very comfortable you also do not notice anything irregular however i ordered these to use as boxers that is to wear them around the house not a good plan these are very thin plus the fly is very narrow all in all not very useful for my intended purpose
0,come on this is twinkies aren t food anymore than cheez whiz is twinkies were invented back in the before science understood the impact of the product on our bodies consider that in those days doctors were used to advertise cigarettes in magazines everyone needs a sugar fix every once in a while i m just as guilty of that but eating twinkies is practically self mutilation look at the ingredients list and do some reading yikes everyone s family deserves tasty snacks that happen to be healthy too sorry hostess that definitely does not include twinkies

1,hayley westenra at only years old is an enchanting voice we should be hearing from for many years to come this is an uplifting and at times spiritual album that shows shades of greatness throughout westenra s voice is captivating though the musical scores are at times sub par and do not equal the vocal talent there was an advertising tag on this cd that stated the female josh grobin but i think a more accurate sentiment would be a young sarah brightman odyssey is a fine mix of spiritual and operatic tunes all of which match up well with westenra s abilities bocelli fans will also appreciate the duet dell amore non si sa they pair up for that one song but the rest is all westenra this is smooth soothing and easy listening if you like brightman you will truly appreciate the voice of westenra
1,i have some doubts that this product gets anywhere near the range it advertises but it works nonetheless and really considering that my router is in the basement and on the other side of the house i figure i ought to be grateful that it works at all i do suffer from fairly frequent disconnections but i suspect it s related to where i have things in the house no so much the product in fact i can usually view numerous wireless connections used by my various neighbors that this device picks up install went quickly and easily on my winxp pro machine it s compact and conveinient to hook up to the desktop and laptops as needed can t complain especially for the price

1,dr amen has changed my life and the lives of several members of my family the stigma associated with mental illness is deep seated and difficult to overcome understanding the root causes particularly the genetic predisposition within families is the indispensable first step in coming to grips with dealing with life long problems these problems are often not adequately addressed via behavior modification or cognitive therapies because they get the cart before the horse they do not deal with the biological root causes once those are dealt with the learned behaviors and habitual patterns can be peeled away to create a whole new start on life however without the understanding of the causes and types of underlying brain conditions one is often doomed to the roll the rock up the same hill only to see it roll down again as we watch take my advice if the brain pattern descriptions look all too familiar get help as recommended you will become a new person the one you were created to be and that is a wonderful thing
1,i took this supplement for months and i noticed a dramatic change in hair appearance length and my nails i would like to keep taking it but i can t afford it for a while which i am really bummed out about it i definitely recommend this product it also has a huge celebrity following and now i know why
0,if you re really looking forward to brightening your blonde go to the salon and ask for a non ammonia hair lightening or use an otc temporary product chamomile would have to be used every day for months to really make a change in your color the expense of this product is not justified by the results and while lush likes to toot its horn about being natural that designation could apply to arsenic it s pretty meaningless when combined with artificial preservatives on the top ten list for dangerous additives the parabens

1,when i hear the alarm go off and the opening strains of henry mancini s piano creep in i know i m preparing for that journey into the best alcohol induced haze of the on the crawford memorial interstate stops along the way include adoption wars birthday exploitation unfair life being let go rose rage raw rare steak one award taking that special exit for wire hanger etiquette christmas propaganda chadwick love and a snitch near death experience banishment making up soft drink wars loss new beginnings new losses last moments and last words before taking that final exit back to reality in a world filled with f me heels booze domestic disputes and the biggest taboo of them all wire hangers we all know she s a movie star she a bitch she dresses well and she s rich quoting john waters i ve watched this so many times that i need therapy
1,the easy sprouter is a great vertical sprouter the seeds or beans go into an inner cup with drainage holes the inner cup sets in the outer cup which catches any dripping water and still allows air circulation around the inner cup on all sides maintaining your growing sprouts for most seed types means holding the inner cup under running water for at least thirty seconds allowing excess water to drain off and setting the inner cup back in the outer cup doing this two or three times a day makes sure that the growing sprouts remain fresh enough to avoid spoiling moist enough not to dry out but never remaining in standing water most seeds need to be pre soaked initially and this step can be managed directly in the easy sprouter there are three lids two lock into place one with air holes one without the third is domed but doesn t actually lock onto the cup by comparison sprouting in canning jars requires the jar to be filled and emptied several times with each rinsing and draining sufficiently is not always easy the sprout master which is another sprouting tray i love allows similar rinsing but the seeds must be soaked in a different container and then transfered to the sprout master the sprout master allows the growing plants slightly more light because it has width rather than height but the difference is slight i ve mostly used my easy sprouter for leafy sprout salad mixes alfalfa clover etc these varieties take about a week to grow with the variety of lids the sprouter it is very flexible i haven t tried to sprout while traveling but i m confident that it would work well it works for storing your grown sprouts in the fridge as advertised but i usually take them out of the sprouter and break up the clumps before serving and put any left overs into a different container i use my easy sprouter nearly constantly along with my sprout master mini trays i currently have a second easy sprouter on order

0,cooking pleasures magazine is the magazine produced by the cooking club of america i very happily joined cooking club of america and began receiving this magazine quite a while ago the club offers so much to its subscribers but as time wore on i could see that the marketing department was a tad too aggressive for my taste the cooking club of america offers their potential members numerous items to entice them to join members can take part in member only contests where kitchen products and gift baskets are some of the prizes they can be sent food items or kitchen products to review they can also receive a cheese grater for joining there are some nice photographs in this publication the recipes are not complicated either although they do require some unusual ingredients and some that are very expensive that many people would find hard to locate i personally had to forego some recipes and others i had to order a couple of ingredients online because of the reasons given the cheese grater sent to you is a nice idea but being it is a rotary grater you have to squeeze very hard to get the cheese to grate also the grater is made of plastic and eventually snaps in half after using it only a handful of times the club also offers you a culinary resource directory the information contained in this directory is not difficult to find in a basic internet search you can also receive standard sized blank recipe cards unfortunately due to the size of recipe cards i do not believe anyone can even write the ingredients onto them without running out of space also part of the member benefits is to sample products for review potential members can see photographs of blenders ice cream makers and much more while a member there for three years i did have the opportunity to review quick rise yeast and a chipotle spice both were nice products they were not the glamorous photos of kitchen appliances but it was something currently they are offering a visa credit card with their logo with this card not only can you use the card like any other credit card but also you can receive club discounts if this is something that appeals to you see the club for details approximately months after you renew your own subscription they start mailing you about how you should renew your membership for the following year now so that you can help them keep club costs down after just paying for the current year i was not interested in paying for another year already an idea may be to not contact members so soon after they just paid their subscriptions that may save the club some money i have caller id and i utilize it all the time screening my calls to specifically avoid telemarketing calls imagine my surprise when i pick up a call and it was a representative for cooking club of america i was actually pleasantly surprised thinking i was about to embark on another benefit of being a member i was most disappointed to hear the mono toned voice on the other end of the line reading the script suggesting i become a lifetime member now when i tell them i am not interested they have a new deal for me when i still tell them i am not interested they have yet another deal the calls continued after this conversation for another couple of months at this point my subscription has expired i was relieved as the telemarketing phone call really turned me off you should have been there to see me receive my credit card statement cooking club of america automatically charged my credit card with my next subscription without my permission it was three months after my original subscription expired as you can imagine this was extremely upsetting upon doing my research for this article i have come to find that others have had similar experiences with this magazine it s a shame too as this magazine has plenty of potential unfortunately their marketing department could utilize different tactics in maintaining their current membership despite this magazine being very affordable i recommend that you save your money on this one and try fine cooking cuisine at home or cook s illustrated not only do these magazines provide better recipes more professional tips they also do not call you daily to get your money
0,i have followed bruce hornsby for over years and own every album he has ever come out with including two concert dvds i was reluctant to buy intersections due to owning all the other but if you have been to hornsby concert you know that he always keeos things fresh no exception here i loved the dvd of some of his performances there are treasures here imagine solo on the piano at an awards show the star spangled banner at the world series with marsalis and his performance with bb king it is a must for the hard core hornsby fan
0,i too like the old smucker s filled strawberry better aka fruit wheats this is ok but fruit filling is better they probably switched because it got to expensive to make unless they starting making in china thus you now have this nestle quick artificial strawberry tasting stuff
0,this seemed like the original johnny jump up i had for my first child years ago we loved that one so i got this one for my baby and after spending almost half an hour figuring out how to put it together it didn t work very well it just didn t seem as springy as it should be i ended up returning it and getting the version with the tray instead the jump go people have complained about the tray pinching baby s fingers against the doorway but we have a wide doorway so it works well and is a lot springier also our little guy likes the toy tray on the jump go version a lot

0,i ordered this cd based on the reviews first i have to say that i am not sure why it is called paris under a groove i was thinking that it would be in french at least the beats are nice i would not in any way compare it to buddha bar i just wasn t as thrilled as i thought that i would be it sounded very cheap no originality my fiancee is from paris and this was very disappointing not only to him but i was embarrassed as offering it as a present so far it sits on the shelf
0,not impressed at all with this product you are better off just to plug in your camera in the usb port and let windows process it at least you will get a chance to indicate where you want your pictures saved i suggest you don t use easyshare software windows pic and fax viewer is far superior to this software if you decide you will use it you will find that all your pics on the hard drive will be set to use easyshare the solution to this is to uninstall easyshare and all pics with revert to windows
0,god forbid i be so bold as to trash a classic and yes maybe because of all the raving reviews from my friends and from the book s great reputation i entered it with high expectations which the book however did not satisfy yes it is a good comedic parody of the upper class of the time a lampoon of the courtship ritual and of course oh so witty blah blah blah but it just wasn t my cup of tea the main character was likeable but that aside i found it completely insufferable to read through and absolutely painfully boring every subsequent event from the very beginning could be predicted let alone the ending not that anything really ever happens the entire book could be summed up with then they walked and talked and had tea and walked and talked and had tea walked and talked and had more tea then got married and lived happily ever after the entire novel was a headache of girly gossip and mental drama it would save more time just to watch a chick flick so if you re interested in the relationship fiascos of fictious characters witnessing the agony over who s going to marry who even though the reader could already predict the happily ever after match making light years in advance then this is the book for you if not then i suggest picking up some dan brown
0,motorola one is far better in quality as well to use

1,this bin is great for cloth diapers we love ours keeps odors to a minimum and holds a day or two s worth of diapers which is all i need because we wash every other day our local babies r us sells replacement deodisks or you can buy them online from cloth diaper vendors when the one that comes with it loses it s smell so that you can maintain freshness it s easy to clean and use and pretty inexpensive
1,i started using goat milk when my daughter was because she did not digest cow s milk that well this product is great has equal or more nutrition than cow s milk has a good flavor just slightly different than cow s milk is easy to digest and best of all the powder form is great if you are on the go i don t have to worry about it spoiling i just mix and give it to my daughter
0,i was purchasing rockin wheels the one with the train and fire truck for my son and the truck adventures came up as a combo deal with a discount if you bought them together we borrowed the rockin wheels dvd from the library and he liked it so much i thought it would be good to have two different ones however the truck adventures is not as good and my son doesn t even ask to watch it the songs are lame and so is the narrator don t bother
0,this pillow is an inflated u that fits around your neck one of the problems is it has a rather sharp plastic edge around where it touches your neck this can get pretty irritating the longer you use it fortunately it is dirt cheap so then i guess you get what you pay for
1,i had stopped using a regular hair dryer a few of months ago as i felt that my hair was becoming brittle and looking damaged however air drying my hair seemed to take forever it was then that i heard about the tourmaline professional ionic hair dryer from my hairdresser initially the price tag did put me off and i pushed the idea aside but somehow it remained somewhere in the corner of my mind and one fine day after getting late for a meeting yet again i decided to bite the bullet and buy the hairdryer and i tell you i have never been happier using a hair dryer my hair started looking better and less damaged in the first few weeks itself it has become smooth and silky and has a healthy glow though the weight and the time taken were almost similar to my old model the after effect is worth the price paid the product does come with a year warranty which is an added advantage to justify the exorbitant price though the sales brochures uses a lot of scientific terms like ionic mineral and blah blah i am not going to bother about it much as far as my hair appears healthy and saves me time so that i don t have to deal with being late for meetings i recommend this product to all who would love to have a mane to be proud of
1,my daughter was the most happy when she was in her halo i love these sleep blankets the cotton ones for use in florida weather were just perfect and then the colder months the toasty warm fleece i wish they would have come in a longer size since she outgrew them in height well before the weight limits i recommend them for anyone who wants a good night sleep your baby will always be just warm enough and not to warm in these fantastic sleepers
1,these folks continue to amaze me with their advancement of the state of the art in memory and amazon purchase and delivery is so dependable it s like money in the bank i hope no one comes in and tries to improve things
1,this is a really nice little bomb and smells of those little candy conversation hearts that come out for valentine s day each year sort of tangy and light and sweet but as with all that lush does there is a depth to this scent that makes it interesting enough to enjoy bathing in time and time again the tonka oil in it is good for helping you to forgive yourself and for relaxation according to the first lush times catalog it appeared in so whenever i am having a bad day or kicking myself for making a silly mistake i bathe in this and feel better it also has lavender for relaxation and neroli to uplift the spirits the only downside to this bomb is that the scent doesn t linger much at all once you get out of the bath which is disappointing to me since it smells so good still it is a worthy bath bomb and the cheery pink water and uplifting scent make it one i come back to time and time again
1,this concealer comes in a pencil form so it is very precise and offers very good coverage it stays on well it is more waxy and not as soft and creamy as most concealers so you can put it in a small precise spot and it will actually stay there i have tried many concealers for small blemishes and this is my favorite it comes in enough shades so you can find a good match which is important
1,this watch looks like business the movement is what i really like you get about ticks per second instead of so it looks more sweeping though i wouldn t call it sweeping i give it a based on looks and cost i haven t had it long and it took a couple days of wearing it for it to keep time correctly it was losing a few hours at night i guess it just needed to get charged up it s no rolex but it s no casio either

1,can t really add much to the reviews this is one of those albums that increases in listening value as it gets older i ll admit that when this came out in i only bumped the singles it didn t grab me at the time sometime around i gave it a spin and i ve been loving it ever since there are plenty of bangers on the album but classics like pour out a little liquor ballin how long will they mourn me cradle to the grave and under pressure make this album worth owning all by themselves the rest of the songs are on point too there isn t much filler on this album the production is handled by warren g nate dogg the awesone yet underrated easy mo b johnny j jay mopreme jay syke stretch and thug music i d say that all contributing producers turned in dope tracks the only tracks that i would call skip material are sh don t stop and don t get it twisted sh don t stop is probably the most lazily produced track on the whole album and the lyrics are unimpressive the production is on don t get it twisted cool but it s one of those songs that you have to be in the mood for it in my opinion volume is a passionate if at times misdirected release from the thug life camp the production is nothing short of vintage mid s cali vibes it holds up very well years after its release of course if you re a tupac completist you probably have this album already but even if you re not a pac fan this should be a part of your collection r i p tupac standout tracks how long will they mourn me feat nate dogg pour out a little liquor ballin my favorite cradle to the grave under pressure bury me a g feat natasha walker of y n v
1,i was also surprised by how tiny these magnets really are the good news they re super strong and so small that they re barely noticeable it looks our postcards are just magically affixed to the fridge they re elegant and clean the bad news they re pretty tough to pick up off the fridge if you don t have nails and even then it s easy to drop one good luck finding them when you do still an excellent product just as advertised just be sure that you really consider how small an of an inch really is before you buy
0,i installed this in my new garmin nuvi gps prior to making a trip to iowa city iowa thought that it would provide some information useful about the city and the surrounding area found that there is not a single location in the memory that covers anywhere in iowa this is advertised as a north american travel guide did they move iowa
1,expect a liberal dose of everything you generally do from a martial arts flick slapstick comedy overly melodramatic subplotting and on occasion even a hint of a story all that aside which is how i am sure the director saw it the balletic intricate and often incredible stunt work during the action scenes is an absolute treat jet li s utter disregard for human limits is evident as he turns in a surprisingly measured yet kinetic performance nothing like his forgettable hollywood yawns the subtitles for this mandarin language effort are a bit difficult to read since the english is in small print below the more prominent chinese subtitles but when the action kicks into gear forget them and just watch the graceful choreography of the fight scenes notably notable in the three installments part i a mind blowing hook and ladder battle plus a terrific umbrella sequence part ii the climactic fight with donnie yen the speed and technique shown during the double pole fight is staggering yen s moves with his cloth staff left me gob smacked part iii this one clearly suffers and is even borderline skippable the final fight scene at the lion dance competition is a colorful pageant but lacks the impact of the one on one fights in the first two films mainly because the participants are all wearing giant lion head masks all in all can t go wong with this purchase
1,i was a music director at a college radio station when this came out and along with a ton of other albums this one commanded my attention shoegazers i am sure all the label slinging yahoos are still wiping the egg off their faces its as if the band heard they were pigeonholed and gave them all the big finger just buy it and all the rest
0,this is a very cheaply built product we had a hard time getting it to mist at all even though the instruction say fill it with water at least inch above the misting device it took trial and error to find the exact right level that it would mist at when it did mist it would not get more than about inch from the top so the mist never made it out of the bowl we did like the changing color lights
1,good price just not sure it is needed
0,the photo shows four containers each the product is actually only one container very misleading possibly intentionally so also shipping costs for a product give me a break on top of it all the chocolate is nothing special you can get containers of ghiradelli drinking chocolate in specialty shops for which tastes better
1,when i got a new computer at the end of the edition was installed on my computer by gateway although i never used streets and trips and barely used encarta i used word and picture it quite heavily well my hard drive died a few weeks ago and i had to get a new computer i bought microsoft works suite to go with it i was a bit apprehensive because picture it was replaced with microsoft digital image standard editor it took me a while to get fluent in picture it and the idea of learning a new photo system was daunting i write mostly for the web and use pictures to accompany my reviews and articles as well as for ebooks i haven t done any extensive work with it yet but it appears easy to use if you have experience with picture it if you ve never used any image program before it may be a bit confusing i feel that picture it was more self explanatory however for all that the works suite gives you i feel it s a good buy word has advantages over the older version for example you can easily insert images and encarta may be helpful for kids doing homework or curious adults wanting to learn more about something updating encarta is easy as clicking a mouse just open up the program and click update encarta new articles and updates will automatically be added to your computer although i still don t use streets and trips i go to mapquest reflexively i still think this is a great suite for a great price

0,this is a sad invention instead of massaging it vibrates and in no way relieves stress besides this it s very low budget first off the label for a thigh massage actually vibrates at you calves on the ottoman where it is labeled lumbar it actually massages your thighs when you try the pre designed massages modes the chair vibrates very quickly at seemingly random spots the whole thing is almost musical whoever designed this chair should try a different profession besides all this the chair itself is fairly comfortable and the heat is nice although a little weak

1,nfsu does capture the idea of building and racing cars but i think they could go a little further into the design of your so called pimp mobile the only interior you get to design is the trunk i think they could at least do the seats or the wheel outside design is a ok anything from sideskirts to multi colored vinyels you make your car fierce the plot line in single player mode really dosen t go that deep your just some guy who wants to get his title back in multi player you race your own cars in tracks you already won but the down side is the whole graphics in two player is horrible it is a game worth getting but you might sell it later on

0,i purchased this for myself and my year old to play with the screen is way too dark to be able to use at dusk or after but if in direct sunlight you can t see it either it s pretty small buttons and screen and a little confusing if you are a person who is using hard earned money to purchase this then don t but if you just want to check it out and be okay with not wanting it later or losing the money you spent go for it
0,shekhar kapur s vision of a e w mason s the four feathers is well done visually but unfortunately much of the original story is lost to create a more fast paced and action packed plot while the basic story is kept many small details seem to have been needlessly changed for those who don t know the four feathers is supposedly about harry feversham a man enlisted in the army when harry is informed he will be sent to war in the sudan he hides this information and quietly resigns from the army to be with his fiancé ethne however life with ethne is soon changed when he receives three white feathers from his army colleagues explaining to ethne what he has done and that the feathers are a symbol of cowardice do not help harry in fact she tears a feather out of her fan to make four feathers harry then sets out to regain the lost respect of his friends through helping them in an ultimate goal to regain the respect of ethne for the most part only minor details are changed from the novel to the movie for example the way that harry s friend jack durrance goes blind or the fact that harry disguised himself as a greek not as an arab the change that seems most prominent however is the fact that in the film jack durrance knows of harry s resignation from the beginning this subverts the whole quest that jack undertakes to find out the truth in the novel in addition the entire battle between the warden of the house of stone of omdurman and harry and abou fatma was created solely for action value in the film however despite this addition of action the movie still seems to drag at points films are almost never completely accurate when following a novel that is why they are only based on them however as i ve said a lot of the changes made seem senseless i would recommend this film to someone who has not read the book or who does not mind liberal film interpretations of novels if they have an hour or two to waste those looking for a movie to keep them on the edge of their seats would be advised to find something else
1,i bought this for my new sony ericson phone so that i could actually put some music on the phone it came with a ms pro adapter which is nice because i have a slot on my computer for that it is fast and just what i wanted
1,i have seen products similar to this for substanially more money when this one arrived it could easily rival one of the more expensive models the plastic top detracts a bit from the overall look but serves its purpse well the remainder is beautifully constructed the drawers are lined in black fabric like a jewelry box it looks like it cost much more than it did i thought i would tuck this away in a corner of my office but it is so attractive i will probably have it front and center

0,john updike s literary criticism is perceptive and sparely written every one of his non fiction collections is worth reading but his novels have from the very first been precious over written and stifling in their desperate need for approbation when he writes fiction he s like a dog doing tricks for reward and certainly the rewards have come but for readers outside the us at least it s all a little mystifying john cheever was a far better writer yet his work seems somehow to be regarded by americans as the lesser canon time will correct this mistake no doubt but in the meantime updike pours out ever more cloying and over heated work like this if i still have your attention let me recommend the collected stories of john cheever updike could only dream of writing prose like that
1,this pump works great for occasional use and after months i still have not encountered any problems with the suction that some reviewers have mentioned the instruction book explains how to clean the motor in the event of suction loss so hopefully that problem is avoidable however beware that the motor is very loud i definitely wouldn t recommend taking this one to work or anywhere else that you would need to be discreet when i use it i sit in the bathroom with the fan on so that my family doesn t have to hear it i also recommend buying the micro steam bags by medela so you can just throw the parts in the microwave and clean them right away each time you use them

1,canon makes a great underwater housing for a reasonable price i purchased this for a recent trip to grand cayman and cozumel i didn t go scuba diving on this trip but i did take the camera snorkeling diving to depths it worked flawlessly and i got some pictures i was very happy with one thing i did not anticipate was the use the camera got out of the water going from ac to the hot humid outdoors my eos rebel fogged up condensation and even after minutes i couldn t take good pictures with the in the uw housing i just wipped the housing s glass portal with a lens tissue after it had warmed up a couple of minutes and i was able to take clear pictures the instructions are pretty good but it took me a while to figure out how to take out the o ring seal for cleaning lubing once i figured it out it wasn t so hard the may be getting a little old but it still takes decent pictures and even with the housing i don t have so much money tied up in the system that i would be devestated if it was lost or stolen i will probably upgrade to the or they both use the same batteries as the with the wp or wp housing at some time in the near future but i will definitely keep the and wp as backups

0,i purchased this product in hopes of a wonderful nights sleep well folks this is not what happened at all i turned on my conair and snuggled under the covers after a very stressful day about minutes into my relaxation i almost received heart failure due its soothing sounds of a train wreck the volume which seemed to have been controlled by satan reached top volume although i never had touched it myself i tried to turn it down and the volume still was blaring i unplugged and plugged it back in numerous times and still it would not work

0,the monitor is ok but sometimes is staticky and other times just needs a new channel and the problem with that is that the button that changes the channel is in the baby s room not on the parent unit also we like to have a second child unit elsewhere in our house and if both are on at the same time it seems to cause additional static broken signal only to be reset by changing the channel and no signal overall i am very disappointed it got tremendous reviews and i expected a better product than the first years model i had previouly and i am goig back to my old one

0,a selfish stupid woman engages in white collar crime and goes to prison for her misdeed i say stupid because she could have paid a modest fine and gotten away with her crime but chose instead to gamble with her and her family s future by trusting her lot to a jury of her peers they judged her as harshly as i did once in prison she is exposed to life s realities possibly for the first time in her wretched existence seeing various and sundry sordid occurences beyond her middle class ken she decides to meddle in the affairs of others possibly motivated by petty jealousy since she isn t getting any drugs or sex from the handsome male prison guards to make a long story short her rabble rousing is eventually heard in washingtonm d c a senator takes more than a passing interest in her and her sentence is commuted to a home curfew i guess the moral of the story is white collar criminals are better suited to country club prisons if you have nothing whatsoever to do your dvd player is broken and you don t feel like cleaning the oven this movie might possibly entertain otherwise avoid at all costs
0,this movie was cheeseball beginning to end i thought the concept was corny even before i watched it but decided to give it a try anyway big mistake a robot who can love lame and with all this high tech stuff the docs can t bring the couple s real son out of a coma or whatever was wrong with him so the parents forget all about him and get some robot kid who can love but lacks the common sense of a human making him a danger to himself and everyone brialliant plan especially considering the amount of orphan human kids there must be in this messed up futuristic world then the real son wakes up and comes home and thats when the problems with the robot kid begin the family decides they don t want the robot and the mom loves him so much she dumps him somewhere instead of sending him back to the lab to be humanely disposed of it was then i knew i was smelling a stinker but nooooo someone else wanted to watch it till the end until he soon found out the horrible truth i have since nicknamed it artificial idiocy the worst part was the end ugh i don t even want to get into it but those of you who see the title of my review above and have seen the movie know what i mean the whole plot was muddled and full of holes with no sense of realism for those of you who have not seen it i suggest renting it before you buy it maybe this movie is great for some people it just wasn t my thing

1,i don t understand why testing for each language exercise is not the default selection instead of having to select it it is frustrating to go through an entire exercise hoping to see how well you did and realize that you forgot to select test at the beginning also it seems that testing should be available for the guided exercise also not just the regular exercises other than these two things the program is very good
1,my husband and i travel a lot and someone told us about this on one of our last cruises we actually watched people playing it as well so my husband actually remembered the name of this game and got this for me for a christmas gift surprised me we plan on taking it with us on all our trips we will be able to use it on cruises on planes wherever we may have to play the waiting game we know its good for people on up it seemed like a fun game

1,simply clearly written the book is a very practical guide for someone new to but serious about farming concise yet still comprehensive and fun to read would have liked a section on draft animals but schwenke s disclaimer for not including it makes sense
0,as the opening cutscene introduces you to blinx the cat the supporting cast and the particulars of his upcoming adventures i found myself trying to wrap my brain around the basic premise of the story the idea is that a secret off world clan of humanoid cat creatures armed with souped up vacuum cleaners are responsible for the development and dispersal of time itself to every known plane of existence on the map it seems that time when compressed tightly enough to be transported by said cats takes the form of one of five different brightly colored shapes if these crystals are left out on the open for too long without being properly introduced to the flow of things they turn into monsters i could go on because the game certainly doesn t stop there but i think you get the point i like to think that there s a fairly thick line drawn between cartoony fantasy and super detailed realism generally a lot of the physics and environmental details are taken for granted in a realistic game because they re almost exclusively set in a photorealistic lifelike location cartoons on the other hand generally don t worry themselves with the particulars and are primarily concerned with delivering a good time how much fun would the wile e coyote cartoons be if every time the lead character suffered a grisly fate it strictly obeyed the laws of gravity and aerodynamics blinx tries to straddle that thick line by delivering a story that s overly detail centric in an environment that s right out of a kid s show the result is a tale that comes off as way way out of left field and almost completely abstract it focuses on things that would be better left to the viewer s imagination and ignores the importance of a good underlying story along the way beneath the needless discussions of why there are monsters in the world how time compression works and how cats are actually responsible for all that we hold dear the actual plot is almost laughably straightforward and generic there s a princess evil pigs have kidnapped her and it s up to you and you only to rescue her and save her world that s it no side stories no reasoning no subplots just a straightforward rush from point a to point b and here i thought the phrase save the princess was universally recognized as an ages old cliche now i don t want it to sound like i m railing on this game just because it s got a few more nitpicky details than its peers and it reuses an old phrase from way back in the platformer handbook as its sole driving factor it s also completely lacking in character development general storytelling and ongoing inspiration none of the characters in blinx really establish themselves as individuals including the lead character himself you don t hate the pig on the spaceship because he s trying to destroy the world you hate him because every time he shows up he tries to steal your money i honestly forgot there was a princess at the end of the game after level three because she s never mentioned between the game s start and its finish i mean the very first super mario brothers at least reminded you that the princess was in another castle at the end of every boss fight i don t honestly think the game was really designed to be enjoyable so much as it was geared to be overly challenging the first level and a half are set up in the standard get to know you format with the simplest of enemies the most routine of stage layouts and plenty of opportunities to mess around with your tools shortly thereafter you re thrown to the wolves for the most part the level designs are very short with more of an emphasis on cheap hits than on complexity and true challenge i noticed a lot of overlap in the stage layouts whether it s retracing your steps time and time again or walking along a catwalk har har above the beginning of the stage and invariably plummeting back to the start point you ll almost always know what needs to be done but actually accomplishing that act is the real trick i just can t overemphasize how unbearably cheap most of this game really is if there s a bottomless pit nearby and chances are very good that there is blinx will find a way to force himself into it regardless of what you re hitting on the control pad if there s an enemy two feet in front of you and you hit the attack button he ll aim at a random switch on the other side of the room rather than the imminent threat that s not to say that the entirety of the time sweeper is totally without merit because it does bring a few fresh ideas to the table but for the most part those insights are hampered by their surroundings the ability to control time for instance was at the time a really fresh interesting new play mechanic and still stands out today despite the limited field of imitators that have since emerged you can rewind a few seconds to catch an enemy unaware or rebuild a crumbling bridge pause the action and take advantage of the frozen time knock the level into slow motion etc all the while blinx is moving around in real time it s a great idea but the implementation is painfully short and underutilized why can t i use two controls at the same time why don t more aspects of the stage encourage the player to experiment with and solve problems with these powers why doesn t the ridiculous ten minute stage time limit pause speed up or rewind when i use my time powers why is their duration so brief and why can t i hold more than a dozen uses at a time i mean this could ve really been a fantastic experience if the time control aspect had been beefed up a little further and treated as more than just an auxiliary function of an otherwise run of the mill platformer the controls too are an undeveloped undertested nightmare blinx himself is often sluggish to respond especially when implementing his time controls he has difficulty making a precise turn whether on midair or on solid ground he stops to briefly celebrate when gaining an item which leaves him open to constant enemy attacks he routinely moves in the direction of certain death as though pulled by a magnetic field whether you ve instructed him to do so or not he ll occasionally refuse to perform a double jump particularly when attempting a difficult precise leap across a gaping chasm i think it s these controls that most make blinx so mind squashingly aggravating at a glance you d imagine they d be fairly difficult to screw up you ve got a jump button a suction fire button a time control button and an analog stick to control movement plus there had already been a long established line of three dimensional platformers on the market in the years before the title s release paving the way to an ideal control experience super mario had its issues sure but nothing like this and it was the trailblazer for the entire genre s jump to the world of it s like they had a map leading them right to the treasure and decided to forge their own path anyway i can t even say i m impressed by the graphics showcased throughout the time sweeper either with the exception of the lead character himsef these are some incredibly cheesy preschoolish character designs they feel unfinished and hurried less purposeful than you d imagine especially in contrast with blinx himself particularly insulting is the large population of simple blobs that roam around the levels trying in vain to bump into you and cause a fatal injury here s a finely detailed main character with such close attention paid to his wardrobe that even the gloss of his shoes was obviously debated time and time again and he s pitted against a set of monsters that could ve sprung to life directly out of the pages of a four year old s sketchbook despite featuring a spoken dialog track there s no english voice acting i couldn t pinpoint the language but my wife seems to think it s either french or some close variation of it it certainly didn t sound japanese while this does add a touch of personality to the title and it s not every day that you get a chance to hear a cat shouting something in the language of love it all seemed really odd and out of place coming out of my television everyone s vocal personalities are so black and white too that i feel like a great chance to establish some much needed individuality amongst the cast was lost once again here the bad guys all have the same deep gravelly transparently evil tone while the good guys are all bright cheery squeaky and high pitched like the monkeys in super monkey ball it s like a parody of the games that had come before but i won t give the developers enough credit to assume that they were doing it on purpose overall blinx is really just a few promising concepts thrown together in one package strapped to the shell of a far below average third person platformer and unleashed upon an unsuspecting public at the time of its release it was still in need of a lot of polishing some serious scrutiny behind closed doors and a re evaluation of just how far some of these concepts and half hearted character designs could be conceivably stretched without losing any quality on top of that i really don t know which audience they were targeting with it the game is ridiculously difficult which betrays the childlike demeanor that surrounds it and leads me to believe it was meant for the serious gamers out there but so bright kid friendly and annoyingly cutesy that i can t imagine anyone in that demographic rushing out to the stores on release day the number of spontaneous controller hurls shot through the roof during my time with blinx reaching near marvel vs capcom levels with its unashamed excruciatingly cheap hits especially in later levels i have no idea how i acquired the willpower to finish level eight the game is adequately lengthy and offers some replay value with hidden cat medals in each stage eventually unlocking production sketches promotional materials and the like once you start hunting for floating cat heads in those super tough later levels though you ll remember why you were so happy to be finished with them in the first place unless you feel like pulling your hair out in clumps i shaved my head after the experience as a part of the cleansing process and enjoy self mutilation i d recommend you stay far away

0,i am extremelly disappointed with roxio the makers of cd creators especailly easy cd creator i purchased easy cd creator sometime back from an affiliate of amazon com it was dispatched promptly and in very good condition i installed it on my computer running windows after some initial problmes it was running fine a few days back i installed windows xp professional on my computer and i got a message that the cd creator was not compatible with this version of windows it hinted to contact roxio i tried contact roxio with the help of the link but found it impossible to send them my message they have an automated roxann that is so difficult to understand next they invite you to a webticket and you are supposed to mention your problem on it but when you submit your query or complain nothing happens the site just stares at you dumbly there is no way to obtain roxio s mailing address either so now i am stuck with this easy cd creator with no help from roxio
0,horror movies are a dime a dozen now and nothing really speical about them anymore sad to say considering its probably my faviorte genere this movie was a disappointment from the start whoever did editing on this movie needs to be fired i mean they are standing there talking and it just cuts away when you think something is going to happen i didnt watch the whole movie it sucked that bad i bought this movie used and i d gladly give it back to the owner free of charge

0,i have owned the bed and it is very dangerous for a child i am stunned that this product is still on the market while it is very cute and fairly priced you hardly get what you pay for my daughter loved the look of this her first big girl bed that was until it fell to pieces with her in it the metal rails that are to hold the bed together and the matress in place are not properly planned out if you can even manage to get this bed built which is difficult much more so than it seems at first the metal support bars fall out when the child gets into the bed it is flimsy poorly designed dissapointing and dangerous delta should be ashamed

1,i just wrote a review for opm and had forgotten about this magazine i also used to subscribe and had recently let my subscription run out i will not say it is not because i do not like this magazine but because i am trying to save some money but the fact is that this is probably the best multiplatform gaming magazine on the market the reviews are smart and fresh never hackneyed or cliched the way a lot of other magazines are and some of my reviews sorry guys but the introductory article in each and every magazine by the chief editor always sounds like it has been written by a harvard grad with a layman s ability to make everything easy to understand he has a way of making every article within the magazine all come together never biased they are not afraid of telling it like it is in their reviews i would highly recommend subscribing to this magazine and like somebody else mentioned better to go directly to the store and get the discount card after in used game purchases it pays for itself highly recommend mc white said if you re a gamer than you gotta have this magazine edit believe it or not when i got home yesterday just after writing this review i had a copy of the september issue in my mailbox i had forgotten i had called customer service about a missed issue they were nice enough to extend me a two issue subscription free of charge to cover my missed issue i was quite impressed and tickled pink when i got my newest copy in the mail when i arrived at my posh homestead thank you game informer for continued excellent service and a wonderful magazine

0,i just purchased the top end dell dimension xps with the rpm harddrive but i still have to allow about seconds for the initial program startup then it seems to hang for to seconds after that i usually just go get a cup of coffee when i start act and when i come back we are ready to roll i also reboot my system every time i close act the system just seems to run better without any lingering remnants of the program in memory whenever i delete a contact the program locks up it has done this through several versions i simply reboot restart act and it works fine at some point act changed the date on many hundreds of my activities to now i manually type the date into the call to do meeting and note fields to avoid this problem in the future i have been an act customer since the early dos days i have a huge commitment to the program in that much of my important data is now stored here and some of it is nowhere else it is so difficult to export all the data including notes history etc that i am basically trapped my point is a program like this is not one that you can easily bail out of like word or excel which has some alternatives available which will read your current files a lot of the act database is proprietary and while you can purchase a conversion program from a few vendors it is not a cheap proposition to do so
1,the azden transmitter receiver system has operated marvelously well for me over scores of interviews as an aspiring video maker it was a product i should have bought a long time ago mine is the powered model not the aa but it has proven well made light and easy to use there s something neat about micing people with a lavaliere unit i find that they enjoy the attention of attaching the mic and the professional touch that it brings to the taping being able to range abut the room while taping and simultaneously retaining good audio is a remarkable experience another benefit of micing someone is that cuts way back on ambient noise the din of voices surrounding your interview is a typical intrusion using the lavaliere cuts out a great deal of the unwanted sonic information

1,the hand of fear is not top notch all time classic who even producer philip hinchcliffe doesn t like it very much the only reason it was likely selected for dvd release over such classics as the seeds of doom or terror of the autons is probably because it s sarah jane s farewell story many stories during the hinchcliffe holmes years of who sometimes referred to as the golden age of doctor who sometimes referred as the gothic horror period were based on movies the seeds of doom was based on the day of the triffids horror of fang rock was based on and then there were none if not based on an actual film many were inspired in general by the look and feel of the hammer horror films the hand of fear was inspired by the hands of dr orlac the old horror film about the disembodied hand of a killer the story starts out great beginning with a fantastic in joke rock quarries were very frequently used in the program as they were easily accessible and somewhat looked like alien planets here the doctor and sarah land in a rock quarry on earth and sarah thinks they re on an alien planet after an accident with a detonation sarah finds eldrad s hand and starts saying she he it must live a lot eldrad must live high note on must she takes the hand to a nuclear power plant where it can start absorbing energy and regenerating the story thus far is excellent and sarah jane possessed by eldrad is genuinely creepy though why she s dressed as andy pandy i ll never know extremely effective is the scene were the power plant worker disappears with the hand into the core also extremely effective is eldrad eerily searing through the metal door of the power plant s core and then slowly emerging the show goes downhill quick once eldrad doctor and co head to eldrad s planet producer hinchcliffe said this was a bad shift and that it lacked a certain punch i agree for some reason once eldrad is back on its home planet the story loses all its edge furthermore sarah s farewell seems entirely forced the hand of fear overall is still good stuff though and is well worth owning it is one of the few episodes that contains the cool version of the tardis interior why they didn t stick with the awesome jules verne ish interior i have no idea
0,i was looking forward to the speck rubberized cover with some excitement however i was disappointed while the cover fits very well it and may work in an industrial environment after the first day it looks like it s two years old if you have an sd card in your treo forget it the belt clip will pop your card daily and the belt clip itself is an afterthought easily sliding off your belt don t even think about putting the treo in your pocket as the non slip cover won t begin to slide into your pocket finally the price at is outrageous for a cover if you re in an industrial enviroment this may be your cover but for the rest of us keep shopping or buy insurance
1,i love this magazine mainly because i am a figure and fitness competitor it has great tips if you are not competitor and just love to workout this magazine is for you too you will get motivated by every article and meal plans i do not recommend magazine for individuals who are just looking to get toned and not to cut body fat to supreme low levels oxygen can at times overly advertise the supplements i used to get shape mag but i did not like the models in that mag they looked way too small to be advertising fitness i highly recommend this mag for those individuals are intersted in competitions

1,i have two penguin humidifiers which i purchased a couple of months ago for the money i think these are great and simple to use i did not have any problems with leakage the key is to make sure that the top is on securely also some minor dripping is to be expected when you take the penguin body off the base just carry a washcloth with you no problem super quiet i think it is just the right size for a bedroom easy to clean and fill i had tried others honeywell and vicks and this is by far my favorite
0,my second review as my first did not get printed as usual anyway i ll try to make this short and sweet i usually try and give credits to directors producers writers and actors in most of my movie reviews however i m going to make an exception here i ve read other reviews that have called this gigantic turd hilarious night of the living dead money color wonderful for gorehounds etc etc etc all i can say is it must not take much to please you people this is without a doubt the worst excuse for a movie i ve ever seen my most humble apologies to tobe hooper and mortuary the whiners of horror movies are always moaning and groaning why don t critics take horror movies more seriously well einstein here s a glowing example this is nothing but grade d trash horrible effects horrible acting horrible writing horrible directing you name it it s not in there this movie s most feeble attempts at humor come off as just that feeble i bought this together with dead and breakfast and i can t begin to tell you which one is worse so here s a little advice from me go check out a book at the library buy a book go to a real movie have your hair done have a manicure do anything but waste your time on this gag fest for all the wrong reasons of a movie another one that i would give zero stars to if i could
0,i bought one outside amazon and charged it hours my mini maglite had more power the battery never worked don t waste your money better pay a little more but for something that works
0,these hair topia pills are nothing but garbage pure nonsense trust me i know this because i used to buy them i first bought these pills last year in june after hair formula s unsuccessful promise of producing longer and stronger hair in the four months of usage well these pills were not as expensive as the previous brand mentioned and had promised also change dry and brittle hair into long and healthy and it did absolute nothing i said to myself like hair formula that maybe i just need to give this more time so i bought a month supply and gave it months in all and there was no difference at all this product might just work for others which it has but it certainly didn t work for me i must admit that i brought this on myself as my mother warned me not to buy these ridiculously expensive pill since they do nothing for hair that grows naturally anyway and that if you really want to get hair pills then just buy them a whole lot cheaper in regular stores like giant or even hair vitamins in the damn dollar store thus i am here to warn others not to waste their precious money and if you are going to please don t do it on this site you can buy this product a little cheaper at hairboutique com

1,i m not a big perfume girl i mean i love the pretty bottles and tend to store up the really antique or antique y looking ones but i generally prefer essential oils over perfume that said out of the dozens that i own i keep three on hand at all times four if you count the little mini i got from spacenk santa maria novella for rubbing on my ankles i know it s a bit mature but it reminds me of italy and monks chanel mademoiselle because my mother always taught me to love chanel and i just prefer that scent to the others and marc jacobs because to be honest if i had to choose the loveliest this would be it it s lovely and light not too over powering affordable and gets tons of compliments also comes in cute bottle

0,i bought this for my lower back i am pregnant now and my back keeps getting achy and goes out from time to time it is great because it actually wraps all the way around to the back of my hips giving my entire lower back the heat without having to switch it from one side to the other however the inner pad bunches up tremendously i have used it for a few weeks now and have to take the cover off to open the pad back up by stretching it out again it hasn t gone back to the original shape if i had known it would do this i would have never purchased it

1,a ridiculously good album this is as good an introduction to jawbox as you re going to find it s got most of their really great songs plus some live songs which are great another good thing is that desoto records the label that was started by the band has re released the cd so it shouldn t be as hard to find

1,the bushnell perma focus wide angle binoculars were the ideal choice for my recent trip to tanzania and the serengeti they worked perfectly for the application needed a really happy surprise on just how well these worked as we bounced around on dirt roads and cross country in land rovers the perma focus feature was outstanding and made things simple and easy the magnification level was perfect for almost every scenario we came across anything that was outside of about feet came through in crystal clear vivid color and clarity it really made for up close and personal viewing of all the animals we saw by far these were the best investment i made before the trip i can t imagine being without them now on such an expedition really fantastic performance and a great value to boot the vendor was fast flawless in the transaction too in my opinion you won t be disappointed with these binoculars troy
0,i was recommended this movie by a friend here at college and because he spoke so highly of it i thought i would just buy it instead of rent it i definitely regret that decision if you re thinking of buying it rent it first it was dull and obnoxious not to mention weird the only entertaining part of watching this film was making fun of it with my roommate which is why i gave it star instead of however if you re still interested definitely rent it you might enjoy it

1,i like that everything fits in the case my year old enjoys dumping all the pieces on the floor no big deal you can also store a few parts in the potato and take it with you very happy with purchase
0,i purchased this album because i am a fan of the last poets upon listening to the samples provided by amazon com i thought i was getting an album that would contain very similar content to the last poets some great politically charged poetry perhaps accompanied by some funky beats however when i listened to the whole cd i was disappointed to find out that the vast majority of the tracks sound the most like get out of the ghetto blues if more of the tracks had the sound of the title track this would be a five star album in my opinion true scott heron has a lot of great social commentary throughout the album but not in the form i had hoped for i would take the last poets album this is madness over this particular scott heron album
1,this product is not the best ever created as the roxxi doll that comes with it is not the prettiest of bratz dolls she has huge black and red streaks in her hair as well as an oddly shaped head however one gets used to her and can even find her pretty the stage itself is a great product but plugging it in to your stereo is more confusing than you might think this playset comes with a microphone that is different from the regular rock angelz microphone as it is gray and of a different style also included is a faux snakeskin chair roxxi a guitar and a few accessories like bottled water and make up compacts the stage itself is rather nice and i strongly suggest the instrumentz if you buy this however be warned that it is not the best of bratz products despite its appeal it s rather nice though
1,the funny thing about this movie is that i read negative reviews here and rather agree with what they assert that the plots and some of the characters are not very evolved due to time if you disect the movie yes this is true nonetheless i love this movie i love watching the what the actors do with this material and how they manage with so little time to invest the viewer in their story emma thompson gives a perfect performance i think highlighting how complicated long marriages can become and the pitfalls of being too functional bill nighy is hilarious acting as the needed jolts in between serious moments quite refreshing most of all it is genuinely funny life can feel or at least my life can feel disjointed and i love a movie where a larger pattern emerges from seemingly chaotic events and connections
1,this stuff is great a fresh alternative to the regular suspects highly recommended to those who like a bit of a kick in their palate
1,cast denzel washington john goodman donald sutherland embeth davidtz james gandolfini elias koteas gabriel casseus michael j pagan running time minutes rated r for violence and language fallen starts with convicted serial killer edgar reese elias koteas being executed in the gas chamber as the man who brought him to justice detective jon hobbes denzel washington looks on hobbes thinks that this is the end but soon has to rethink as he receives a phone call which tells him to check a house out where he finds a dead man named muscovich glen witko in a bathtub having been poisoned the same way reese used to kill his victims at first hobbes fears a copy cat killer but during the course of his investigation the name robert milano comes up a decorated cop who apparently committed suicide hobbes speaks with his daughter gretta embeth davidtz who at first is reluctant to speak with him things become even stranger when the man who killed muscovich charles robert joy is found dead in exactly the same way having been poisoned again eventually gretta tells hobbes the truth he is in fact dealing with an ancient demon called azazel who has the power to jump form body to body at will by mere psychical touch the demon azazel seems to be taunting hobbes ruining his life career setting him up for murder getting to his friends family hobbes must find a way to destroy the ancient demon before it destroys him everyone he cares about charismatic leading man denzel washington is suitably cast as the protagonist and proves to have range while john goodman is okay but greatly underused while the same applies to james gandalfini who plays almost the exact same character donald sutherland doesn t prove to have any range doing the usual gruff routine that he does in nearly all of his movies embeth davidtz is a talented and totally under rated actress she delivers a good performance and shows great potential for the future the directing and camera work in this movie was superb it was done in such a way where you can see azazel s spirit go from person to person simply by following the camera up and down the crowd and watching the subtle touches one makes in a normal walk about town although this film does require your full attention it does not go unrewarded and you are not left at the end scratching your head wondering what had happened for the past two hours fallen is an intelligently written supremely efficiently executed and one of the most unheralded unnoticed thrillers of the late part of the decade one of the better of its kind
0,not the manufacturer s fault i blame u s congress for this the clock has an internal chip which did not recognize the earlier dst change this year there was going to be such a long delay before being able to get a replacement chip and or clock that we just returned the clocks disappointed
0,a great magazine i had a subscription for years that ended about months ago i paid for the year subscription back then but suddenly the price in the us has skyrocketed astronomically i can go to any music store or a borders barnes and noble and buy each individual magazine for anywhere from issue to issue typically and i have never seen it more than issue however suddenly the subscription they have is like an issue which is outrageous it s not amazon s doing either i was a subscriber for years and this same thing happened to me they asked me to come back at a lower rate something like year which is still an issue sure that s might be a bit cheaper about cents an issue on the average price above than buying each one in the store but i doubt anyone would want every single issue individually especially at tthat price the upside is that uncut is far and away the best music movie magazine in the world i d say about of the issues i would have bought in the store when i was a subscriber but until they begin printing the magazine in the states it s just not worth a subscription the writing of the magazine is superb brilliant and varied writing throughout each magazine is about as big as a small book too and of them i d read a good of the magazine too even finding myself reading some articles about artists i could care less about because the articles were so well written but the price is way too high to subscribe it s a shame too rolling stone is nowhere close to being as good as uncut and although mojo and q are strong they can t hold the candle to it either the only blemish on the magazine itself for all you who might want to buy a single issue is that the covers tend to repeat every months and i mean how much beatles can i read and i m in the upper of beatle freaks out there still the magazine is well worth it the subscription price is too incredibly high though to recommend in any circumstances i would think this would be a great market to move into in the us if i was in that position i don t think rolling stone could compete anymore if it would make things cheaper i would do away with the free cd bonus too aside from a few listens and the novelty of it all the free cd was a good incentive to make me interested a few years back the cd s get old quick and after a while i would toss them out after a quick preview summary wait until if the price drops but don t subscribe it s too expensive and much cheaper to buy each magazine individually the magazine itself though is stars and almost always great
0,am i the only person that felt this book was twisted disjointed and something was just not working the beginning was great but the second half left a lot to be desired this could have been a great story the author veered off track or something

1,to be honest i can t think of a word that can explain the emotional link with this album apart from it being the most beautiful sound i ve heard for me listening to this album makes me feel emotionally confused but absolutely complete at the same time never before has an album stopped me in my tracks as firmly as this one my favourite songs on the album are the only moment we were alone and six days at the bottom of the ocean every time my ears are blessed with these artworks i m am fixated on nothing else but them i literally cannot communicate with anyone or anything i just have to listen to them intently this album is not as experimental as those who tell the truth shall die those who tell the truth shall live forever but i feel it is just as good and the songs are put together impeccably well with no song being neither longer nor shorter than it has to be i love the pure clean sound of this album and see it as light as the wind the trance that this album provides is indescribable i m not saying if you buy this album it will have this exact effect on you this description is merely from a personal note either way i strongly recommend this band and album to anybody who is looking for a purchase for you can have no doubt that this album is extremely well produced written recorded thought out and sounding buy it you will not regret your choice one bit

1,i am amazed my mom sent this to me after i d complained about already being eaten alive by mosquitos this year i don t just get bites i get huge oddly shaped so itchy they re almost painful welts and i am that person who attracts every single biting insect i have often wished that i sweated deet however i don t i tried this dubiously first in the morning i d been getting bites every day between and even with high deet no bites i still didn t believe it i used it again that evening after a rainstorm had come through from about to no bites it comes with a belt clip but i left it outside at one point when i came inside the second i left its side a mosquito landed on me i have since then used it several more times no insect spray at all and it s been very muggy around here absolutely no bites i have seen a couple more bees than usual and it turns out that the ingredient this blows out geraniol is said to attract bees not a big deal to me it apparently doesn t work for everyone i have always assumed that there is some sort of chemical i give off that makes mosquitos head straight for me bypassing everyone else i might be at a party where no one else even sees a mosquito and i leave with over a dozen bites i wonder if the geraniol somehow combines with whatever it is that i put out and neutralizes it this could explain why it would work for some people and not other people at this price it s worth it to find out if you are one of the people for whom it might work i figure if i replace the cartridge every weeks cartridge i will even be saving money because i d been going through cans of high deet bug spray per week
1,this unit is easy to load easy to maintain temperature and simply cooks the best barbeque i have not seen any other wood or charcoal smoker that can compare dollar for dollar you have complete control over how smokey the flavor is or isn t i only check the temp once every hour i have done full racks of ribs on a ribrack not babybacks either plus pork shoulders at once and could have fit more use all charcoal all wood or any combination i also use charwood because it burns so clean i recommend ordering the optional thermometer which fits in the built in opening in the right hand side of the big door holds up to lbs of meat has a drippings drain on the lower right firebox is easy to clean i use a garden trowel tomorrow i m doing racks of ribs lbs of chicken wings and corn on the cob i love it

1,pest control is a light hearted book which uses a fast pace and off the wall humor to make up for any depth problems standard story upstart assassin bursts onto the scene creating mayhem in the world of professional killers problem upstart assassin can t even fulfill a contract to rid a restaurant of roaches let alone kill some of the most guarded men in the world the story of bob dillon s flirtation with contract killers is a page turner not really out of suspense because you can t imagine that fitzhugh would subject his characters to anything other than a fairy tale ending but out of unabated curiosity you want to know how in the heck dillon and his cohorts will survive to breed another strain of hybrid bug eating bugs of course fitzhugh answers with simple and hilarious solutions which are towards the end of the book more and more absurd and predictable overall i m slightly embarrassed that i like this book as much as do nonetheless i would recommend it to anyone looking for an easy and humorous read
1,i like this watch it s good price and also cool look hey guys you will not lose anythings if you have one like it
0,i was anxious to hear an astounding modern yet retro dance disc from one of my favorite girl groups of the unfortunately instead of picking up on the latest influence of music in dance music what we get here is predominantly disco flavored tracks that sound painfully dated with some latin tones now and then the only semi retro electro tracks on here and my favorites are feel for you love bite your love is like a drug and marc almond s remix of venus the two lead singles move in my direction and look on the floor are not even the strongest tracks and the remixes on their singles don t make them much better i appreciate the commercial direction the girls have taken but you can still sound mainstream while being more sophisticated than this take a listen to the new madonna or even the kelly osbourne to hear some infectious melodies with an flair that don t melt down into total cheese unfortunately i just don t see us radio embracing any of the sounds on this disc but of course fans of bananarama should still add this one to their collection it s listenable if not up to today s standards
1,this is cute funny and it s not uncomforable i think it rocks i love this movie i even call my pet rabbit the rabbit with those big pointy teeth
0,i bought this product after reading that you can update the code list via a network connection or using a usb flash drive i have not been able to get either to work correctly after following their instructions on the datel website on how to update the codes using a usb drive it deleted my game saves on the memory card it also corrupted the memory card and corrupted saves on the card in slot i have had nothing but trouble with it it s slow and doesn t live up to the promises their customer support is lousy with a response that merely said sorry well thanks a lot to them just lost hours of game saves

1,this is an emotionally charged witty and brilliantly told drama of four friends struggling to understand marriage divorce intamacy and each other one of the best plays i ve seen read
1,i found the film malice to be a very intriguing and interesting murder mystery sure there are a lot of twist s in the film however that is what i found to be very good about this film especially the way these twist s were done there will be no spoilers in this review the film begin s with murders occuring in a small college town andy safian bill pullman is a college dean who happens to be suspected of these killings all circumstantial moreover he is having problems with his wife nicole kidman something happens to her and she blames andy for this to tell you would give away the film it seems as if one of andy s old school friends is now a practicing surgeon alec baldwin therefore she decides to leave him and sues both the medical facility that caused her such grief and the doctor balwin in particular who caused this grief to her but there is more to the story than meets the eye there are several stories going on at once first you have a serial killer secondly you have a distraught wife kidman blaming her ex husband and his doctor friend for what has happened to her but there is more to her than the viewer suspect s i will leave this to you to discover the film is better than the reviews warrant it is a very suspenseful film full of twists recommended
0,my son s best friend got one of those for christmas and we went to the lake to test it against my son s regular rc boat the hovercraft was very slow and not quite that maneuverable it hovered ok on water but couldn t handle sand or concrete the skirt slipped out of its track a couple times despite our being careful fitting it as best as we could filling with water the foam inside it didn t prevent the boat from being swamped by the smallest wave even in good shape it couldn t handle waves like the other boat the thin skirt finally ripped and the boat is pretty much unusable now big disapointment it was somewhat fun while it worked the concept was intriguing for the gearhead boys but once the novelty wore off the regular boat was a lot more exciting and all the kids prefered taking turns running that one
1,if you are a fan of the winter s solstice series than you will enjoy this cd especially if you like the earlier volumes with the more original pieces rather than mostly traditional christmas music

1,this was the first disney movie i watched as a child i would still watch it today disney successfully humanizes the movie to children by using friendly animals while still keeping the main storylines intact thumbs up to the music love goes on and on is a moving piece and even hits my hard heart parents with younger children be warned some scenes may frighten them

1,absolutely love this program i d been using norton for years and so was initially hesitant to switch its not as user friendly as norton and has the annoying habit of repeatedly asking for permission even after it has been granted on the upside this feature adds to its efficiency and gives the user complete control over all internet activity making it an exceptionally good security program
0,i have owned eleven vcom products and from now on they don t have my business the product touts itself in part as a vital tool when if your machine crashes if it does be prepared to shell out the cost for another complete program you are told that the program is already installed on another machine and you can t run it although this occurs after a lengthy and cumbersome installation process sadly customer assistance is no help emails are unanswered and you can t get through via phone what you do get from them once you register are constant emails about new products thanks folks version is also much slower than version support for by the way stopped abruptly when the new edition came out despite the functionality of that program for the price the software should work like a major player rather than a dollar bin special
0,i bought this for my three yr old and it does not work at all we have the britax roundabout carseat and there is not enough room for the pillow i returned it
1,as someone who has recently become more interested in a healthier organic way of life i decided to check out several magazines on the subject matter many did not strike my fancy for example i found organic style magazine to be a little too fashion and product oriented for my taste while mind body and spirit fitness seems a little too redundant and doesn t cover natural and organic living at all natural health however falls somewhere in between covering a nice array of topics including fitness diet natural remedies beauty and food recipes as someone who is not interested explicitly in holistic medicine and naturopathy i appreciate the diversity this magazine has to offer though many of the articles do cover ideas and products that aren t entirely natural or organic i still find them to be useful many items and articles though not all are vegetarian friendly as well as eco conscious which i appreciate one of my few complaints is that the articles can be short sometimes merely glossing over many topics however if one piques my interest it can be a decent jumping off point to do further research though i can t compare with the previous version of the magazine that everyone else seems to have preferred as i only began to pick this up at my local whole foods market in the last year i can say that i am impressed with what natural health has to offer it s readers sure there are several ads plaguing the pages but i still feel as though there are far fewer advertisements than many of the magazines on the shelves today besides some of the ads have led me to decent products i would not have known of otherwise furthermore at this price how can anyone really go wrong
1,seitenbacher is a fabulous soup mix one canister makes cups of broth which makes it incredibly inexpensive it s also delicious it makes a truly versatile soup base people love my nabeyakiudon japanese noodle soup matzoah ball soup jewish dumpling soup golden lentil stew indian bean stew all of which have seitenbacher as the base it works for people with allergies and food sensitivities no gluten no lactose no msg no soy it s all natural and vegetarian no gelatin and i can t emphasize enough the rich deep flavor
0,having been a fan of joan osborne s take of son of a preacher man on her original indie record and heat wave from the recent standing in the shadows of motown soundtrack i was looking forward to hearing this record of covers i was ultimately disappointed first of all i have to say there are two real gems on here that really needed to be updated one for its amazing vocal instrumental sound the spinners i ll be there and the other for its message timmy thomas why can t we live together to be sure there are some great tunes on here that i am always up for listening to such as stevie wonder s love s in need of love today and undisputed truth s smiling faces somtimes but osborne adds little to these when she does change things around the effect is questionable i know that norah jones has brought back the torch song style but osborne s bluesy take on edwin starr s war is seriously misguided the same is true when you rip the melody and add bland vocals to classics like aretha franklin s think or the band s the weight especially since the former could have really used some punch from such a powerful singer like osborne overall this was a missed opportunity i hope her upcoming record is a reinvention
0,avoid this cheapo release of these great film subpar prints certainly not from original elements wait for the good one to come out down the road
1,these are quite good tasting even though you have to buy several boxes rather than just one at a time the individual boxes are manageable enough for use over a period of time it would be nice as with most things if they were a bit less expensive and also didn t have to be bought in bulk but overall they re very good especially compared to some other organic offerings

0,there are some artists who have been active since the s and s and who are still producing vibrant excellent music paul simon say or bob dylan kate bush though she started a little later all of these artists have evolved past their original sound but are still great joni mitchell should have stopped when she was ahead maybe i don t rate as a jm fan because i ve only heard blue but i ve listened to that album hundreds of times times over the years i wanted to find out what she was up to since then and bought this album all i have to say is it was like nails on a chalkboard i was expecting her to change and grow but not into some pale ghost of the s droning on about the evils of commercialism and modernism the lyrics are old and tired and the instrumentation is hackneyed and stale too the only good lyrics on this album were provided by yates at least her paintings are good
1,i love these centipedes i like these more than the gummi bears they taste good too not to hard not to soft just right
0,one of my boys bought this item for me and well its ok for the price its kinda sticky on the skin unless you rub it in really well and the scent is extremly light which i dont like now if they were to make it stronger this would be a star product
1,i have been having severe back pain muscular and subsequent headaches on a daily basis for many months i finally brokedown and went to see one of my colleagues who is a physiatrist he recommended the theracane to me he is a physician who is both a dc doctor of chiropractic and a physician do this physician has been doing trigger point therapy including intramuscular needling to help release the painful knots in my back i find that i can use the theracane in between visits with noted relief this same doctor states that this condition is like diabetes and needs to be managed for life and thus the theracane allows for me to maintain i think the theracane is an ingenious invention i don t really have anything negative to say with the exception of the pain i am trying to manage the product arrived quickly after i ordered it and it is exactly as described
1,they are made so well operate smoothly all the time and fit so many useful features into a small package the other review about them just doesn t hold water you can open the knife with a few keys attached without a problem the keyring has to be on one end or the other but it is really not a hindrance
1,doctor livingstone i presume is undoubtedly one of the most well known quotes in history very few people however are familiar with the history underlying the meeting of dr david livingstone and henry morton stanley this book details the lives of the two men and the historical background through which they were thrown together livingstone one of the foremost explorers of his day is searching for the source of the nile river through a combination of bad luck poor planning disease weather natives etc livingstone is virtually stranded on the banks of lake tangyanika henry stanley a newspaper correspondent undertakes a rescue mission at the direction of his publicity hungry publisher this book details that mission and the international setting under which it took place the perils of african exploration in the late century cannot be overstated this book does an excellent job impressing this upon the reader i found this book very similar in style and experience to undaunted courage which detailed the voyage of discovery undertaken by lewis and clark and river of doubt dealing with theodore roosevelt s exploration of the amazon basin if you enjoyed either of these books you will like this one as well if you read this book and enjoy it i highly recommend the other two
0,i bought this it is sacriligious and nothing at all like the biblical story it is immoral i threw it in the trash because i did not want anyone else to see it
0,what a complete and utter waste of time its obvious how these guys got dubbed the nutroots
0,this doesn t work first time i tried it it seemed as if my eye liner smudged more so i tried it again and again and again i ve given up on it it totally doesn t work
0,it has pretty much all been said let s just say it again cause i m sure firaxis firefly will plant positive reviews here the game takes ages to load the voice acting is silly british australian herman s hermits the progression is totally linear ie the game fails to become more complicated at higher levels the graphics date to and the citizen fetching system is completely random and opaque sit and watch for awhile your huts will change size every thirty seconds most importantly boo sid boo you could ve produced this bad ripoff and called it anything but you called it civcity and even put a tiny civilopedia in it haven t you got enough money the civ series is brilliant don t cash it in
1,we originally set this gym up for our son when we moved into our new house and had nowhere to put him he was weeks old as time went on it just became convient to put him on the mat close to us it was really fun to watch him grow into all the toys he started by just swinging his arms and finally has learned to grab and interact with the toys he loves the star in the middle he could spend all day talking to that thing alone he loves this gym so much that we take it everywhere we go i highly suggest this gym for any baby it is something that us or the baby couldn t live without
1,i have had a weber silver b grill for several years i have found that the igniter works for about two years then just does has to be replaced this is an easy replacement and is not expensive this ignighter works as well as any i have seen and i think the minor cost and inconvenience of replacing the ignighter is offset by the quality of the grill
0,good lord people must be busier than i thought if you haven t been allowed to even think about your future after retirement then maybe you will get something out of this book for the rest of us this is drivel
1,my first digicam bought it years ago simple to use great pictures and a year ago and hundreds of pictures ago i dropped it no in its case on a cobblestone road no damage have never seen the need to replace it i like the common batteries it uses and the sd memory

0,i bought these skates for my almost yr old who wants to be like her big sister the skates are good overall they are easy enough to put on and take off the padding inside is nice the only drawback i can find is the the adjustment lever that keeps the wheels from rolling on setting changes by itself to setting which lets the wheels roll i am not sure if i just got a bad pair or if this happens with all of these kinds of skates i will keep them but it does get to be a hassle to have to keep putting them on the correct setting
1,i am thoroughly satisfied with my purchase the earrings were more beautiful than i expected i will definitely purchase jewelry from amazon in the future
0,all of the above reviews are correct they are nice looking and moderately functional i may pour some concrete to overcome some of the functional problems it has the stake needs to go deeper into the ground to keep it from coming out at however it was a great bargain and a star rating at it s current winter sale price of however it is a star rating i ll average them weighting it s current price and give it stars
1,this product satisfies about of what i wanted it to it accomplishes the purpose keeping the dog from jumping into the backseat however the bottom stabilizing feet are a little awkward to adjust and tend to fall out of the apparatus if you don t secure them i also had a little trouble keeping the horizontal bar parts from slipping downward overall this product was worth the or so dollars i paid for it
1,i was happy to order this early so they wouldn t run out but i later saw the same set at a local store there was only one left on the shelf so i m glad i ordered them anyway they are my youngest son s favorite cars to start off with every morning
1,bear naked granola is just fabulous i ve tried every granola around and bear naked strikes the right balance between crunchy sweet and ostensibly good for you and amazon s price certainly beats what you d pay at the store
0,wish i would have paid attention to this one the the previous review the cost for what you get is outrageous only reason i gave it one star is because there was no place to give is zero starts don t waste your money like i did find a more economical product plenty more choices on amazon btw
0,like you i read all the reviews i could of bottles travel systems baby swings cribs etc etc etc i loved the shape of these bottles very handy when needing your hand you can prop the bottle under your chin while feeding and the concept of the ventaire system made a lot of sense however months into using these bottles i became fed up with having to wash all of the different parts drying them thoroughly it s a must with these things and having to activate both the nipples and the ventaire plastic seal wasting valuable time and energy that should ve been spent with my family catching up on laundry cleaning the house cooking and grabbing naps in between i also work a full time job and didn t get home till pm every night the worst of all of it is that if you don t install the vent juuuuuuust so it leaks the person below who said it doesn t leak if you screw it on right hasn t met me i m years old and do believe i have learned how to screw on a stupid cap it s a hit or miss deal sometimes i would go a whole week without a leak and then out of the blue water everywhere and they re slow leaks too so it s not like you would notice right away it took like minutes before showing then i called playtex to ask them what the problem was and they thought my water might be too hot and breaking down the material so they kindly sent me some new ones well yeh that didn t work either it is a great idea but very bad design i finally threw my hands in the air and purchased evenflo s version of the angled bottle and now i am in heaven do yourself and your time a favor and don t waste the money

1,neat game but i shouldn t have any trouble killing a couple wolves at level the leveling system developer should have stayed off the crack pipe also i m the hero of kavatch but i don t want to be reminded of it every seconds the fact that i saved a town also apparently doesn t entitle me to even pick up an item if i don t own it w o being thrown in prison very realistic
1,and not just a half baked product placement tool bioware s decision to make the game pre date the movies was a great one because it gave them considerable creative freedom even within the confines of the star wars brand the biggest reason why kotor won over game of the year awards yes over is not because you get to swing a double bladed lightsaber around and use force powers it s because of the story a strong plot is crucial for every rpg and kotor doesn t disappoint this plot of course includes one of the biggest twists in video game history all you fans out there know what i m talking about if you don t then go out and buy this game now the game s principal characters while somewhat stereotypical i e bastila is the condescending socialite snob carth is the tough loner with a troubled past etc work very well together and have good chemistry including with you the created character for example if you play as a female character it soon becomes obvious that carth develops feelings for you but he feels slightly guilty because he lost his wife not too long ago you ll also find yourself acting as mediator when some of your allies don t get along with each other i e canderous and carth because they fought on opposite sides in the mandalorian wars that took place five years before and aside from the character development the game feels very rich in its star wars ness for example some of the names that bioware came up with for the planets and people feel and sound like george lucas himself approved them despite what i said earlier in this review cutting down your enemies with a lightsaber and looking good doing it has got to be one of the joys of kotor i admit that when i first got to dantooine and was on the verge of becoming a jedi i was trembling at excitement that i was going to build my own lightsaber as i wondered what color i was going to choose having said all that there are some things that keep this game from getting stars i felt the game was a bit linear being able to choose your planets in any order only gives the illusion of open ended gameplay i was hoping that the storyline would be different depending on whether i decide to be evil or good but everything plays the same save a few minor events and certain conversations also there is a doorway bug that causes you to sometimes get stuck when moving through a doorway or narrow corridors when this happens you can wiggle the thumbstick and free yourself i ve never had any real problems with this bug but it can get distracting also i found moving around in the menu screens to be problematic you press start to go to the main menu then you pull the trigger buttons to move between the screens but often i have to pull the trigger multiple times before the game responds also i m sure many people would agree that the game s graphics are not up to xbox standards even the is capable of doing better i don t usually gripe about graphics but the textures on some background buildings on taris are downright laughable overall i have to give bioware serious kudos for taking on a daunting task like creating a new star wars game and i sing their eternal praises for actually making it fun it is not a stretch to say that i bought an xbox just to play kotor and a few other titles but that s another story and i m glad i made the investment hey stop reading this and go play
1,i bought this obus forme king sized pillow because i thought it might stop my snoring i must admit to being surprised that the pillow actually did minimize my night time rattling if not eliminate it completely there have been reviews that mentioned the pillow had a strange odor at first i found that it did give off a smell similar to that of a new carpet or some plastics but that disappeared in just a few days and was never offensive my wife wanted to try my pillow and liked it so much she kept it i have just ordered a second pillow
1,this salamander designs rack is very well made and looks great it takes a few hours to assemble but the result is nicer than most home theater furniture out there unfortunately amazon s shipping via ups didn t go so well and the outer box arrived in very bad shape i was hoping that the inner box would protect the item but alas one of the two doors was damaged i m now trying to get amazon to replace the door but they can only exchange the whole unit the shipping box is completely destroyed so i ve been forced to contact the manufacturer directly crossing my fingers

0,i have owned several pairs of this very boot since and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter spring and fall each boot used top quality leather and vibram soles i actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot both pairs were very comfortable and durable with a look all to their own my third pair which was recently purchased were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots the leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as i began to snug up the laces the backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots i sent them back i did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs made in portugal to made in china the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in rockport

0,this is the latest in a never ending series of books trying to generalize non business world eg sports armed forces girl scouts religion nasa etc management techniques to the business world most possibly all are of little value because of major differences members constituting the varying organizations are motivated differently and face greatly significantly different situations what does eg a fighter pilot or football coach have in common with a pharmicist nurse professor financial analyst etc i have no idea key success factors vary from one business to another for merck it may be speed of developing new drugs getting through fda approval and motivating physicians to use them for nucor steel it undoubtedly rests much more on low cost production again what does either have to do with fighter pilots little if anything one is better off reading books from similar situations eg about wal mart if you are in retailing about allied signal or g e if you are managing a conglomerate and about new york community school district as managed by sy fliegel if you are in public school
1,you can get better tea if you re willing to deal with leaves but that s not practical for most of us especially for those who drink it at work like i do compare this to a budget brand bagged green tea like salada which i used to drink and you ll be able to tell the difference right away the tazo isn t overbearingly flavorful no green tea is but its subtle green taste is addictive as is the caffeine

0,i d always heard about interesting articles in this magazine but the mess of ads and people magazine gossip that lands with a big heavy thud on my doorstep every month is the most worthless magazine i ve ever made the mistake of purchasing it s pretentious tripe aimed at a small group of nyc media insiders self regarding movie celebs and those people who d like to be part of that world even when they occasionally hit on a compelling subject the writers are so narcissistic as to be truly repellent it d be more accurate simply to cut fair out of the title

1,i love hot sauce i have been a big fan of other insane hot sauces but the problem with them is that for the most part they cannot be put directly on food instead they need to be diluted before they re okay for consumption not this hot sauce it s perfectly hot enough yet not too hot to eat straight out of the bottle i put it on everything burger too blah with the normal condiments el yucateco can fix it shrimp cocktail not kicking el yucateco will show those shrimp who s boss i even use it to bring salsas up to the proper level of heat it s definitely hot if all you re used to is normal red colored vinegar water this hot sauce will open your eyes and set your mouth on fire but if you re looking for something with good flavor that ll keep you coming back for more this is the stuff

0,sticking the solar module on the side of the garage door opener like they instruct doesn t work the solar panel has to be right next to the lightbulb to get enough power to work i was able to mount it close enough to the lightbulb and make a small cutout in the cover to get it to fit you might not be able to depending on your garage door opener also the bracket that holds the laser module has too light a hold on the module it doesn t hold it in rotational position
1,we replaced an old larger and broken sunbeam bug snapper with this unit this is lighter and easier to handle we re in southern arizona so our bug season is just starting the unit works great but upon encountering a really big moth it sizzles for as long as ten seconds kind of gruesome if you re dealing with night flying insects this is the solution

0,i ve never been a fan of metallica i like ride the lightening master of puppets and that s it that s the extent of my enjoyment with their abilities however if there is one quality i ve always admired in metallica it is their lyrics they ve always had excellent lyrics in their songs and that was what got me to keep buying albums however i can t credit them for any lyrics on this one unfortunately we re dealing with a bunch of covers some of the songs are pretty good the only one i can say i really like is turn the page though seger s original version is leaps and bounds ahead of it it s got decent music and the vocals aren t bad metallica just couldn t figure out how to honor a classic and they occasionally sounded like james was trying to lift a thousand pounds while he sang leading his voice to sound overly forced other songs like killing time were not spared on this album unlike with turn the page metallica didn t even do a halfway decent job covering this they destroyed a pretty good song and to be honest metallica s guitarist just can t compete with sweet savage s vivian campbell tuesday s gone was also destroyed it was too slow and acoustic but not in the good way it was in the skynyrd original in this case james voice was terrible it sounded like he was bleeding the entire time and trying to ignore it that is at least the effect i get from it overall if you re a die hard fan you won t like this it just doesn t have what metallica did have for songs back with ride the lightening and master of puppets if you re just looking for some metallica you might as well get this as long as you are just a small fan and not a huge one otherwise this may come as a dissapointment

1,i used this to haul a pound inch long flat pack furniture box about miles on top of a toyota camry and it worked just fine i had my doubts when i bought it i lost an upholstered chair on the washington dc beltway once tied it down with rope and it took off like a kite but this highland carrier did the job when putting it together save yourself some aggravation and loop the straps through the plastic bases before you attach the bases to the crossbars the instructions tell you to do the reverse which makes the threading next to impossible the pieces attached firmly to the roof of my camry with flat metal hooks going on the sills of the open doors once the doors are closed there s no way the hooks can come out make sure the straps are tight before you close the doors this can be a little tricky as there seemed to be some slippage through the buckles but with a little tugging and wiggling they snugged up pretty well note that the rubber feet that fit on the plastic bases provide grip and protect your roof when the carrier is on but they fall off easily when it s not in use i don t know why they weren t permenently attached the maximum recommended load is pounds but i didn t test it to the limit the crossbars look sturdy but they re hollow metal tubes and they bounced a little under the weight of the box also the bars have a textured finish but seemed a little slippery so i wrapped some gritty no slip tape around them the kind used on stairsteps to prevent any slippage i attached the box to the carrier with two ratchet tie downs highly recommended over rope the tie down straps were looped once around the box and under each crossbar and the box didn t budge the whole trip home one other thing make sure to tie up any dangling straps the sound of them whacking against the roof of your car can be very disconcerting an inexpensive solution that s good for temporary use with light loads on short trips in cars that don t have roof racks update used the carrier to haul two of the same box on the camry bringing the load right up to the lb maximum rock solid all the way i laid the long boxes side by side with the longest width down to spread out the weight as much as possible then duct taped them together and fastened them down good and tight with tie downs and rope overkill perhaps but better safe than sorry and sued my next car will probably be a small suv but until then i m glad i have this carrier inexpensive easy to use and remove and does the job
1,as other people have pointed out this is a very solid watch i really am not afraid of it breaking if it falls or anything like that however this is partly due to its enormous thickness it s not that the diameter of the watch is surprisingly large it s how thick it is if you have a small wrist this watch is probably not for you as it will be very noticeable it s also not especially light obviously but it feels comfortable enough it keeps excellent time and i ve had no problems with the automatic signal searching

1,as a social worker in private psychotherapy practice i find that sometimes the work can be isolating and at times i question whether i should make more of an effort to consider the latest trends in psychotherapy mary pipher affirms that the classic skills that make a good therapist such as compassion empathy listening skills reframing and the ability to induce a sense of calm are timeless furthermore even if i wasn t a therapist i think i would still devour this book because her writing is a pleasure to read i highly recommend it for anyone just starting their career in therapy or those who have been in the field for decades this book is bound to become a classic

1,less technicolor and more monochromatic than its predecessor in like flint still uses broad strokes to great advantage in poking fun at the bond films the indomitable derek flint returns to save the world this time from a bevy of beauties who simultaneously raise the ire of the world s women while replacing powerful males with surgically altered substitutes leading to perhaps the most prescient line of dialogue in any film upon discovering that the man in the white house is not who he seems to be a disbelieving flint says an actor as president that is until a renegade zowie general steve inhat decides it s his turn to take the reins of power the delightful lee j cobb is back as flint s curmudgeonly boss cramden as are the secret agent s posse of female admirers and tv s batgirl yvonne craig even shows up as a russian ballerina in like flint feels more grown up than the previous film partly because the lighting and cinematography are more stark and partly because the humor is sometimes more rooted in satire than parody notions like the red scare being a feint to the very real dangers of corruption from within and the beauty industry actually having our worst interests in mind and charging a premium for them are slipped in with more obvious gags involving oversized eyebrows cross dressing and the bouncing sing a long ball only the crankiest among us are likely to find the juvenile sexism of either flint film worth comment as it s a staple of the genre meaning that the biggest weakness here is the same as the earlier effort a no frills dvd
1,i ve been a fan of the prince of persia series since i was a little kid pop was great pop was absolutely unreal pop was ehhh but then two years ago along came a game that changed everything prince of persia the sands of time the first game in this amazing adventure game trilogy took everyone s breath away the gameplay was original flawless and beautiful the storyline sucked you in and didn t let you go even after you d beaten it times over it was a flawless game last year the first sequel prince of persia warrior within was released while the game contained improvements in the quality of the graphics and the freeform fighting techniques the game was less pleasing to both critics and gamers ubisoft had turned the humrous witty intelligent prince from sands into an angry nu metal rocking humorlous scoundrel who seemed hellbent on ruining everyone s time while the story was equally as engaging as sands warrior failed because it simply was not as much fun to play luckily ubisoft saved the best for last the two thrones is easily one of the greatest games i have ever played in concluding one of the greatet videogame trilogies ever created ubisoft have developed a near flawless game it is as though they took the strengths from both games removed the weaknesses of the second game and created a thing of pure brilliance the two thrones contains all of the witty punning elements from the first game and mixes them with the exciting more violent elements from the second game while removing everying that ruined the prince s demeanor in the second game the original fun saracastic prince is back and largely because ubisoft has also brought back one of the things that made sands so great farrah farrah is the perfect foil to our hero she adds humor power creativity and definitely a sexiness to the game that warrior was lacking farrah s relationship with the prince is by far my favorite relationship i ve ever played in a videogame and ubisoft deserves big brownie points for bringing her back the gameplay in the two thrones is amazing throughout the game the gamer is occassionally forced to play as the dark prince as there are situations where the normal original prince is unable to get through in other games playing as two characters often appeared more of a gimmick than an actual integral part of the story but in the two thrones the reasoning behind the prince s frequent changing from prince to dark prince and back again is very well explained and very important to the overall story that two thrones is telling the fight scenes are epicly fun to play this prince has more moves than he had in the two last games combined and his battle techniques are a joy to use the new speed kill method of killing some opponents adds a certain amount of skill and brutality to many fights that otherwise would have seemed boring and taken far too long to complete i welcomed the addition of the speed kills once i fully learned how to use them the prince still moves as acrobatically as ever there is still wall running jumping flipping handsprings etc the only real notable movement difference is when the gamer plays as the dark prince the dark prince s chain weapon thing can be used to grab onto bars that are are away or objects that would otherwise be out of reach and the prince can then swing over to them it s not that different from anything the prince has done before but it was definitely fun to do and worked well with the flow of the game all in all i rate this the best of the new sands pop trilogy it s an awesome game that should be played by anyone who has ever enjoyed a person adventure game if you haven t played either one of the first two games be warned the storyline is actually rather complex and you will be missing much of the story if you haven t played the first two games if you have played the first two games this story is a terrific conclusion to the prince s tale and the way it wraps around back to the beginning of the trilogy floored me when i finished it buy this game something worth noting after you beat the game you unlock many videos chief among these is the alternate real ending to warrior within that was formerly only available if you beat warrior after collecting all the life upgrades so if you beat warrior without all the life upgrades and didn t see the real ending beating this game shows it to you in the video collection
0,after twice sending the unit back to the factory the unit worked for two weeks and again would not turn on i tried all the suggestions made by the factory the following year i opened the unit and tried to see what was wrong i found totally frozen fan bearings i suppose that the cartriges to repel mosquitoes are corrosive and corroded the bearings to end my agonies with the unit i took it to the garbage dump the unit is cheaply made and therefore unreliable when it worked it worked well i believe it cost me about one dollar per killed mosquito
0,the size of this swing is about all it has going for it and it is far from the best swing out there i put the swing on the speed and it barely moves so much for the other speeds my daughter is starting to explore her surroundings and get into things which brings me to what i hate most about this swing my daughter pulls herself into a straight up sitting position by holding onto the bars and stops the swing looking like she is going to fall out i just pray that buckle is secure she also likes to get her head trapped in between the legs and the swing bars to where her head is hitting the bars so i don t like leaving her in the room by herself when she is in this swing if you don t like to get house work done or take showers this swing might be for you
0,this is an excellent story well told in script and action however it is quite different from the version i saw on a big theater screen this dvd has speeded up the action and the english translation dialogue is presented in such rapid changes that it is virtually impossible to read and follow the dialogue i was very disapointed in this dvd version and would not recommend it to friends

0,i bought this item as a gift and it ended up becoming mine i have to say i am greatly dissatisfied here are some main issues i am having with the camera it is very poorly designed the look and the feel of the camera are not elegant buttons are really ugly and operating the camera is awkward and for some functions requires both hands to operate the camera has been having issues with turning on and off occasionally the worst by far is the picture quality colors are just plain terrible automatic settings are a disaster of photography i have used a canon before getting this one the canon was far superior in quality colors lighting i don t need large files of trash i am perfectly fine with smaller files with great pictures as a result i am strongly recommending getting a different camera i have had great experiences with canon and seems like sony and nikon are doind a good job too but hp must stop making cameras and indeed many other devices

0,bought this for our year old son for x mas i was very disappointed with the quality of this pendant and returned it the very next day the chain looked and felt like plastic my initial reaction when i took it out of the box and felt how light it was in my hand was that it came from a bubble gum machine went to a christian bookstore the next day and found a beautiful sterling silver cross pendant for that was times better than this one

1,i checked the from panasonic and the canon camcorders in that price range this is the best i found if you have the extra money the new hdv camcorder from sony might be your best bet important the ccd issues referred in other user comments are real although i don t know if it will also apply to this new model it actually happened on my previous sony i purchased a years warranty from sony for my dcr years is a good product life so i will take the risk of ccd failure after that period and enjoy this great product until then great features are small but feels solid megapixel pictures impressive quality for camcorder incredible low light performance nice touch screen great features battery life is actually not too bad from original battery but you might need an extra what i did not like cannot take full size pictures in camera mode only in memory mode limited zoom compared to most new camcorders and lots of required extra svideo cable ilink cable video light decent size memory stick extended warranty i am still giving this a stars overall
1,gun aims to be the western version of gta but falls short taking the non linear story and side mission type action genre is a good idea but the game just feels incomplete to me it is fun to play but on my medium high end pentium ghz mb ram geforce gt system the framerate slows down quite a bit not just when entering new environments but at random times when i m wondering why the game probably wasn t fully tested the voice acting is good but the graphics aren t spectacular even at the highest level of course i had to crank down the graphics to increase the performance gameplay isn t bad but gta is much better as tasks are more difficult and require more time to accomplish the game took about hours to beat the story missions and hours for me to acquire completion i also had an issue with not being able to assign some keys like the semicolon key to the game i hope there is a patch to correct annoying issues like this a funny part of the game is when talking to the people that give you tasks like the indian hunter marshal and others they talk with their hands and sometimes their hands move even when they re not saying anything it s downright hilarious in an untested sort of way the game is good and received an editor s choice award in pc gamer i think it s overrated but they did mention framerate hits and lower standard graphics as gun s weaknesses i give this game a due to the many performance graphical issues i ve experienced activision online technical support hasn t proven its worth to me at least not yet hopefully a patch will come out

0,the mid size is actually quite large had i to do it over again i would just get the original size because that would be sufficient i like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes i found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled it stayed on very well that was a concern that i had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents i did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors the visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering i chose purple and it is a beautiful shade the bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors
1,this is beautiful birdbath if placed on solid ground walkway concrete it will be great however if placed in mulch or in the landscape it is not weighted heavily on the bottom a wind will not send it sailing but will cause it to tip however it is beautiful and looks great while it is upright i am still trying to figure out how to stabilize in the landscape mulch
1,at this camera takes some of the clearest and visually stunning pictures i have ever taken with a digital camera the clarity and detail alone are reason to get this camera the display although pooh poohed by others as too small is quite large to me the cameras small lithe design is another selling point nothing bulky about this camera you can put it in your front pants pocket if you needed to do yourself a favor and get this camera you won t regret it
1,this outstanding effort by prince consists of mostly spare jazzy r b tunes driven by incredibly loose free flowing live instrumentation i could only begin to tell you about the stylistic variety on this album with the three disc format there is a lot to absorb and the third disc really can largely be done without but the first two truly do rank amongst his best work it should also be noted how especially romantic prince is on this album this album was made around the time that he entered into his first marriage and it shows because this c d is overflowing with outstanding romantic ballads most of his albums only contain one or two ballads so if you ve been longing for an album that includes more then this album should really appeal to you this c d does not fit into the standard prince mold i know that it is perhaps a bit oxymoronic to speak of a prince mold but his personal signature is not quite as bold on this album as it is on many of his other works even those that are admittedly not as good the reason for this is that prince follows rather than leads on a good portion of this album the fact that there are two covers on the first disc alone shows that prince was in the mood to do what was being done instead of doing something new he covers songs by bonnie raitt and the stylistics which is unsual for this constant innovator but this album is so great because he is so skillful that he does it better than almost anyone else one minor problem that i notice is that it seems that on a few songs particularly on the first disc prince just doesn t pay much attention to the lyrics there are too many generic r b come ons and cheesy cliche s catch phrases such as gettin your groove on and prince is much too clever witty and creative to resort to such things but really that is just a minor quibble because the music truly is consistently outstanding throughout the first two discs and then he has songs such as soul sanctuary and let s have a baby which are two of the most well written ballads that i ve heard from him in this bed i scream is just magnificent both lyrically and musically he takes the lead again on this track and he does it in a major way this clever poetic and romantic track has an infectiously catchy both rhythm and melody that would easily pack any dance floor other highly impressive moments include the high powered funk of we gets up the absolutely brilliant and stunning arrangement on curious child and the sincere pure passion of the just so perfect r b gospel blend of savior joint joint is impressive just for having so much variety in terms of sounds and elements with each part so effectively enhancing a different part of the story the first two discs are really solid overall the third disc however finds prince trying his hand at techno and other forms of conventional dance club music and the results are not very impressive but i don t see how they could be even coming from prince techno for the most part is insanely repetitive monotonous and downright drone like there are only three songs on disc three that were really worth it slave my computer and the title track well maybe four his cover of la la means i love you is actually really good too those songs could have been put on the first two discs and the disc really could have been omitted the most impressive feat that he manages to accomplish on this entire album is making a great chorus and a great song out of the line www dot emale dot com on emale i was unaware of this feat for a while because i used to always skip this song because it started off with that really annoying s g funk whistle so overall this album really does rank amongst prince s best work and it should especially appeal to those who would like to see him do more ballads and dive into more r b
0,i was happy at first when i got this memory card but when my phone crashed the memory card was completely wiped out i was ok with the memory card getting wiped out but when i tried re formatting the card my phone computer and laptop couldnt even read the card so i ended up throwing it away i guess you really get what you pay for

0,i played with this at a specialty toy store and was pretty disappointed with it i thought i wanted this for my son after seeing it online but i m so glad we got to try it at a store first my toddler showed almost no interest in it it looked hard to use and not at all fun however it looked like it was well made of good wood and with good stains paint and finishes we ve had more fun with a plastic food container that i cut a square shape on the lid and my son fills it up with his wooden abc blocks btw you can do the same using matchbox cars peek a blocks etc just use a different plastic food container yogurt sour cream powdered drinks etc for each shape
1,i recently picked this game up because the laptop i had purchased for college was finally a computer powerful enough to run it it is easily one of the best computer games i ve ever played the playing world is massive you can literally walk to any mountain or monument you see in the distance and there are multiple ways to accomplish a goal and or solve a mission the basic plot is this you are jack carver who has accompanied a woman to a part of micronesia for undisclosed reasons she turns out to be a cia agent and before long she is kidnapped and you are fighting for your life against an army of well trained mercenaries it s a fairly generic shooter plot but it gets the point across and ties everything together well the enemy ai is unbelievably good the soldiers work together to take you down all the while dropping hilariously bad one liners like how do you like those apples right between the eyes mofo i m gonna tear you a new one the shootouts that result in this game are a blast you really have to get good cover and strategize your fight it s the first shooter i ve played that makes me feel like i m actually in an action movie the vehicles are one of the game s biggest highlights if you want to move quicker downstream you can snipe at occupants of the frequent patrol boats on the water and steal their ride you can often obtain rvs and atvs and at one point in the game a forklift for reasons unknown these are a blast as you can drive right through the enemies firing at you one thing i enjoy doing is driving full speed at an enemy and bailing out at the last second always good fun the game is also a great challenge i just completed the game on the medium setting and it was still almost impossible in places fighting the trigens the small monkey like creatures with claws is a nightmare on any diffculty as they can outrun and outjump you and kill you with often a single hit i strongly suggest using the sniper rifle or a powerful machine gun other than the on them at long distance before they really mess you up in short this is the best fps i have ever played and probably one of the best computer games ever made overall highly recommended on a side note not that it matters to me but i m personally surprised this game got a mature rating there is barely any blood at all and none of it sticks on the floor and when shot with a rocket launcher people don t explode like normally in mature rated shooters this game should have been rated teen

0,it s not just that if lucy fell is a bad film of what comes out of hollywood is uninspired formulaic dross just like it and usually you can just shrug it off and forget about it what makes this movie memorably remarkably bad is writer director star eric schaeffer s nauseatingly immense sense of self regard which arises from every frame like the stench of yesterday s roadkill the mere fact that the photogenically challenged mr schaeffer should have the likes of elle macpherson tell him he s cute speaks volumes

0,i did not read the book but i did look it over carefully i was hoping it would be a clear step by step guide to using ibd to apply the canslim method there is so much information in the paper that it is not easy to apply all the techniques in an efficient manner there are almost too many choices and directions possible this book is not a step by step guide nor is it all that clear i did find it to be unnecessarily wordy and vague it just seems to go over the whole paper in a long winded fashion but does not get down to the nuts and bolts of smart investing as i was hoping it would refer to william o neil s books for better guidance about how to invest also if you are a subscriber there is a large amount of useful information on the ibd website at investors com
0,i bought this based on reviews of bass queen in the mix to me it sounds like the west coast edition of northern exposure without the house beat in other words its very electronic sounding almost completely non vocal and not very funky at all i listened to eargasm by plump dj s and icey s funky breaks after this and it s definitely missing variety skill in mixing and that neck snapping funky quality that make the plumps and icey so indispensible not too bad but not that interesting either i prefer her mixtress and still have not heard bass queen btw my speakers are flat down to below hz and i didn t find the recording quality or the bass that impressive listen to crystal method s phd or block rockin beats by chemical brothers after this to see what i mean

1,prepare yourself for an illuminating evening which begins in an upscale new york bar but slowly degenerates into visiting some of the more unseamly locations of the big city the story revolves around rodger campbell scott an egotistic insecure overly analytical wordsmith who has just been dumped by his female boss isabella rossellini his sixteen year old nephew nick jesse eisenberg unexpectedly shows up in his office and roger decides to break the young boy in new york style prepare for a crash course in how to pick up a woman as taught in the sometimes alluring often times sleazy world of uncle roger the proverbial lounge lizzard dialogue is everything in this film and most of it comes from the incredibly glib and searing tongue of the recently scorned roger who has yet to learn how to deal with rejection roger is the self proclaimed prophet of the gender wars and is determined to teach his naive nephew how to cope with the opposite sex this is as close to a one man show as you can get and campbell scott pulls it off in amazing fashion this is a film that demands your full attention the dialogue comes fast and furious and you really don t want to miss a thing in this somewhat pessimistic but well contructed production
1,i am very pleased with the way this remote performs i have my computer conected to my tv and with this remote i am able to control my computer from the living room to watch tv watch dvds that i have on my hard drives and listen to music beyond media works great with the remote and is very user friendly
0,i registered for and received these medela bags after using all i got a few free lansinoh bags with my breast pad purchase wow i will never go back to medela the reason i registered for them is because everyone says they are strong and don t leak well this is the only good feature the lansinoh bag is strong as well easy to close double zip lock vs medela s bothersome twisty ties easy to get the air out unlike medela s and the lansinoh s take up way less room in the freezer stacking medela bags in the freezer is difficult because of their shape and thawing will be difficult because i can see i ll need to watch that the milk doesn t spill out the top with lansinoh i won t have to worry about that my medela bags haven t split in the freezer i ll give them that but neither has my lansinoh bag

1,unlike a lot of craft magazines for parents teachers this magazine contains projects that are easy for kids to do that don t take a lot of expensive or difficult to find materials and that are very attractive when finished i also like the fact that most of the projects allow kids to take an idea and run with it very important when it comes to encouraging creativity
0,i wish i d read the reviews before buying this product i would have saved us money and aggravation i bought these for my son s christmas present this year he was really excited about playing with them with his sister the problem is we haven t been able to find one single spot inside or out where we can get reception on both units even when you can pick up one person on the handset the sound is so staticky and crackly that you can barely make out what the person is saying what s the point my kids got so frustrated in the first couple of days that they dumped them in the toybox and haven t played with them since what an incredible waste of money and such a let down for the kids on christmas it s pretty rotten that national geographic can conscience putting this piece of junk on the market don t make my mistake heed these reviews this is a must avoid product
0,i m watching the film right now and it is perhaps the most moronic and stupidly annoying film i ve ever seen there s nothing amusing going on it s all fluff and show it is such garbage i find it offensively stupid
0,this app is just horrendous it is literally nothing more than a moving map i m serious there are no features at all to make things worse when zoomed out the display is littered with the names of every little village and hamlet you ve never heard of leaving the names of recognizable towns a cities nowhere to be found also at these zoom levels most roads streets and highways are not visible making navigation impossible this app does not even come close to qualifying as a gps nav system even as a moving map it s pretty well useless unless you re zoomed into about yards even though this app was a freebie included with trips and streets which is a very nice capable app it s still maddening that microsoft would allow such a eggregiously lame program to be released if it were possible to give this program negative stars and charge microsoft with a crime i d do it in a heartbeat
1,i m very happy with the craftsmanship of the swoard and the delivery service the exactness of the finish and the wrap was done with every bit of care as a swoard made of metal my son was also very happy with the workmanship and quality when he opened it on christmas thanks everyone g hanso
1,pros very tasty natural no preservatives cons difficult to che
0,i bought this to puree my month old daughter s homemade baby foods you put the blade at the bottom of the cup load the food in then put a protective plate and finally put the top piece which contains the motor on top the concept seemed good and it is a compact size cons the cup holds less than cup of food if you go over that amount any liquids in the food start to splatter through and make a mess and sometimes causes the motor to stop running guess it shorts it out and i have to wait until it dries out before i can start again if you re trying to make enough to freez cubes of food you ll have to puree several batches you can only run the motor for short periods of time up to seconds max or something like that for some foods this is fine for soft foods but if trying to puree meats for example it sometimes takes longer than that and it becomes a hassle having to grind wait grind wait the motor that powers the blade is way too slow cooked chicken or beef ends up being too lumpy since you really need a faster blade to puree them i ve found that the for pureering baby foods the best thing to use is a blender since the blade speed is much faster and the design helps to draw foods down to the bottom so things can get more evenly pureed don t waste your money on buying this
0,this is the worst shaver i have ever used it is cheaply made and completely useless don t waste your mone

0,perfectly in keeping with the imperialist ethos that he so proudly and loudly espouses boot has foisted upon us a book that rests entirely on the labors of others lacking even the slightest trace of shame he plunders concepts and ideas from anyplace in the intellisphere he chooses as a result there s nary a new thought nor insight to be found anywhere within these pages even more pitiably like a renegade third world nuclear scientist trying to sanitize his clandestinely acquired apparatus of any markings that might possibly identify its source boot assiduously scrubs away any subtleties and nuance that the original thoughts may have possessed one wearies quickly of the manichaean results and like any ideologically driven but technically inept would be nuclear or social engineer he fails utterly in his attempt to enrich his raw material even minimally succeeding only in rendering it more toxic and hazardous than it originally was why even the title itself has been purloined from alistair home s underground classic a savage war of peace considering that home s tome arrives at essentially the opposite conclusions from boot s this is irony most profound it is scarcely surprising then that recent history has thoroughly discredited the philosophies and policies so ear splittingly trumpeted in boot s book thus rendering moot any lingering interest one might have had in perusing it unless one wishes to take counsel for the future by ruminating upon the ozymandian ruins of boot s espoused belief system recently reprinted and highly recommended
0,i picked up a bag of these at my local health food store a few months ago after hearing that pirate s booty was a great product these tasted rather odd to me and i wound up getting rid of the bag as quickly as possible puffed corn and a chocolate type of taste just don t go well together in my opinion it might have been ok if the cocoa was all you could taste but that was not the case here
0,be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold cards i bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards my id and some cash hence there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet from the picture it looks as though the business card side is just a slot whereas in reality it is actually a pouch like most of the other card holders other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother which takes up quite a bit of space the leather itself is very low quality and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it furthermore on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was made in china i mean china is great and all but if you re on a date and you say hey let me pay for this and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying made in china well you are pretty much a schmuck i cut mine out with a pair of scissors but there are still some remnants so if you like being low class by all means buy this wallet i personally don t care about my wallet very much so i am keeping it and going to use it but i almost returned it it is most definitely a solid stars hope this helps
1,for the bucks you pay here you get the phone plus minutes of airtime that s not a bad deal considering if you bought the phone itself elsewhere it would be bucks and buying the airtime separately would also total approximately some odd bucks or so plus tax so cost works about to be about the same frankly i see no savings to buying this phone on this site versus elsewhere regarding the sim card i noticed nothing unusual or problematic about insertion a sim card is a delicate silicon apparatus that is highly susceptible to esd electro static discharge just like computer ram is esd is probably the primary reason why so many reviewers phones here have failed i d bet every single one of them reside in geographical locations where the weather is cold and snows before you handle the sim card you should ground yourself by touching something metal otherwise you run the risk of destroying the sim card with esd the phone itself is ok it s basic emphasis on the basic i just transferred my mobile from a motorola and notwithstanding the annoying polyphonic ringtones on the about the only edge the has over the is the color display please also note that does not have any kind of interface as to a pc so that means you are stuck with the bundled ringtones and the wallpaper imo motorola could have added a port to accomodate a usb interface to this model it was short sighted and just dumb not to considering the also in the same price range has such a port voicemail is extremely problematic to set up at this time i only just had the phone activated on this past saturday and it took over hours for my number to be transferred over to the new phone also it is an entirely new network in southern california the network this model tracfone uses is cingular suffice it to say i followed all the instructions on the website explicitly however cingular just keeps regurgitating its canned message that it doesn t recognize my number and to input my voicemail number and around and around it goes i anticipate nothing but problems with technical support when i contact them they are very polite as customer service reps however they can barely speak or understand english i am envisioning hours of bs with the call i have to make because past experience has indicated to me that these reps are not technical whatsoever note to tracfone customer service reps from mexico who can barely communicate with your american consumers are most assuredly not tech support also i wasn t overly impressed with the keypad where it concerns text messaging the is actually more intuitive it s much easier to use but the does have one advantage in this regard text messages cost only units versus on the tracfone was deducting units for each incoming and outgoing text message i m not sure why that is considering the deduction of units has zip to do with the model of the phone it should be one uniform deduction across the board consumers should contact tracfone customer service and inquire about this phenomenon bottom line is that i would recommend this phone to anyone who is upgrading from a monochromatic led phone and wants an inexpensive phone with a much easier on the eyes color display inexpensive as in you bought it from a retailer for bucks but if you want pretty new ringtones and wallpaper and a little more flexibility then get yourself a nokia for the same money you spend here the nokia is a better phone it has a usb port a speakerphone plus other extras and you probably won t have any trouble setting up the voicemail either

1,i d have to start off saying that morrowind has been one of the most unique rpg s i ve played it s been at least as immersive and engaging as baldur s gate or planescape torment the developers accomplished what they wanted to to make a game where one can do as he she pleases there are countless ways to play through this game playing through as a thief type character is by far different than playing through as a more combat oriented character the world is huge and it takes hours upon hours to explore there s so much that if you don t stop and turn around sometimes you re bound to miss the enterance to an anscesteral tomb or a smugglers cave now about some technical things i m running this game on a ghz memory ti gpu the game runs great at resolution with full shadows and distance since the graphics are a little dated and i more than excede the recommended system i ve chosen to install sevaral mods which is another great way to keep this game fresh most notably the better bodies better heads and morrowind comes alive the first make the humanoid people look less blocky and more realistic the morrowind comes alive adds many more npc s generic travelers to ones that have something to offer be it goods to sell or hostile bandits with nice looot at random places giving the game even more of an immersion factor over all i highly recommend this game in fact i bought it to keep me from wanting to play world of warcraft and it s worked
0,don t buy this unless you plan on attaching the remote to your forehead with duct tape if you lose the remote you cannot operate the moon the moon also has an automatic time that it comes on it s supposed to be when it gets dark but it comes on way too early to be any good because nobody is in their room that early and it only stays on for minutes when it comes on by itself because its too early you can barely notice it is on

0,i couldn t finish this book after readng fairytale misfit insecure caucasian male falls for asian stripper prostitute after she listens to him talk about the odor of his sweat in the outdoor markets i thought possibly this story reveals a lot about olen butler he wrote about this relationship with such relish he sounds to me like a p c caucasian who is drawn in patronizing fashion to the otherness of asian people and doesn t see them for what they are just wants them to appreciate big strong white man i thought it interesting that in the story the woman never mentions to the man that she already has a young son living with her mother so she was not honest with him but olen butler wrote about her as if this stripper pros was wonderful the kind of wife any man would want i shook my head and thought you have issues probably if she were caucasian he would not want to get near her for fear of catching something after this the other stories just did not appeal to me

0,since purchasing this executive set i have purchased another one at a local store although both sets are relatively the same the instruction package with my second set is much better the sea monkeys in the executive set lasted about a month and a half this was due to the fact that the instructions on how to care for them were very vague we did not know that you needed to add air to the water or that over feeding was extremely bad for them the instructions in the sea monkey set we bought locally were very good and we have now had sea monkeys for over months i believe the executive set is overpriced as well
0,we bought this when our baby was born months ago only used it a few times until recently he loves it now to get him to sleep the problem lies in that at am my husband and i awake to hear the mobile playing scares us to death since no one else should be around to start it we go into the nursery and our child is holding it playing with the animals the clip that holds the umbrella part had broken off causing the mobile to fall on the baby he thought it was the funniest thing in the world he was okay thank god but the little plastic hook piece was in his hand if you have a month old child you know that they eat everything they can find i thank god that he didnt put that in his mouth it is a great soother for the baby but be sure there are no defects every day like i said before other than this it has been great

1,the man of her dreams the woman of his is a book that is critically necessary today in light of our divorce culture sadly it equally affects christians the sames as non christians joel pulls no punches in assigning the blame to men s arrogance and poor exploitive biblical exegesis the back and forth style communicates the same cooperation and give and take necessary for successful marriages this book is must read for the engaged newlyweds and those struggling to stay together all cliches aside this is a must read rodrick burton author the moral state of black america

1,i find most stoner movies to be too juvenile to bother with this is not a typical stoner movie though because the leads are not slacker losers they re intelligent guys one s an investment banker the other an aspiring med student who happen to like to hang out together and smoke dope which truth be told is pretty accurate of a lot of twenty somethings today the best bits are hilarious watch out for the british twin sisters the evangelical tow truck driver and neil patrick harris doogie howser as a sex crazed drug addled party animal the only scene that fell flat for me was the one with the cheetah pointless and not funny that said this is not highbrow humor but if this were just a series of frat boy jokes it would have fallen as flat as most other movies of the genre what really elevates this movie is the harold and kumar characters silly antics aside these guys are really likeable and have great on screen buddy chemistry i don t know why i haven t seen john cho and kal penn in more movies but the ending makes me hopeful that there will be a sequel
0,fresh horses on paper would have seemed to have been a perfect hit script you had molly ringwald with her porcelain skin and delicately curly red blonde hair you had andrew mccarthy with his boyish charm but also the male strength beginning to come through you had a romantic triangle you had the class divide the brat pack was loved by millions how could this fail the problem really does seem to come down to the actors themselves there s very little energy at all to this story which is supposedly about passion overcoming logic molly is a yr old girl in rural kentucky when her stepfather begins fondling her and her mother does little to help molly tries for the only escape she can find marrying the older bad man in town viggo mortensen she claims she never slept with viggo only used him for escape then viggo s father began fondling her and now she wants out of this house as well to get momentary relief from her homelife she hangs out at a friend s home which is a hour party here she runs into andrew andrew is a very serious student who has just gotten engaged to his high class wealthy girlfriend the girlfriend rambles on and on about china patterns having children and living the perfect life andrew goes with the flow until he sees molly and is instantly in lust molly leads him to believe she s single and interested in him it takes maybe days before he s sleeping with her to his credit he does tell his fiancee promptly and breaks off the engagement you d think everything was wonderful now right however andrew learns from friends about molly s lies he decides to keep seeing her anyway however he doesn t want to introduce her to his family and has no intention of marrying her he says he loves her but his feelings seem to be more related to sex at one point he even gives her a wad of cash to buy her off there s a telling scene near the end when andrew thinks molly has been publicly stripped by her husband andrew storms off to their house to have a talk with viggo andrew is deliberately rude laughing at viggo s artwork and putting him down but it s viggo who is the calm one here when molly shows up viggo points out that molly s been doing all this lying and scheming so that andrew would be a knight in shining armor and ride off with her he asks andrew if you re saying i m not good enough for her it seems that you think you re too good for her right andrew finds himself agreeing that he won t take on molly himself he wants to get molly away from viggo but then is going to abandon her to her own means how could he figure that molly would be better off with nobody at all vs with viggo fast forward to a year later and molly has in fact found herself a wealthy college boy to take care of her and is taking classes again she s happy and andrew is sad i suppose you have to give them credit for a not typical hollywood ending to the story the landscapes are often gorgeous and the various details of high class low class city country are all played nicely against each other so the problem really comes down to the main actors molly and andrew maybe have gotten too used to playing ensemble roles where each person just has to be a stereotype without a lot of depth you really get a sense of shallowness when you re watching this movie andrew has an entire life including a long term romance that he s set in in just days he s thrown it all away for molly but you never get any real sense that he cares about her molly was supposedly taking some quite desperate steps to find safety in her life including seducing and lying to andrew in order to convince him to rescue her but she never seems to care much either intriguingly only people really seem to have depth in this movie one is ben stiller andrew s best friend it s ironic because ben s character is shallow and cares more for himself than for those around him even so ben really seems authentic as someone who isn t used to having to worry about others but who really does try his best many times to get andrew to wake up to reality the other is viggo mortensen you only glimpse viggo once until the end of the movie he s just referred to as a rough guy who has done many bad things when you actually encounter viggo after andrew has in essence broken into his house to confront him you re prepared for the worst however viggo is very patient very well spoken and quite intelligent in his commentary he doesn t thrash andrew for sleeping with his wife instead he lays out the situation and makes both andrew and molly face their failings molly deliberately lied and used andrew as a tool of getting a better life andrew for his part knew he d never actually rescue molly but led her on repeatedly to have time with her some have said this is the worst movie ever many sections of it can be very painful to watch however i do find glimmers of meaning especially in the ending discussion with viggo even there though you would think this would be a moment of great soul searching for andrew and molly instead both seem to think yeah i guess that s true oh well see ya i don t mind gloomy movies at all in fact i really appreciate them sometimes however if a movie has no depth of character or quality acting it just makes the whole experience fall flat

0,i loved shedaisy s first album the whole shebang and i also really enjoy their christmas albumn they have beautiful voices and i love the three part harmonies they come up with i was very excited to get their newest album but i was sure dissapointed this is a very dark and depressing album almost every song is about lost love also all the songs but are slow where is the upbeat shedaisy i fell in love with i would suggest passing this one up and instead just listening to the whole shebang again still i look forward to what the future may bring from them these sisters have alot of talent

1,richard fortney s earth is a survey in mostly layman s terms of the geological history of the earth and how it relates to humankind fortney tells the story by means of a journey around the earth selecting a series of locations where the earth s geology is apparent and usually the meaning of that geology was debated by scholars to a greater understanding fortney starts at mount vesuvius in italy preceeds to the hawaiian islands hence to the swiss alps and to other locations aroudn the world fortney relates the geology of each chosen location to plate tectonics as a means to explain how each terrain come to be the way it is this leads into extended and sometimes fascinating discussions of the former alignements of the continents in prior ages such as the supercontinent of gondwana for each location fortney also relates the effects of the terrain on the history of the humans who have lived in that location along the way fortney drives home the sheer vastness of the timescale of earth and its geological processes the dedicated reader will view his landscape with a new perspective fortney is a gifted writer with a good eye for the illustrative anecdote large portions of this book will be fascinating to the reader with at least some schooling in the sciences it turns out for example that the complicated geology of newfoundland results from its origin as pieces of three different tectonic plates north america ocean bottom and northern europe the descriptions of northwest scotland as the remains of truly ancient mountains are put into appropriate scale in part by fortney s historical anecdotes and by his experiences of rockhounding in the often cold rainy weather of the scottish highlands the narrative runs a little long at over pages and fortney s explanations will sometimes outrun the scientific background of the average reader nevertheless this book is highly recommended to the reader with at least a casual interest in geology and its links to human history

1,i love this film everyone must see it at least once just as everyone should taste ice cream or smell a bouquet of fresh lilies of the valley or fall in love ya gotta see this la strada is part of a body of work that has at its core a thread of autobiographical sentiment so powerful and mysterious that scholars are still dissecting his films frame by frame although fellini says in the criterion collection dvd extra i have no message for humanity i am sorry we still believe that if we can decode the images stories fantasies and dreams of fellini s experience imagination we will find profound truths certainly the experience of viewing a fellini film has proven to be worthwhile to a vast audience across geographic linguistic and cultural boundaries and over time there s something to this fellini guy s stuff but what the heck is it i think fellini s films are distillations of beauty humor dreams pathos nightmares and the pleasure and pain of living when fellini insists that he doesn t have a message he is probably right he s not trying to sell ideas he is only trying to give form to his thoughts and dreams and nightmares and fantasies and experiences and memories the result is something we would call art for those of us susceptible to the aesthetic fellini is a master la strada is a film with a neorealist core the ravaged countryside the long lonely vistas of fields the sea and the faces of poverty belong in large part to the neorealist post war films that look unflinchingly at harsh realities of a war torn italy the circus which here forms an environment is the backdrop for individuals who reveal their characters in a tragic landscape reading the film artist s biography fellini on fellini reveals his attitude toward the auguste clown and the imperious white clown their relationships power structures and the circus as a metaphor for life itself in the film maker concludes with an acceptance of life as a circus a parade of clowns lovers friends and associates who enter the spotlight and give resolution to the film who is to argue i think life is like a circus pretty often there is the reality of being in the circus and behind the illusions and there is the reality of being an observor and outside flip this into any social situation and watch it fit we develop compassion and sympathy for the main characters giulietta massina is luminous as the female protagonist clown a kind of auguste figure according to fellini s own breakdown of character types she is the butt of jokes is the lost soul the sidekick to the white clown and the hapless confused child anthony quinn is oh so dark as zampano the strongman a kind of white clown authority figure who blusters bosses bullies and frightens in the end of the film a man cries at the edge of the sea he is broken lost has betrayed the trust of an innocent has little reason to believe his own soul may be saved except for the fact that his tears are falling his recognition of the sanctity of life comes late

0,i ordered this product expecting at least a pound of candy there is no information on the bag to tell you the amount you are getting but it is not near a pound each jelly bean is separately wrapped to make it look like more and when you get in at them they do not taste good you are probably used to jelly bellies but these are not jelly bellies there flavor is medium at best i would not buy this product again
0,i asked my sister to buy this bike for my daughter for xmas last year she decided to buy another one for my nephew also since he is the same age as my daughter yrs old at the time she bought the two bikes at the same time same model same color same store my daughter who is far more coordinated then my nephew tips over very easy my nephew seems to do fine my daughter is taller and that may be where the difference lies perhaps the height of the child using the trike is what is causing the trike to tip easily not sure but i know i regret that she ever got the bike it was a total waste of money

1,r type final introduction over the years irem s r type series has been one of the finest side scrolling space shooter series out there from its dawn in the eighties to the modern age the series has always pleased its fans serving up its share of uniqueness and challenges alike many installments of the series have graced a number of gaming consoles and arcades alike in the series finally hit the big consoles of the era the playstation two was the only gaming system that was fortunate enough to receive r type final how did this new modernized version of the series fare read on and find out overview r type final was released for the playstation two gaming console in early the game features a number of different gameplay modes configurations vehicles and other variables to keep things interesting the game is a product of the irem corporation review i have always loved the r type series and i was ecstatic to hear that the series was finally getting the next generation console treatment and after finally giving the game a whirl i must say for the most part i am impressed the game stays true to its roots while at the same time incorporating just enough new elements to make the experience fresh let s see where this game succeeds and where it falls flat the good classic style r type gameplay if you ve played any other game in this series you ll pick this one up right away the game plays similar in style to its predecessors and as such is very easy to learn if you ve played any other game the series has to offer lots of new elements thrown into the experience when you start the game you ll have your choice of three ships but you can unlock more there are over a hundred ships total the game also features plenty of new weaponry and power up items if you play the game heavily it s going to reward you well challenging if you re looking for a challenge you ve come to the right place this game serves up its fair share of challenging elements and it never lets up even game masters will be challenged controls are easy to learn and effective if you played any installment of the series on the super nintendo you ll have a pretty good idea of what to expect from this control scheme the bad despite all the improvements it s still the same game even though i like all the improvements this game has made to the series at heart it s still the same game we played in arcades and on lesser consoles years ago if you didn t like the series then this new installment isn t going to change your mind no immediate regeneration when killed this has always been a huge flaw of this series and i am disappointed to see that this wasn t fixed in most space shooters you regenerate immediately after you die right where you died not the case with this series graphics aren t that great for a next generation game granted the gameplay is the most important thing here but still i think they could have done a little better with all of the hardware available overall despite the obvious issues this is one of the best versions of r type i have played to date if you re a big time fan of this series this installment is well worth checking out if you re not a fan though this one isn t going to change your mind still if you are one of the many r type fans out there don t hesitate to give this one a whirl edition notes this game it seems wasn t produced for a very lengthy period of time as such it seems to be rather difficult to come by you re probably going to have to order it online or check around in used game stores this one is tough to come by new
0,like many others my perfume turned yellow as well i think it only happens with the atomizer perhaps exposure to air soured the perfume i am throwing it away as soon as possible because it no longer smells good the product was bought for me as a gift and it came in a huge set i am disappointed and sad that my friend spent about dollars for a cheap product with a short shelf life i am never buying perfume from britney spears obviously the makers of the perfume did not perform enough quality control tests before releasing the perfume

1,xenosaga episode took us in although the flaws in that game were many the story was sufficiently entertaining and interesting to warrant the praise that was given to the game and the clunky play mechanics xenosaga episode was awful plain and simple it was awful any of the interesting cliff hangers from episode were either answered stupidly or not at all the game not only possessed a lackluster storyline with extra characters introduced merely for confusion s sake but i have never seen a battle system more user unfriendly and more monotonous and clunky than that of episode at times i wanted to throw my against the wall particularly when fighting the patriarch a terrible game which seemed to kill the series until episode which is a throwback to simpler rpg fare and works quite well in episode the battles are actually interesting to fight at least early on i enjoy the use of the boost counter for once no more will you guess at whether shion s attack is useful against enemy a or whether you should switch to say chaos instead characters are divided into three classes attackers defenders and supporters healers it s a pretty simple system no also the story kicks back into high gear i won t spoil anything except to say that finally the testaments which were alluded to in episode but completely ignored other than tangential referral in episode have returned and let s face it wilhelm is a much more compelling character than say a young albedo finally the wheels which began spinning in episode come full circle in fact it seems as if episode could have been skipped entirely with no loss of continuity there are numerous nods to xenogears in this game and by the way the gear sequences are actually quite fun the character battles in episode two were only trumped in boredom by the gear battles in any case xenosaga is a worthy addition to the library it has flaws again it would be nice to have action sequences and movie sequences move more seamlessly although it s infinitely better than episode or but it s a fun game

1,this was the first punk o rama cd i listened to and boy i was not dissapointed most of the songs on this cd are the type of punk i would listen to quite fast and energetic the best song on the cd has to be either nofx bath of least resistance nofx being the greatest punk band of all time of course or beatsteaks let me in i heard the beatsteaks for the first time on this cd and there absolutely bloody excellent obviously the cd is made complete with songs from the descendents pulley pennywise dropkick murphy s the only let down on this cd is noise conspiracy there song on this cd well plainly sucks i m sorry to say but overall this cd is one hell of a good listen if your into punk that s all oh yeah buy it by
1,attell is one of the few decent comics out there right now i wasn t that big of a fan until i saw this in a record store and decided to give it a shot i m running out of comedy albums there s not that many good ones out there so i bought it and i was impressed the audience is obviously drunken college kids who were very familiar with the show insomniac they would laugh and scream if just slammed the microphone into his forehead the whole night he has very good timing and delivery though and his jokes have very unpredictable punchlines for the first time you are hearing them you never see the punchline coming a mile away he is vulgar so if you are sensitive in any way to graphic sexual scenarios and profanity stay away he is one of the few that i enjoy now tragically mitch hedberg died in march because he was another the increasingly popular dane cook doesn t do it for me cook s retaliation cd has broken all sorts of records for a comedy album i think cook is very marketable to the college crowd guys like him because he s the loud obnoxious drinking buddy from the frat chicks think he s cute i recommomend attell myself he is vulgar but is just a better comedian
0,terrible follow up to the first movie this movie does not hold a candle to the first classic movie staring john travolta and olivia newton john the acting is bad and it is not worth the money it belongs where most grease belongs in a bucket under the sink

0,a little less psycho babble and a bit more logistical information would have suited me better ms cantrell spends the majority of the book being a relationship marriage counselor and though it s true issues become larger in smaller spaces there are more issues for women cruisers than just their relationship dynamics as i said practical logistical information would have suited me better

0,this movie is a rehash of the first but it is a crappy unconvincing emotionally uninspiring movie let me guess what part will be about a guy who looks at video or pictures goes back in time does not alter that timeline the way he wants i e always worst case scenario and ends up killing himself in the end for the sake of everyone else
1,disclaimer i am not employed by or associated in any way with the game s publisher or developer i am just another consumer i put that disclaimer because people have a tendency to point out all the positive game reviews here as planted by the developers that may be true in some cases but not here civcity rome is not without it s flaws the mouse cursor bug is a known issue on high resolution settings and the game developers have acknowledged this and will be releasing a patch soon how this slipped by their beta testers is beyond me but i ll agree with some others here it is nearly a game breaker that aside if you love things set in ancient rome like me and if you love city builder cb pc games like me you ll absolutely love civcity rome don t be fooled by the title the game has absolutely nothing to do with the civilization series of games it is more like a blend of caesar iii and simcity with a heavy influence of stronghold ii thrown into the mix i personally have spent many hours playing the game on medium difficulty and i find the interface and in game advisors extremely easy to navigate some have stated the game s interface is clunky and hard to navigate i would love to know what game they are comparing civcity rome to because the interface is slick and very easy to use graphically the game is beautiful to look at those who say the graphics are dated are living in a fantasy world just take a look at the screenshots admittedly the graphics are not as pretty as those in the upcoming caesar iv game but they are very well done especially on newer systems the tutorial and the manual were both very generous and well done the in game voice acting is charming and appropriate the gameplay is challenging and addictive and the learning curve is about what you would expect for any city builder i strongly suggest anyone interested in city building games and especially ancient rome based games to check this game out it is well worth the bucks and you ll get many hours of enjoyment if you have a high resolution monitor you may want to wait for the first patch though cheers

1,well i m just amazed this model is still in production the way things are changing so quickly in the a v world i bought mine two years ago and have recorded many hours of my children as they are growing up this is a truly low maintenance and low cost solution for your video recording needs if you don t have a lot of money to spend on a digital set up just buy and extra after market battery or two and they re cheap and some inexpensive analogue tape and start recording away after you climb the learning curve of course my one problem with this camcorder is that the controls are anything but intuitive and they re splattered all over the unit be sure to read the user manual carefully before you try to use this thing but once you ve got it down you ll find this a trusty and low cost companion for your family vacations and holidays oh yeah almost forgot the microphones aren t stereo but they re really quite good for an entry level unit

0,ok i really thought this ball would be great considering the overinflated price and since it is endorsed by the nba not so this ball feels very similar to the cheap balls you can get at your local department stores feels similar to the wilson ncaa solution game ball but slightly less tacky but since it has to be pumped up so much inorder for it to actually bounce it feels almost like rubber i personally do not like that this ball is supposed to be able to be played out of the box without a break in period well i hope it gets to feeling better over time but since it supposedly has not break in period i am very skeptical i honestly do not feel the crosstraxxion design does anything to improve the the feel or grip of the ball if you like the feel of leather this is not for you i am not impressed search for reviews for this ball before purchasing the only thing you can do with this ball that you can t do with others is say well at least this is the official game ball the pros use
1,as a classic seattle tea this tea brings back memories of hiding away from the rainy weather sipping a delicious naturally sweet cinnamon citrus tea when i drink this tea i am home again this tea has a unique personality that seems to embody the entire mood of seattle in one cup this is a delicious tea that should be brewed for at least minutes to bring out all the flavors you can sweeten this more if you like with stevia or a natural sugar to enhance the natural sweetness it is good with a touch of muscovado sugar from india tree or the rieme french vanilla syrup when i m writing reviews and i get sleepy this tea wakes me up the rebecca review
0,i was overall disappointed by this cd there are many good reviews here but they generally overpraise tracks through have too much synthesizer for my ears a major highlight is track the crab and the egret but interestingly the flute is accompaniment to the wondrous chinese percussion disappointingly the cd is only minutes long and left me wanting more tunes without synthesizer accompaniment

1,in this movie based on a true story we see jerry stahl played by ben stiller jerry is a geek hollywood scriptwriter who turns out junk for sitcoms although he thinks he is shakespeare by his admiration of his own writing jerry has it all a hollywood mansion liz hurley a cool car and yet he decides to throw it all away for some heroin jerry s heroin habit costs a week but he is only earning per week one does not need a phd in advanced mathematics to realize this this spells trouble jerry eventually gets clean with the help of maria bello and then he wrote his story in a best selling book one can only hope that his new fortune does not lure him back into the drug scene i give this sorry excuse of a movie stars because it has maria bello in it although i still can t figure out why she finds jerry the geek so interesting his story is the same as any street junkie they all look the same to me when they are injecting heroin into their veins on the street
1,i ve had this shredder for many many months now and it s performed perfectly zero issues i d highly recommend for daily at home shredding
1,why buy the upgrade when you can buy the full version basically cause it was cheap you will see old version new version and so on i just bought the old version and installed the latest update now i am up to date and for a lot less money which meant i could spend the extra cash on more software for my mac as far as performance no faster than jaguar or panther the benchmarks say faster but if you stare at the screen in any version the nano seconds you save are not noticable you will encounter drive issues at some point as this version appears to have issues more often this seems to be due to the new journaling scheme but i cannot back this up if possible i recommend you erase the drive you are installing to in the disk utility select the erase tab and then the security button select the zero out data option note you cannot erase a drive but only a volume this will clear out any corrupt data and pinpoint any bad or damaged sectors the main reason i wanted this was for the widgets they are a blessing calculator thesarus package tracking and many more tiger only comes with about a dozen widgets but in the widget configuration button you will see the more widgets option you will be directed to hundreds of others widgets for immediate and free installation my favorite is the weather and radar widget as i work outdoors a lot i am able to quickly see the latest radar and plan my week all by press no need to interupt what i am doing on the mac as the widgets will pop up in my layout and my activities stay active click any area other than a widget and they hide away if you want to wait for a version of the osx that allows you to write your own widgets without taking a programming course wait for leopard
0,when i watched requiem from the darkness i had high hopes for an anime show i heard that could actually by scary to my dissappointment this show was not scary at all but a mockery of anything that is anime this show has good animation is some spots with some deformed shapes of people the strengths of the show however primarily rely on its soundtrack which is above average but nothing amazing also the last straw with this show was the horrible depictions of people being graphically murdered this show is disgusting because of these potrayals a brothers murdering each husband killing wife after wife a man who enjoys murder and very very intense sexual situations of insects and once again family members murdering each other i recommend this show to no one and i believe geneon has made a mistake licensing it if you don t heed my review then you have wasted your money on a dvd not worth a penny i wouldn t take it for free
1,here s a secret for the uninformed this is a very popular scale with people who never weigh a single fish this is perhaps the best inexpensive package scale you can get and if you re a regular ebay seller it s one of the best tools you cna buy for making accurate weighings for estimating shipping charges with this scale and a plastic bag you can weigh any package no matter how irregularly shaped and get a weight accurate within an ounce or two but remember it s a secret
1,i bought this for my wife so she could pull out the camera turn it on and take a nice photo flash works well unlike some reviews i ve read battery life appears to be fine also this is a small light camera measuring wide tall and deep when turned off not exactly a credit card but likely as close to one as you re gonna get camera opens up instantly takes a nice photo whether with or without flash battery life appears ok and controls are easy to use either in figuring them out or using your fingers on them nice big screen by so you can easily see what s going on a nice plus this camera also has a nice reminder listing on the right of the display so you can see flash setting on off etc iso setting for those of you that use that and very nice way to access the other controls shown for the auto focus self timer antishake iso sensitivity white background am i losing you yet and so on one point to remember is that this listing is arranged from most likely to use to least likely so the user interface has been a strong consideration in the design of this camera i ve gotten some nice pictures with this with and without flash a nice pick why not stars cuz i ve also bought a more expensive digital camera that gives me more choices although for the price this camera is fine and it d be one i d buy again but it isn t the equal of dig cams with optical zooms separate iso settings and all those other techie things that frankly aren t that important to a lot of users but which do need to be considered in a rating do buy a carrying case as i have done so the camera doesn t get scratched or lost cuz it z so small i don t have any special fear about this but it s also easy to buy a small carrying case to stash this into so why not do it as in all my reviews i have no financial interest one way or the other in what i review also don t forget you are likely to want a bigger memory card to store pix and maybe a second battery to swap out when needed consider these additional costs but also consider these additional costs apply to any camera you buy

1,i recieve different magazines over the course of a year i don t know why it simply happens that way marie claire is a pleasant surprise i found in the first issue i read a group of writers editors and all involved with this magazine not just writing about issues but being proactive everyone on the street in nyc in bikinis and whatever each individual felt comfortable with to bring awareness to skin cancer really cool each issue has write ups on a certain amount of relevant international and national news for women and other sexes too they are adding the right amount of consciousness to an otherwise totally fashion magazine which also i have found surprisingly refreshing and fun ace job marie claire staff

1,timothy hart lost his b over germany in and is spending the rest of the war as a guest of the third reich in stalag luft in tuskeegee airman lincoln scott arrives in camp and is promptly accused of cutting the throat of smuggler vincent bedford the prisoners demand a trial their jailers agree and ex harvard law student hart is appointed to defend scott who appears inexplicably less than grateful in fact their german jailers are more helpful to the defense than either scott or the american officers or so it seems as scott s trial for murder progresses against a backdrop of class conflict racial hatred and world war atmospheric to the point of claustrophobia a perfectly paced plot and one of the few times i ve been completely blindsided by a novel s climax ps the film adaptation starring bruce willis is truly gagworthy stay away from it
1,these t shirts fit on the small side for women not juniors but are soft comfortable and well made i have bought
1,these cereal bars by kellogg s are the best well actually at first i wasn t that sure it s rare to see a cereal bar on the grocery shelf that actually has of your daily requirement for fiber in just one bar i was very impressed by that claim and so i brought a box home to try it out these cereal bars are tasty and quite easy to chew on when you re in need of a quick breakfast or snack that has some health quality to it they aren t that expensive either moreover there are no trans fats although there is a very very slight amount of partially hydrogenated oils in the bar these cereal bars contain some vitamins too which is always a plus however one caveat be careful if you have any allergies to wheat soy milk and or almonds stay away unless your doctor tells you it s ok to have this food highly recommended enjoy smiles
0,the fits perfectly in the case too bad the case has no strap and no belt loop apparently the camera strap is supposed to function as the case strap also too bad the camera strap is extremely short made for very small people so instead of returning it and using a generic case that would not protectthe camera as well i will adapt the case to work for me i will get a bigger aftermarket strap for the camera i can take the case to my seamstress and have a belt loop sewn on it will work but only after extensive modification great camera design so it s odd that the case appears to have been designed by someone who has never used a camera before
1,i liked this charger so much that i ended up ordering a second unit premium solid performance in addition to years warranty i called lenmar company since the fan on the second charger did not work out of the box but guess what they sent me another charger without hussle the call took about minute and the replacement part was already on its way they definetly stand by and back up their warranty no problems with the second unit and if i ever need another one i would still buy a lenmar the two middle charging slots supposed to work only on lenmar ppro h batteries one can use the slot number and for regular nimh batteries it charges regular high capacity batteries to an level in less than minutes and the other ppro h batteries in about minutes i didn t notice difference between my rechargeable energizer batteries and the the ppro h batteries but the ppro h kind are more durable this charger is the best in its category because it support worldwide voltage v and the first to use charging technology it s solid and heavy duty charger not like the cheap kind that are everywhere i went through lots of sony chargers but you know what they will never see my money again the sony chargers are crappy and fry a lot i have been using the since october almost daily and never once i had an issue with it

1,as one might suspect gta san adreas has the classic anarchist fun with insane driving guns galore and a lawless protagonist and a linear storyline let s be honest though nobody buys gta to just play the mission part and in fact i have a hard time getting into the missions in san andreas there is an even larger area of gameplay and a few other cities to explore once you have advanced in the game unless you want to cheat the clear aspect that sets this game apart from the previous ones is the depth of gameplay haircuts and tattoos are available for purchase you have various parts of your character that can be built up fat hunger muscle driving skill weapon skill etc obviously when you get fat you need to run around and eat when hungry the others are self explanatory some new and rather interesting vehicles ave been added to this game the hydra which is a harrier type jet the stunt plane an attack helicopter a four wheeler a parachute and my favorite the jetpack other than that the game is like each created before it from gta on the graphics even on a fairly modern computer still leave much to be desired whatever engine they use is clearly the same as gta animation on the other hand is very natural and realistic music from the radio stations is lackluster but i believe it is possible to use your own music instead as a computer game san adreas controls at the very least awkward because of the sheer number of actions that can be done in the worst case scenario the hydra however using a keyboard to fly the plane is downright nerveracking if you want to shoot something below you be sure to compensate by a couple of seconds not because it moves fast but because you need that time to angle the nose of the plane in that direction i myself use an xbox controller which has an adapter to use the usb port on the computer even with that it is not much better and you still need the d pad to make decent turns as you can tell this is my biggest qualm with the game overall grand theft auto san andreas has a lot to offer if you don t have a regular gaming console but that is compensated by the clumsy keyboard controls i would rate it a out of

1,i gave this monopod to my boyfriend as a gift and it s been perfect for his use he videotapes his kids s baseball and softball games and was tired of holding the camcorder for so long he didn t want to deal with a bulky tripod when he was getting up and down so a monopod seemed like a great idea he has loved it he says it keeps the camera very steady and it s very easy to change the height so he can use it sitting or standing he s no professional but he uses his camcorder a lot and he ll be happily using the monopod for a long time
1,i cannot say enough positive things about this item i absoloutely loved the fact that it helped to keep my son warm on cool nights but it was safe enough for him to use in his crib every night this item needs to be brought mainstream so that it can be available to all parents for their kids
1,i did a lot of research before buying this camera we could have bought a higher quality digital camcorder for less or higher quality minidv camcorder for the same price what led to our final decision to purchase this camcorder was the fact we could record straight to a dvd r finalize the disc on the camcorder and play it directly on our dvd player or dvd rom player on our computer we didn t want to deal with sticking cables and wires into the tv electrical outlet and camera to playback footage and we also didn t want to deal with the cost and trouble of transferring footage onto dvds to keep in our video library for the future for those of you who like to edit re record create effects etc you need to purchase special software separately but with a dvd ram disc you have the ease and convenience of doing it all from your dvd rom on your computer you can also download it with the usb cable but it is nice to be able to just pop it in the dvd drive and get started if you are only interested in playback dvd r discs are sufficient however you can t erase or record over footage on dvd rs only dvd rw and dvd ram discs the picture quality of the camera is adequate it isn t grainy but smooth and actually very nice in the right lighting especially outside on a sunny day it doesn t have a built in light so you have to be aware of the right surroundings and environment for recording i would give the picture quality a out of if you want better quality you will need to buy a more expensive dvd camcorder considering how far we have come over the years with home video technology it definitely beats those days images were out of focus and grainy you can t compare it to tv and movie camera quality but i think it is pretty darn good for home videos the zoom is good but of course it takes some time to focus if you zoom in or out too quickly the stabilizer is pretty good but i keep it off for the most part to get better picture quality if you plan to move around a lot use the function but expect to lose a little quality in the process what basically happens when using the stabilizer with most cameras i believe is that the image movements are slightly delayed the sound quality is adequate but if you are recording when it is windy you will pick up a lot of the wind sounds unless you block the microphone with your hand the only problem i have had so far is with the discs we bought panasonic dvd rw discs and can t get them to play on our computer or in our dvd player we ended up purchasing sony dvd r discs and they play with no problem when i called panasonic about their dvd rw discs they didn t have a good answer the representative told me to make sure the dvd rw discs are compatible with my players i told her they may not be compatible with my dvd player but it should be with my new computer software the representative just repeated herself and eventually said there isn t any difference between sony and panasonic discs interesting they make the claim that panasonic discs work the best in the manual but now i know better overall this camcorder is a great value you can t beat the price for this dvd technology average to good quality picture and functions is excellent for the ease and convenience of dvd playback and storage and is really easy to use
0,the personality of a nazi brownshirt was one of a heightened need for acceptance fred leuchter was painted as such by many people some who knew him and i m guessing knew better and as we may be witnessing others who didn t brownshirts insult assault rather than intellectually confront and expose objections to their popular ideas maybe a major lesson of the holocaust is that the brownshirt mentality can live in any culture so long as a popular movement of idea is available for them to cling to so long as the need for acceptance outweighs the need for a competition of ideas there must be someone to hate for the brownshirt to exist so that they may prove their allegiance to the group maybe a great contribution one can give to their group is sincere dissent as dissent does not equal disloyalty except in a nazi state there was a great free press in germany in nazi times so long as that free thought was constrained within the preset boundaries mr death is not representation of fred leuchter fred leuchter is representation of fred leuchter might i suggest not suggesting a collection of articles by many of the same people in this documentary that s not clarification that s reinforcement of one idea rather go and find fred and speak to him get his view if you don t have a preformed agenda like van pelt or morris you may get him to respond like i did i found a different fred and a much much different story than i was given by director morris and others the question is not whether german gas chambers were used to murder people the question is whether someone will be allowed to think contrary to that or any other idea that is without having his house firebombed a concerted effort to ruin him financially take place have his reputation ruined or any of the other stuff happen if fred s ordeal is any indication the brownshirts are alive and well but i don t think fred is one of them the one fact i would alter in my previous post is rabbi bauer s support for no gas chambers bauer supported fred s methods not necessarily his conclusion i tried in vain to contact bauer on where he differs with fred fred has high regard for rabbi bauer the polish forensic investigation which came soon after fred s did not come to the same conclusion as fred but did essentially duplicate fred s data collection methods and results there was testimony at the nuremburg trials by both inmates and german staff that homocidal gassings took place in those camps in germany in physical and chemical tests showed that no gassings occured there it took years for simon weisenthal to admit that no gassings took place in those german concentration camps a former inmate at auschwitz has said that no homocidal gassings took place there but all this isn t to say that the auschwitz gassings didn t occur but rather to simply say that some may think they didn t occur and for that they shouldn t be condemned unless the idea is to create an enemy out of sincere people like fred
1,i m sure that you don t need any more assurance but just to let you know i ve had my tweezerman s for over years now they are still sharp plus if you ever were to drop them they probably wouldn t be significantly damaged these tweezers are a must have
1,if you are interested in knowing what challenges monarches and other powerful people face this movie is a great beginning you may or may not be interested in russian history or even world history but this particular story greatly encapsulates the emotional physical and political issues faced by two powerfully born adults and their children other reviews at this site are terrific for their critical perceptions of this movie and its strengths and weaknesses so i will not go into too much detail to sell anybody on the action or dialogue or historical accuracy suffice to say this movie in its unedited version crucial for dvd does in fact tell it like it is or was nicholas and alexandra were two human beings who happened to be born into the western dynastic system still prevalent at the turn of the century they were responsible in an almost biblical sense for the destiny of humanity only they opted out and were then executed this would be considered romantic if humanity did not have such an overwhelming need for leadership by designated heroes the dvd version is critical to see the full relationship between alexandria and rasputin as a surrendering of power and also to see rasputin in his full decadent expression which must be positively repulsive to russian history revisionists it is also necessary in an emotional and historic context to see the failure of nicholas that he could no longer carry the responsibility of the godhead it is also relevant to see the execution of rasputin at the hands of the two hop head fairies who were also in line to inherit this godhead and that they themselves had dreams of american incorporation alexia nicholas and alexandra s only son who also happened to be a hemophiliac hates his persecutors with a very personal adult hatred those who persecuted the romanov dynasty were people who hated themselves and took that hatred out on the leaders they loved and despised they loved their leaders and despised their need for leaders if you purchase this movie whatever your reason or interest please buy the dvd so that it is unedited meaning uncensored so thatyou may judge for yourself
1,not only is we love katamari way better then the first but you get to play the prince s cousins some of the cousins are faster some are slower some seem stronger then others also some of the katamari s have earth elements such as a big snowball katamari a fireball one too the fireball is kind of tricky you have to keep the fire on it burning if not the level fails also watch out for the water it will put it out no matter how big it is last but not least to finish we love katamari you need to convert your progress from katamari damacy to this one if you did delete the first one from you memory card then to bad you ll have to play the first all over again

0,if you have not read the book then this movie may intrigue you it is quirky and interesting to say the least as a storyline it does not lack imagination from maine to vienna to nyc and back to maine from the jew hating german tourists to the radicals and the from one hotel new hampshire to another the dreams of a father and his colourful family unfold in a series of bizarre and at times disturbing events and life appears to be a fairy tale that we live as we chase our dreams now in relation to the actual book this movie can be described with just one word rushed the adaptation is so faithful that it tries to cover almost everything all characters and all events thereby failing miserably to project the sentiment behind the eccentric story of this highly unusual family i could go on and on about how the accurate quotes from the original text fall flat on a screenplay that comes across truncated and patched together clumsily how the scenes lack emotional depth how the characters are not given enough time to be adequately developed but i will instead characterise the whole attempt as noble but short if the book was a long wave like function with a rise to a crest then a drop followed by a building surge and another rise to another crest over and over and over again then the movie was just a cross section of the top parts of this rollercoaster of a wave like function shaving off all the crests and placing them in a two hour blender where they were shaken and served to please god knows what surely not the potential of this fascinatingly bizarre book nor its undercurrent and extremely subtle magical tone and it was not for lack of effort it was for lack of realism on how to put on screen a highly bizzare story in a way that flows smoothly rather than jump spastically between scenes a mini series would have worked much better for such a faithful adaptation either that or a more free flowing interpretation that could possibly make sense within the minutes that are usually allocated to a motion picture thank god for jodie foster s and beau bridges s performances who bring fanny and win berry to life keep passing the open windows and read the book for a much richer and meaningful experience as far as this movie is concerned just toss it out as far as you can and if you are to keep it then do so to remind yourselves of how to not adapt a great book onto the screen this is the only reason why i keep mine
1,the nephews loved it we sent it to them along with other gifts for christmas turns out the twin year olds found this to be their favorite gift the light up part was pretty cool but they did have some trouble bouncing the ball when the lights went out the fun really happened everything went well even when it turned into tackle basketball not their mom s favorite sport but no harm no foul

0,this dog looked so cute and fun in the commercials and it was the one of only two things my year old really asked santa for come christmas morning today i open it and put the batteries in and all it did was whine and we were petting the head and chest hard after about minutes i did get it to bark then another minutes later i got the tail to wag but the leg wouldn t shake for another minutes minutes of trying to get it to do any thing at all it finally licked but the tongue was not wet and i did put water in it so it should have been wet then my daughter got mad because she couldn t get it to lick again the dog doesn t even stand up like it appears to be doing on the box it just lays there if you are buying this be prepared to be paying for a highly priced stuffed animal because that is all it amounts to i can t believe a manufacturer would put some thing like this out there so that kids can be disappointed on christmas morning this product should have just plainly been recalled
1,the real life base dr li ching yun adds to the wonder and mystery many movies usually pale compared to the book however this movie fits all the criteria of a great classic such as excellent film footage for the time even though some scenes are missing when i look at the shangri la setting some times my mind wanders and i wonder if this was the idea behind the valley in the book atlas shrugged by ayn rand i doubt that they could have picked any better actors for the parts these actors fit the time and surroundings and were actually believable in the characters they played a later remake of this movie was o k but just did not have the presence of these actors now the dvd features digitally remastered audio anamorphic video production notes restoration before and after comparison three deleted scenes photo documentary with narration by historian kendall miller many more by the way i personally enjoy watching and re watching this movie

1,i ve always loved victorinox swiss army knives but i must admit that i when i purchased this one i was not sure if i made the right choice but my expectations were soon exceeded it was right before a trip to the boundary waters canoe area wilderness in minnesota i had lost my other swiss army knife a tinker and i was looking for a versatile knife with a locking blade i did not need dozens of other tools for my pending stay in the wilderness i settled on this one because it was on sale and i have not been disappointed the handle has a mild contour that made it very comfortable to handle for its size it had just the right heft but it was not too heavy to weigh down my shirt where i kept it in my buttoned breast pocket the locking blade worked wonderfully i could close it with either one or two hands when closing it the blade pauses at the halfway point reducing the risk of closing it on your fingers when closing it one handed that said it does not eliminate all risk so close the knife with one hand at your own risk during my recent canoe trip i lost my fillet knife on a portage trail and was surprised that cleaning a northern pike with this blade was quite painless though it did take some skill beyond the blade i ve always found the leather awl and the screwdriver handy but the can opener blade is a primary reason why i prefer victorinox swiss army knives over those produced by wegner the knife shipped in a simple cardboard box a sheath or pouch would have been nice but i was able to fabricate one with duct tape before my trip since i kept it in my shirt pocket for most of my trip the sheath wasn t necessary but it is one accessory you should consider purchasing if you choose this knife i recommend getting one you will not be disappointed

0,several years ago i used delorme s street atlas with a usb gps receiver the software worked but the interface was lousy this year i tried microsoft s streets and trips and was surprised to find that it has an interface that is smoother in some ways than the delorme software but still surprisingly clumsy and the help is possibly the worst i have seen in a microsoft product that s saying a lot here are some of the problems street trips is expecting a gps receiver that uses a com port are you kidding me in the delorme earthmate usb will work if you use the delorme com port emulation software but why is this necessary and it was not trivial to get it to work the handling of pushpins identifying spots on the map favorite places and the like is extremely clumsy although contrary to another review you don t to re enter the information each time you just save the file and reload it directions are sometimes not so great why would you instruct someone to turn left if you don t know which direction they re pointing e g when you re stationary in a parking lot much better in such cases to say head ne or some such freeway exits at least in so california were often not handled well one freeway entrance was identified as a local road which at the time proved quite confusing why doesn t the software automatically recalculate directions to put you on route once you re off route you can push but why is this necessary i never got the voice providing driving guidance to work the online help was useless i m sure someone can jump in and tell me how to do it but it should be trivial in general the software has the feel of a bunch of modules written independently and thrown together i m not a reflexive anti microsoft bigot i bought this software after all but i find that much ms software is bad precisely because it feels like it s cobbled together without much attention given to integration it s shiny on the surface but the shine vanishes once you really start to use it given this experience i will probably give the delorme software another try next time around
1,no wonder this is a bestseller the results are highly visible and real fast i noticed a change in my skin s pigmentation just a few days after using it highly effective i recommend it to anyone looking for a good quality product and tired of just fancy labels and marketing

1,new york magazine is the flag bearer for new york is the center of the universe belief it meets this goal in dishing up news gossip reviews and viewpoints on a weekly basis how else can one get away with call shopping strategy the magazine succeeds because behind the snobbery example an article on the best cities in the world it turns up the restaurants stories and culture that make nyc such a fantabulous place it s worth diminishes rapidly though the further one gets from the big apple
1,i purchased this gps back in april of and have been very happy with it since it is not perfect but you have to remember that this is not a dedicated street navigator or hicker gps it s a hybrid of the two and with that there are compromises in the car it is accurate and maps routes quickly of the time the other of the time it either looses signal has outdated maps my update is ordered and on it s way as i type or just slow processing for some reason of this of the time i d say only of the time has this been an actual problem for me the rest of the time i was able to simply guess what i needed to do next or it didn t matter at all i have not found a perfect way of fixing the slow route calcuations but the vast majority of the time this hasn t been an issue on foot one of the features that sold me on this was the fact that it had a long lasting battery and it was waterproof both qualities needed to be used for hiking the only catch is you have to turn off the lock to roads otherwise you will get some really confusing directions also it is difficult to program in destinations by coordinates as opposed to addresses but it can be done put in and address then change everything including the coordinates in the confirmation screen before hitting route on boat haven t tested this as i don t have a boat and haven t purchased the water based maps overall i m very happy with this and looking forward to the map update i wish it was a little faster on route calculating and map drawing and that it was easier to imput exact coordinate points it s still better than buying lugging around seperate gps systems to me
1,this case is superior it attaches easily and i especially like the screen cover most cases don t have this if you drop the phone and crack the screen you re hosed the only thing that kept me from giving stars is the belt clip it s bulky and impractical just a simple tension clip would have been fine
0,the schumann that is presented here is a forgery don t get me wrong i m not railing against schumann at all the question here is what makes schumann great and the way that bernstein presents these symphonies says schumann is great for the wrong reasons the real schumann that lived was a completely different person than what we might assume from listening to this particular presentation of his music schumann was not a hopeless romantic he was one composer in a long line of classicists which ended with brahms yet at the same time he was an innovator pushing forward trying to find new stylistic and technical means of expression he had plenty of dignity and he didn t write his music as a desperate plea for the world to like him which is exactly what it sounds like here bernstein trudges through these fine works as if he were dying yes many of these performances are the slowest on record but this is a bad thing these beautiful works lose value immeasurably when they are saturated with thick waxy overly romantic textures and phrasing tell me did schumann ever write to be played extremely histrionically and melodramatically with the greatest possible amount of cheese and theatrics in his score no he did not these performances are not more expressive than others in the real sense of the word and any person in his her right mind should be able to see this you may be able to hear the orchestration more clearly than in karajan s filth but that s not saying much at all and for this slight favor bernstein does for the music he makes it infinitely worse when he stretches the fabric of these works beyond their limit the most blatant example is the third movement of the second symphony taken at half tempo all semblance of melody and motion is lost this movement is supposed to be several minutes shorter than the first and not the longest movement of the symphony not to mention the longest movement in the entire set in fact almost every movement of every symphony could stand to have at least a minute hacked off of its timing also while looking at the scores you might notice that bernstein does away with detail work this time around carefully laid out phrasing and the dynamic arch are thrown out of the window in favor of grand romantic gestures observing details in schumann ironically helps to make the music speak more freely and honestly this isn t honest music making here only a self indulgent conductor once again plastering his image over the face of great art

1,i ve been a virgin mobile customer for a few years now and have to agree with an earlier reviewer if you want a phone phone without all the extra hoopla this isn t a bad deal i bought a red slice a couple of weeks ago take note that i m not one of those people with a cell phone perpetually growing out of one ear and for my needs emergencies quick calls to family from the grocery store it s just right good points i got mine for free with reward zone points at best buy fits into a small purse or pocket easily nice looking someone mistook it for a chocolate the other day clear reception long distance calls are just as crystal as local not sure if this is an area thing but apparently the service in and around chicago s solid pay as you go option works well for someone who doesn t spend a lot of time on the phone my slice holds a charge just fine i ve noticed other reviewers have said this is a problem but so far so good and doesn t heat up as someone else mentioned maybe that reviewer s got a defective phone or battery not so good points it s so slim my husband has bet me i ll lose the phone within a couple of months could be easy to misplace if you keep stacks of papers and books on your desk someone else mentioned the odd graphics hot dog dripping blue sauce some sort of pipe looking cartoons with teeth seriously i have no idea what those things might be but i say it s workable if you have a sense of humor yes the buttons are small i have small hands slender fingers and i still manage to bump the whenever i m trying to shut off the phone sometimes it s difficult to turn on the button doesn t always respond when i push it though could be i m a wimp but once it s on it s fine i m thinking this will get broken in with more use all in all it s not a bad phone beautiful red i find myself staring at it just to appreciate its beauty phone confessions i m satisfied with mine and since i haven t forked out hundreds of dollars or any dollars really i won t feel too guilty when if i do manage to lose it under a pile of paperwork

0,i bought this product mainly because my daughter has fair sensitive skin which most facial wipes cause her minor irritation this product worked very well as far as thoroughly cleaning her face hands etc it did not irritate her skin at all the problem the one and only problem is the fragrance if you can call it that it stinks so bad i did not want to go near her after i wiped her down i had to give her a bath it was so bad
1,this is a great laser pointer and the brighter wavelength of the green laser makes a huge difference but to see the beam not just the dot at the end of the beam you need some sort of particles in the air for the light to bounce off of using the laser pointer with a little dust or mist in the air will make the beam clearly stand out and if you are wondering no matter how bright your laser is without particles in the air you wont see the beam at concerts where they use the big argon lasers they always have fog machines near them to give give the laser something to bounce its light off of
0,i have had to set up a few new installs of the vista business on some servers and i was disappointed with the overall performance my biggest gripe is when i tried to remotely log in from another pc and i sat there waiting and waiting only to discover that the vista default setup is to ask permission to run even the most basic operations and was actually sitting there waiting for someone to click yes to allow the process to run how irritating kinda self defeats the idea of remotely logging in doesn t it also if you happen to rename the administrator account the change is not registered somewhere in the remote connections authorization so when i thought i was remotely logging in under the new admin account name vista wouldn t let me in and it was only after searching for what seemed an eternity some hidden place it took me minutes to find i discovered that the the new admin account name had not been authorized when i did the name change yikes for those who need to run vnc server on vista be aware there are issues installing and running that you will need to work around as well it seems like microsft drastically changed the menus overdid the default security features and installed a new hood ornament other than that i don t see what the big deal is
0,overall not terribly happy with this units user interface and design the spartan instructions require pressing buttons referred to in the manual as etc but they are not labeled as such on the device you toggle through modes that are abreviated on the display with just letters to tell you what they are tr ch what just an unfreindly interface all around look for a better unit

1,so far this is the best thickening mascara i have tried that are either sold in drug stores or at department stores it is not sticky or gloppy and you won t look like tammy fay with spider lashes i do however have to apply two coats to bring out the more sparse areas of my lashes but i have finally stopped my search for thickening mascaras my journey ends here

1,if you love baths but simply must have bubbles then the bubble bars can be a lovely addition to a salt soak you can also add one of these or half of a bubble bar along with one of the bath bombs i keep buying the bath bombs and giving them away as gifts which is an excuse to buy more lush products i ve tried numerous bubble bath products and these seem to produce an especially fun amount of bubbles you can literally hide below the bubbles there are so many you also get the added benefit of more essential oils with lush products you may have to get a journal just for bath bliss experiences there are certain products you can blend together to create moods and moments the rebecca revie
0,i bought this thinking it would work on public restrooms larger toilets for my toddler and it doesn t fit at all if you are using just for home sized potties it is fine except it heaves a little in the center but don t get it for travel as it doesn t work for that
0,we too had problems with turning the sterilizer on the unit would not turn on when the lever was pressed but several presses got it to work a couple of times after about uses it died completely not sure what the hard part about making a hotplate that is switched on by depressing a lever like an electric kettle is exactly but these guys found it this unit also left a lot of condensation in the stuff we sterilized
1,i absolutely love this suit my only downfall is it runs big so order one size down
0,i m very disappointed with this gift basket the contents that i received were far less than as pictured and described in the web page the price of is very expensive for this item and definitely not worth it i ordered items from wine country gift baskets totalling over and had to return all items due to unsatisfactory products contents i spent almost in shipping charges which they refused to reimburse me i would never order or recommend wine country gift basket to anyone
0,call me a traditionalist but i prefer the original jam filled pop tarts with none of the overly sweet frosting on top as a child i liked it right out of the toaster and would take it with me on the way to school this portable variation seems to me like a misstep from the outset the moment i ripped open the flimsy packaging the go tart bar crumbled out of my hand and onto the floor apparently the manufacturers at kellogg s decided to use the same bread like consistency they use for their standard pop tarts on this bar especially with the shipping aspect introduced by amazon i think this is a mistake since i assume the whole idea behind this iteration of the snack is the portability aspect on top of the bar is the same execrable sprinkle laden white frosting i avoided once it was introduced as an enhancement so many years ago without the ability of toasting the bar i find little point to the frosting except as a purposeless sugar rush consequently i cannot agree with its description as a ready to eat bar one bar a little over an ounce is calories thirty of which are fat even though there are more fattening bars you could eat it still has an excessive sounding mg of sodium i only tried the frosted strawberry variation because it was part of a free promotional package i received from amazon to promote their new non perishable grocery line i think i ll just stick with a granola bar if i get the kind of munchies this bar is targeted to satisfy
0,i m good with computers and have used other architectural software and this was most disappointing in fact if i had not bought this on amazon i would have returned it to the local retail store with huge complaints it was difficult to install buggy it had problems rendering a drawing and would often lock up the objects that you pull from its library can sometimes be opened and resized and sometimes cannot hardly intuitive at all also disappointing was the way multiple stories did not synch up i had reasonable expectations for this software but wish i had bought something else for it would be a good purchase for anything over that you are wasting your money try another product a demo first or something but in my opinion this was a big waste of money
1,the styling on this watch is very nice the silver and the grey colors look really good the lightweight titanium is great and the size is just right now for what i don t like about it first after purchasing online i took it to a jewelry store to have a couple of links taken out i m out for that the the clasp pin has broken twice another for repair and the watch is loud when i m driving to work or am sitting in the office and everything is quiet i can hear the ticking i don t guess that should bother me but it does
1,full flavored and smooth lingering winey aftertastes never bitter tolerates higher concentrations very well actually enhancing body and complexity of flavors those who are unfamiliar with bean coffee should be reminded to use about more by volume to get the same amount by weight as with pre ground coffees

1,just weeks ago i came here looking at reviews for the tony little s gazelle freestyle and read mixed reviews however most were encouraging and i thought it sounded like the thing for me i have now used the gazelle for less than weeks and have already seen results this is no lie i lost inches in the waist in the hips in the abdomin and in the thighs i m just as freaked as you may be but i m telling you this is the honest truth i was discouraged that i had not been seeing any results on the scales lately and needed to change things up so i d see something move again this gazelle did it for me at this time i m only up to minutes a day and miles i m still a work in progress but these results are no lie just think how much results i ll see when i can stay on longer they advertise it as a low impact overall machine and it truly is i have rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia so i was looking for something i could do that wouldn t hurt me i can honestly say i get a full workout on this machine oh i forgot to mention also inch in the arms so that s a total of inches in weeks this is the best machine i ve ever used we also have an exercise bike and ab lounge which i ve not used in the last weeks at all cause i was getting such a good workout on the gazelle and i m so happy i found it and i thank you people users of amazon com for coming here and posting your reviews and making it easy on me to know which machine to buy mine is the exact picture above and folds up i also love that feature it s not a problem to just fold it up and lean it against the wall beside my bed after each use therefore i ve still got lots of walking space beside my bed
1,there are probably more authentic ways to make real bbq but nothing any easier if what you like about bbq is the flavor not the work this unit is for you add water to the pan chips to holder put some dry rubbed pork on one or all of the four grates light the gas and you are good to go it holds temperature very well unattended adding more chips two additional times gives you all the smoke flavor you could want your friends will think you are a genius

1,overall a nice product powerful good looking but with a few quirks feed auto on mechanism a little picky as to the angle that you insert your paper recommend putting entire unit in a big trash bag when emptying otherwise shredded bits go flying to the floor make sure to put the lid on the basket in proper orientation or motor won t run look for the little metal rail on the inside top right of the basket if it s not there rotate the basket degrees and then put the top on
0,these diamonds shouldn t be offered in this size for jewelry the imperfections in them seriously hinder the sparkling characteristics a diamond is known for great price but you get what you pay for
0,lasts only weeks try them if you don t believe me
0,admittedly i am slightly older than the relevant demographic but i m not yet so there are a number of things here that do have some appeal to me and i applaud the magazine for attempting to address culturally important issues still the magazine suffers from it s unrelenting fawning over the whole post modern vibe and it s own sense of self importance as a beacon for charismatic hipness hey look out world we jesus freaks have ipods too usually the more something or someone sweats to proclaim their own relevance the more danger there is that they can become irrelevant so like it s spiritual cousin charisma this magazine suffers from a somewhat shallow perspective on life and culture it trumpets its ability to ask the tough questions even as it follows a relatively safe politically correct post mod charismatic hipster wannabe party line i mean their idea of being cutting edge was to put bono on the cover if you want to be cutting edge put the libertine adam clayton on the cover and ask him about bono s faith now i would read that article i am a major and bono fan i m not knocking him just the lack of imagination at relevant there s also way too much emulation of the world s perspective on generational heritage hey we re young and we re smart and we don t need to do anything the way our geezer parents did it i guess having a little gray hair or wrinkles doesn t cut it in today s paris hilton culture but i d like to think that it might be a little different in a culture shaped by biblical values actually relevant seems to be a little afraid to say what biblical values are beyond the obvious politically expedient ones it all seems amorphous here i ve never been a fan of the whole what s hot what s not ethos and i d like to give a little more respect to today s christian young people to think they could handle something that didn t fall into that same faddish trap i am hopeful that they may get it right yet with relevant at times they seem tantilizingly close but it takes more than a slick hairdo male earrings chin stubble idolization of youth culture icon quotations and psycobabble cool dude theological lingo to make one relevant
0,i bought this for my daughter while i was still pregnant thinking that it would be helpful thru the first few months as well as later in terms of being able to keep up with my daily chores and my y o son it certainly wasn t cheap so i assumed that it would be a good product and appeared to be safe and comfortable for younger infants don t let the product description fool you just as it says in some of the other reviews it is very possible for your child to fall when in this sling because of it s crappy strap tightener my daughter was a small newborn only weighing at nearly months which was the first time i tried using the sling and even being that small for the minutes i had the sling on i could already tell that the strap was starting to loosen definitely not safe aside from that this item is so big and bulky that i literally could not even see my daughter in it i might as well have just put a duffel bag over my shoulder and plopped her into it there wouldn t have been much difference between the two i would strongly advise that you do not purchase this product i want to get rid of mine since it s brand new but i threw away the box so i can t return it and i absolutely cannot in good concience sell it to anyone else for their child so i have no choice but to just bite my tongue and throw the product in the trash don t make the same mistake i did
1,if you are not a literature professor or don t read everything that the library gets in you will probably find this game extremely difficult on the other hand you now have a book list
0,i usually love the first years products i already had the fisher price healthy care booster seat and loved it i wanted to leave that one at my parents and have one to travel with so i thought i d try this one i was expecting to love the swing feature it was the one thing i thought was missing out on the fisher price one well i returned this chair w in hours and bought a second fisher price one here are the reasons why the base of the chair is hollow and wobbly it is also very wide and didn t comfortably fit across a normal kitchen chair you have to attach the straps yourself when purchased and they are also too wide at their tightest level they were still way too loose to be secure thought the swing out feature would be great but when the tray swings out and then you wipe baby s hands as you re putting your hands under his pits to lift him off he s already got his hands in the leftover mess on the tray the back of the chair comes off every time you fold it down you have to take the chair apart to adjust the level and when folded up it s not as compact and portable as fisher price s model do yourself a favor and splurge the extra for the healthy care booster seat
0,i reviewed the subtle subversiveness of the sinatra version in an earlier issue how does the update stand up well once they moved the setting to iraq cleaned up the muddy surrealism sobered up the star and played it straight there was absolutely no subtlety whatsoever to the political message like dropping a bowling ball on a birthday cake or chinese cinema we will tell you what to think the locals might mistake it for a documentary i quit watching after minutes you just can t carry an entire movie with a fake war hero via hypnosis plot no movie should hinge on a single plot point and if it does please don t make it a boring one no disrespect to denzel washington intended he played frank sinatra so well that co producer tina sinatra probably got goosebumps and what a waste of meryl streep she did a great job and it didn t matter but hey one of the beauties of watching dvds in china is that i don t blow three hours pay on each movie as a brief aside show one flew over the cuckoo s nest to chinese students this film refuses to tell them what to think and that confuses the hell out of them then they ask you mr teacher person to explain the film s message um it s about your school but i m not saying that
1,i got tiger to improve the working of my powerbook my jaguar installation was getting pokey after two years and a clean install with tiger cleared out the annoying slowdowns in my computer before tiger my computer would hang when playing large dv files such as the ones i made in imovie but now they run without a hitch even though the hardware is the same this tiger upgrade doesn t include some of the apps games quicken etc that my wife has on her new macbook but it did include a day trial verion of iworks which has come in handy
0,i love toeless hosiery but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose i have ever worn if i m sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly and it gets worse when i stand these are awful i can t stand it the only good things i can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose i have worn in the past the toe thong does not bind and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone but it is so not worth the itching also they run rather large the material doesn t have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees i m only feet tall but out over lbs and the smallest size is still too big i ll give hue s a try and i might even spring for the donna karan toeless panythose but i won t get these ones again
0,i have to say i am disappointed having used a trimmer from wahl with same model number which i felt gave me a good trim i immediately sought out to buy same model off amazon the one i received was much cheaper in quality the plastic guide is cheap junk which felt like it would break eventually which it did within weeks from being dropped the guide shattered there is no replacement for the position guide for the i can find now i am torn between buying another of these and treating it like a precious heirloom or finding a razor that can survive real world use on the plus side the battery life on this razor is incredible
0,the shipping was very slow and the product really isn t worth with shipping for an oz jar the product goes on like lubriderm where it feels like you are just smearing water on your skin then it starts to feel a little oily but once you get dressed your skin just feel like you have powder all over skin overall it was just ok but it ended up not being what i expected or wanted i was looking for a really good long lasting moisturizer

1,this product is truly amazing the application method can be a bit tricky and the performance varies depending on the type of mascara you use but if you follow the directions and find a good mascara formula then you will have long long lashes my lashes are medium length but when i use this people who know me thing i am wearing falsies this stuff rocks i ve never been able to find a mascara that can do what this does

1,i get the sense that the fleetwoods body of recorded work isn t given the respect it deserves over the course of their career the trio recorded thirteen albums and yet this collection as good as it is is pretty much all that s out there on cd save for a few other compilations that cover much of the same ground rock and roll has always had a soft side and it s in this area that the fleetwoods really shine their cover of thomas wayne s tragedy is an evocative slice of teen angst i can t put it any other way maybe that s the reason why the fleetwoods are given short shrift today they re the perfect embodiment of a then nascent teen culture s soft and gentle side this collection features all of their hits some well chosen album tracks and the original pre overdub version of come softly to me if you like this recording try looking for their original lps my personal favourite is the goodnight my love album
0,following orson welles fascinating yet tantalizing career can be frustrating for the aficionado so much of his oeuvre remains hidden from view that each discovery from the archives is greeted with an inordinate amount of enthusiasm take this intriguing yet relatively disappointing collection of documentaries welles directed for british tv in the the missing link in welles work exults the snapcase boilerplate this is a bit of an overstatement given that far more significant works haven t seen the light of day don quixote and the other side of the wind to name a couple the documentaries do help to fill the gap in welles output for the a decade in which he directed only three feature films around the world is a good quality dvd and unquestionably the work of welles but a ultimately a shadow of what he was capable of the five episodes on this dvd explore various aspects of european culture welles takes his camera in search of basque country spanish bullfights the idiosyncratic denizens of paris st germain des pres and the loquacious and venerable chelsea pensioners the st germain des pres episode best typifies the offbeat subject matter welles spends most of his time interviewing a commune dweller who makes his own clothes after that welles dashes through the town capturing glimpses of celebrities like jean cocteau and eddie constantine lemmy caution before discovering a group of letterists who are dedicated to you guessed it inventing new letters unfortunately welles typically low budget and the nature of the subject matter limit his range of cinematic expression despite the exotic and obscure locales most of the footage consists of relatively static interviews captured in long takes with obligatory reaction shots of welles inserted to break up the monotony even the bullfight episode lacks the dynamic footage one might expect welles camera is grounded in the stands preventing him from getting involved in the action only towards the end of st germain des pres and in the second basque episode does welles get inventive developing the active swirling camera style he employed in films like mr arkadin like a record that s worth owning for one or two songs around the world with orson welles does have one episode that justifies its purchase the second basque episode true the first few minutes repeat the introduction from the first basque show but after that welles has a lot of fun interviewing kids playing pelote a game similar to jai alai welles gets his camera into the pelote action and seems rejuvenated by the subject matter an year old boy joins welles and acts as a tour guide for the rest of the show the episode ends dramatically with welles quoting a basque aphorism against a night sky lit by fireworks for a better example of welles creativity in the documentary genre check out his essay film f for fake just released on dvd around the world with orson welles is a far more pedestrian effort but it does give welles fans something to look at while they await the more significant releases that are hopefully on the not too distant horizon
0,bad bad bad bad acting bad writing bad directing i was sort of neutral about dicaprio until i saw this steaming pile of bad acting consequently since seeing this i haven t voluntarily watched another dicaprio performance it was a huge mistake by the director or the screen writer to not set this in the era in which jim carroll grew up or if it was meant to be it failed astoundingly with glaring anachronisms
1,i love these my son loves these you would think there wouldn t be a problem but he sucks on them as they melt his hands get sticky and then the furniture or toys he touches gets sticky also but they are so yumm fyi g of sugar healthier cereal have g so i guess it isn t so bad

1,my daughters ages and were given these dolls for christmas they love them and play with them every day especially the year old i think the littlest one may be a little too young to really enjoy her fully but she plays with her when her big sister plays with hers i m glad i didn t let some of the reviews discourage me from getting these all the problems people are having with the limited english can be very easily remedied if they read the directions fully first of all you must switch the doll from display mode by moving the little switch on her back the doll comes in the mode used so that people can try her out in the store in this mode she will only say one or two things in english one you move the switch you just have to wake her up and hold the button util she s speaking english from that point on she should speak english even after waking up however if you turn her completely off via the back switch you will have to switch her back to english by holding the bracelet down i really have not had a problem and certainly don t have to spend time interpreting what she s saying that s why they make directions it tells about the display mode right on the front
1,i was a loyal reader for many years and i ve always been very impressed by their insightful deep investigations into various scandals and national political events they always knew more than the newspapers they ve been just excellent very well written and i always felt like they could back up their opinions and their open and earnest political biases right to the level of abstraction so to speak their pursuit of the objective truth whether their target has been bush or the dnc has earned my respect the new republic kept investigating and muckracking while over the last decade major news institutions have one by one become purveyors of infotainment and pre digested pablum my sense is that with media consolidation and various new press liability laws news sources have become air tight and we ve been getting our news from company pr flacks and lobbyist firms with agendas in this environment the real investigative work becomes like gold middle brow types read time but the writers at time and others who want real knowledge and context on what is happening on the ground all read the new republic the magazine has been vastly more influential than it s circulation s would imply but the new republic was for the war in iraq despite their natural antipathy towards bush which i share i haven t read them lately i m sure they re appalled at how things have gone over there the magazine has never been a cluster of soft peaceniks usually associated with the left but here i feel like they ve let loose their inner hawks given bush the benefit of the doubt always the wrong decision so what does that make them quasi neocons utopians dupes they re often much too closely focused on israel and this also may have clouded their thinking along with colin powell s great song and dance at the u n last year i felt i needed to try something new lately i ve been reading the new yorker reason it s right of center doppelganger some other magazines but i still think the new republic is an excellent source of news and very worthwhile definately you should buy an issue on the news stand try it out
1,great casting dancings and performance well if you keep abusing yourself nobody can save you this so talented broadway genius simply couldn t himself to mess up many women s lives and stubbornly doing harm to himself chain smoking addicting to prescriptioned drugs sleeping around hopping from one woman to another he created so many personal disasters around himself dedicated himself to broadway musicals but never took care of himself burning his own life candle from both ends day and night when the curtain in the theatre falls it would go up again in the next evening but when the curtain of your life decides to come down on you it won t go up again a wonderful movie with a hidden warning lesson to those who in the entertaining show biz

1,since i had always wanted a mad scientist lab when i was a girl and never got one my husband purchased this for my yr old son and i to do together overall it s been fun everything but water has been included which is a plus the lab comes with interlocking pieces which can be assembled in a variety of ways i like this component because it helps children with problem solving creativity and motor skills the kit also comes with recipie cards and its own measuring spoon and beaker it s really taught my son to learn how to measure however the recipie cards tend to generalize and direct you to refer to other recipie cards which my son would not be able to figure out without my help the steps on the cards come with both words and pictures which was a plus but they omitted some details that probably only a grown up would catch on the other hand the experiments or recipies go from simple gelatin molds of bugs to more complicated creatures that progressively build upon previous experiments they also encourage creativity by giving further suggestions for mixing colors flavors i was also pleasantly surprised at how well the experiments actually tasted for a toy kit on the other hand if made as directed we found it difficult to actually fill the monster molds with the amounts directed on the recipie cards overall this was a great gift because it got my son and i to spend some fun time together
1,this sauce is so delicious it s full of good ingredients and has a great shelf life my husband and i can t get enough of this sauce
1,this movie is a classic star movie with all the great comedians of their time and even to latter generations the editor for this movie critique said that this movie is not original helloooo this was made in the of course this movie and it s material is original kind of a noo brainer and whomever gave that critic her job should ctique themselves on why in thee world they gave her the position someone should tell that critic paula self check or whatever that she has no idea as to what she is talking about and if people all over believe critics like her that such timeless masterpieces such as this movie is no good excellent or even a decent movie for that matter no movie worth watching would get any attention so judging for yourself would be thee best option
1,this battery performs as expected it is the standard palm battery meaning it is probably underpowered relative to the power consumption of the device note also that when using bluetooth and or the blackberry rim email service battery life is notably reduced the solution would be lower device consumption or a bigger capacity battery neither of which appear possible at the moment so my solution was to have a second spare battery
0,if i would have been able to try this out before buying it i would have never bought it the surface is way to hard for a baby to be laying on it the it is not too sensitive to movement so when baby kicks or moves it doesnt always turn itself on i would have much rather bought a playmat instead

1,if you are a fan of horror movies the old ec comic books stephen king or just fun movies in general than look no further than this classic the movie creepshow is an anthology of scary stories five of them that is bridged together by a sixth tale of a boy who loves horror comics and his abusive dad who hates them the movie features pitch perfect performances by an all star s cast that seems to be having a lot of fun being in this scream of a movie the stories are as follow father s day stars carrie nye ed harris and viveca lindfors easily the cheesiest of the five stories but still a lot of fun father s day tells the tale of a family reunion from hell when a long dead dad rises from the grave for his caaaaaaakkeeeee and for a little good old fashioned zombie revenge the lonesome death of jordy verrill stars stephen king although its easily the weakest of the stories it s probably also the most original so keep your finger off the fast forward button stephen king gives a nutty and throughly enjoyable performance as a country bumpkin who battles alien plantlife from a meteroite that touches down in his backyard sounds weird you don t know the half of it something to tide you over stars leslie nielsen ted danson and gaylen ross this segment is legendary leslie nielsen gives the performance of his life as a psychotically jealous husband who takes a notion to bury his wife and her lover neck deep in sand before the tide rolls in needless to say love is more powerful than death as our antihero soon finds himself neck deep in terrifying troubles of his own the crate stars hal holbrook adrienne barbeau and fritz weaver hands down the best tale of terror it s no wonder that the three main actors of this single story also receive top billing in the picture s opening credits this epic blood soaked tale of insanity fear and fidelity is a timeless classic with excellent performances all around and an unforgettable monkey like demon from special effects master tom savini the longest segment of the film the crate tells the story of henry holbrook a college professor with an unbelievably obnoxious and domineering wife a brilliant performance by barbeau when henry s colleague dexter stanley weaver discovers a flesh eating monster under the stairway under the stairs of the college and informs henry the henpecked husband makes plans to use the monster to his own domestic advantage this out of this world premise carries very real themes of love and death friends and family and moral responsibility versus personal hapiness with subtle undertones that just hint at the depth of this brilliantly written horror masterpiece stephen king has never been more entertaining than with this perfectly crafted tale they re creeping up on you stars e g marshall bringing us back down for a soft landing romero and king conclude their horror anthology with this wonderfully bizarre tale of a millionaire hypochondriac whose allegedly germ proof apartment is overwhelmed with an army of cockroaches this one goes way over the top but it all keeps with the tempo of the movie if you know somebody who is deathly afraid of bugs try showing them the final scene of this segment then sit back and enjoy their screams of bewilderment all in all i d have to say creepshow is one of the top three horror films ever made rent it or buy it today the disc unfortunately the geniuses over at warner bros have insulted this fine film and its fans by offering up a very lame disc the picture quality is only passable the letterbox formatting is kind of funky and there are absolutely no extras save for a trailer which i don t really count as a real feature the only good thing i can possibly say about the disc is that it s got chapters but only of those are accesible with the disc while we ll have to wait for creepshow to get the same special edition treatment as its inferior sequel this bare bones disc only goes to show the strength of the film in the fact that even with no bonuses at all creepshow is still one of the most rewatchable and indispensable horror movies on the market
0,the sound quality is fine if you are in range the dual headsets work as advertised in other words you cannot talk on both phones at the same time instead you can transfer a call to the other phone the range is not great though i have no complaints with the sound quality when in range of about ft the voicemail alert system sometimes indicates voicemail even though you have none other than that it s a phone that only needs one phone cord and works for a small household

0,it seems that all previous quickbook versions will not run on windows vista and i had upgraded my system so i bought simple start as the least expensive way to get a quickbook product to run on vista turns out simple start runs fine on vista but you cannot load a company file from earlier versions thus simple start was simply useless to me when i called intuit customer service they said that for another they d give me a license number that would unlock that feature by that time i was committed and had no choice talk about getting ripped off

0,i purchased the dopp money clip and card holder for a specific vacation cruise it is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed one it will only hold about six bills and two it demagnetized my room key card twice over eight days realizing this could also demagnetize my regular credit cards i removed them from the card holder i am reluctant to use the money clip again
0,this carafe was initially perfect the design is attractive and simple and it fits well in my bag in the mornings the problem then began that keeping liquids boiling hot would cause it to explode after being jostled in on my morning commute i attempted to remedy this by cooling my morning coffee or tea in the morning although i felt this was partially defeating the purpose of bringing in my own coffee or tea then it became an issue that the liquid would either leak or shoot out of the carafe after being turned the slightest direction other than straight up i d suggest saving yourself the trouble and tea stained clothes by buying a different carafe altogether
1,i love swiss miss cocoa especially the little marshmallows they put in the pack the milk chocolate is great the rich chocolate has a little deeper chocolate semi sweet to darker flavor and the marshmallows are just cool great for the wintertime stock up and enjoy also great to use part of a pack in a cup of coffee get the sweetness of cocoa and the kick of coffee got me through a few late nights

0,while many of the details have been lost to time as well as the consumption of copious amounts of alcohol to numb the pain caused by the first minutes or so of this celluloid nightmare there is just enough in my memory to offer a carefully crafted yet sharply vitriolic rebuke of this horror in my more than four decades on this planet there is only one film that caused such a level of disbelief disgust and abhorrence that i actually walked out of a theater halfway through its showing it was a film so onerous pointless and unfunny that it stands in the pantheon of some of the most colossal wastes of time money and talent in the history of western civilization that film is cabin boy to some cabin boy may well serve as the cornerstone of an evening s entertainment assuming the evening also features sock puppets and pirate hats made out of newspaper imagine watching someone pick at a zit for several hours then eat a sandwich that s the kind of inventive knee slapping laugh out loud fun you ll find in cabin boy having some respect for chris elliott s work on the old letterman show on nbc i was profoundly disappointed by this unspeakably inept attempt at humor if it doesn t induce deep rem sleep cabin boy will surely leave you either angry or depressed one would venture to guess these were not the results elliott intended letterman s genius level cameo notwithstanding cabin boy is about as funny as a prostate exam without the local and the lube
1,the only draw back of this toy as others have said is the arms are stiff and make it hard to hug other than that this toy is simply adorable the motorized sound of movements are hardly noticable and the sounds it makes are truly neat my daughter got this over a year ago she is now and she still loves this bear and we have not had any problems with any broken limbs
0,this sequel to a horror classic started out ok but by the middle none of it mattered anymore i even got a bit tired of the well done gore effects because i had to sit through scenes of a severed and rat duking it out the original reanimator is a great flick to see if you want excellent and original gore effects as well as a creepy storyline but this sequel just stinks
1,i love that soft cat and thought i would get my real cat a friend didnt work oh wel
0,i have read several of hiaasen s books and loved them they were very funny this one is not it is an endless description of naked strippers i found the main character erin to be very unappealing she is just so stupid her problems are all of her own creation and she is not funny i think you have to be a man to like this book i as a woman just found it exceedingly boring i kept waiting for it to get funny it never did

1,i am exceptionally pleased with the product and the company i had a minor problem with the merchandise and let them know i had an immediate response and the problem was rectified faster than i ever expected
0,i have been using this product now for almost a year the only reason i insist using it is because i feel really bad for wasting my money first this is not worth bucks there are only still pictures and sound no movies or any fancy graphics so why the price second it is very repetitive and it does not advance in a very logical way so that you recognize the grammatical structures behind the ever changing sentences third the sentences that you have to repeat over and over are not practical at all you keep memorizing thins like the boy is under the airplane or the ball is on the boy s head initially i thought well this is because it progresses very slowly which is not necessarily bad but then i took a look at the last lessons you just keep repeating useless senteces like these without real things used on a dialogue i cannot recommend you another course because i spent so much in this one that i do not want to try again and get disappointed don t be fooled by the wonderful reviews like i was this is definitively not worth dollars it is not even useful for basic converstion i have learned much more from simple travel books and cassettes from the library ah and if you think that by repeating these structures alone you will understand german grammar
0,i have a business acount with lines three of my phones are the i have had nothing but problems with these phones i have had one repaired three times each time i went to repair it i had to be on a waiting list because of the high level of repairs needed for this model i would get it repaired only to have to do it again a few weeks later now i am having problems with another two of my phones with no reception and battery not charging i keep spending the charge for swapping them and nextel customer service is a joke they will not admit these phones are pieces of crap when i call i wait for an eternity througha million automated systems before finaly reaching a person only to be transferred to someone else only to be disconnected before i reach them

1,i love this salt and use it on my french fries as well as on popcorn it is not as good as fleur de sel or some of the other gourmet salts but it is only cents per ounce not dollars note that this salt is flaked unlike the normal crystals for which diamond salt is known it absolutely clings to the surface of the popcorn fries and other similarly textured foods much better it has a cleaner taste than some of the brown or grey sea salts and clean is always good in my book as a treat i sometimes iick the tip of my index finger sprinkle a little of this on it and then pretend like i m getting ready to do a mini tequilla shooter but without the lime almost like a couple of hours on the beach i can only give it four stars instead of five because it is not iodized and you could end up looking just like a frog with big goiter things on your neck if you don t get enough iodine this is not a problem for people who eat a lot of seafood but if you live in the midwest far from the ocean it could cause some difficulties
1,product works great used it up against sam s club mechanic and it passed with flying colors would purchase it again try it you ll like it
1,my daughter yrs old likes this cot a lot i bought it for her so that she could nap on it while my m i l is over watching her since she has a hard time with stairs and lifting toddler into high crib she sleeps on it for about hours in the afternoon which is about hour shorter than if she were to nap in her crib inside her darkened room it suits this purpose well and i intend on taking it on overnight weekend trips so we don t have to haul her port a crib the only disadvantage is that she can get out of it of course but it s a cot she began daycare recently and sleeps on their cots for the same amount of time so i figured i d buy it for my m i l at home it does the trick and my baby thinks it s special i tell her that it s only for when grandma s is over b c she wanted to start sleeping napping in it all the time naturally i d prefer she take a longer nap so i told her it s for special days only when grandma s is here so now she uses it to tuck in her bunny bear stuffed animal before she goes to her room at night i love it and it seems comfortable very portable and handy i would recommend it the only reason i m not rating it stars is that i have yet to use it on a weekend trip but i wanted to review it now in case you were wondering whether or not to get it i think it s very much worth it but everyone s different it s relatively small and inexpensive so if your child hates it they may like it for their stuffed animal friends also it is very sturdy supportive and opens and collapses with no trouble at all hope that helps
0,i bought this dvd because i really adore the strokes good music good people good style not so good documentary whoever made this video should not make anymore at all the strokes were not even in this besides very few pictures second clips of them the exclusive interviews were not that exclusive no sound from any of the strokes no interviews with them i can go on i mean c mon a documentary of the strokes should at least have the strokes in it right
1,this is a surprisingly good radio at this price it is small compact and yet very robust and quite heavy it is nothing like the cheapie plastic radios one sees in the drug store here are three things i really liked about this product the am fm reception is outstanding i am in a bad area with few stations and this model gets them in clean and clear listening to fm on my stereo headphones was a real pleasure the buttons and controls are easy to use and sensible in function this is something sangean seems to get very well the multi level display lighting can be turned off or up in steps from dull to very bright a few things i didn t like the pilot light for on is a like an intense blue laser and lights up the entire room at night i had to put black electrical tape over it the aux input is a mini jack instead of rca connector minor inconvenience here and finally the cabinet is nice wood but the finish is not as good as i think it could be this radio is a pleasure to use and it sounds better than i expected for this price it s a keeper
1,i am very surprised how well this case fit my razr it fits very well and looks very nice
0,this was required reading for my british literature class it s the only novel in the class that i struggled with and only struggled from boredom it is entirely possible that i just do not understand the genius that is forster but i did not enjoy this novel a lover of forster or modernist writing might enjoy it more it must be a classic for a reason

0,chicane should just stop releasing material under that guise ever again fftmc and bts were lush and beautiful productions nicks latest attempts have been pathetic from a musical standpoint and from a professional production standpoint even his older pop remixes for other artists were better than this rubbish he s doing these days no we re not saying recycle the older productions but instead it s a matter of putting the effort and originality in the profuctions a signature if you will and hey it doesn t have to pigeon hole you if done with class yes how the mighty have fallen oh brother
1,by winning their third title in four years the same year that the baseball team that defines the hopes and dreams of generations of new englanders wins its first world series in years it s true the patriots somehow pieced together a team that despite a string of injuries that seemed to defy all rationality and managed to finish a second consecutive campaign as super bowl champions with a record which just as easily could have should have been but the boston red sox completely sucked the oxygen out of the american sports atmosphere and somehow the patriots season just doesn t seem to measure up to the previous title years of and part of the reason is that the previous years seemed to have their own personalities having the coming of age of tom brady the snow bowl and the unbelievable finish of what was probably the most exciting super bowl ever had the release of lawyer milloy the early stumbles to buffalo and washington the birth of the winning streak winter weather in foxboro and yet another thrilling super bowl finish just seemed like an anticlimax by comparison like you were watching a scripted performance that was always going to end with the w on the patriots side of the field this is not to say that there were not intriguing challenges that made for good storytelling the injuries leading to the incredible throwback two way play of veteran wide receiver rookie cornerback troy brown the continued winning streak the rebirth of offseason acquisition corey dillon the continuing mastery of the indianapolis colts and the return to pittsburgh where the record game winning streak came to an emphatic end on halloween just days after the red sox won the world series karmically enough where university of michigan graduate tom brady resurrected himself from a triple digit fever the night before to thoroughly dismantle the best regarded defense in the nfl to send the patriots back to the super bowl this time in the unfairly maligned city of jacksonville fl no nail biting endings this time though despite the best efforts of terrell owens to come back from a leg and ankle injury that would have ended the season of anyone else with the possible exception of curt schilling of course the eagles all pro was clearly the second best receiver on the field as deion branch won the super bowl mvp for a record day safetyman and render of mayhem extraordinaire rodney harrison would have been my pick actually and the patriots though trailing early never really seemed in doubt of winning a game they led by points late before prevailing by the final score of which in truth flattered the eagles more than they deserved far be it that a season ending with a record of and another super bowl ring should be considered hum drum but there was something missing from the campaign that impressive as it was just doesn t translate to the memorable re telling that the pats previous title years do this is a great dvd for pats fans indispensible even but for the casual fan who appreciates the drama that a good nfl season can bring i would recommend either of the previous patriots highlights dvd s over this one
1,i picked this sucker up for from fred meyer after they made it clear that they had no other options available for charging my ipod from my computer i was on vacation with no cord and a dead battery i was only expecting it to last throughout the vacation but i ve been using it ever since i keep the car charger in my car with no extra cables to burden it and i keep the wall charger plugged into the wall the cable retracts easily with a design much like that of a window blind pull until you let go where it locks and then pull a bit more and let go to release it s a small unobtrusive and incredibly convenient device for your ipod and at this price it s a steal you d pay two or three times this at some electronics stores for the wall charger or car charger alone let alone one that is so solidly constructed no question if you own an ipod purchase this product i was impressed enough to come and write this review perhaps you will be too

0,well nice cinematography as set designer work nicely interiors and well dressed actors maybe visually it is enough to keep you watching this movie once but not enough to consider it as a remarkable movie of year as other reviewers trying to assure
0,i was surprised to find positive reviews for this heating pad since i just returned mine after one use perhaps the one i got was defective but even on the highest setting this heating pad was barely warm to the touch and wasn t hot enough to penetrate my sore back muscle i also thought that the convenience of strapping the pad on would be excellent to target the lower back area and found the shape of the pad and the flimsy elastic strap provided to be very uncomfortable to wear the placement of the strap doesn t allow the pad to conform to the body but only to press against it where the strap runs through just the center not the rest of the pad i realize there are probably now safety standards for heating pads that preclude them from getting too warm but hopefully they are not so stringent as to not allow any electric heating device from getting warm enough to penetrate sore muscles properly for the time being i ll keep wearing thermacare tm back wraps which are expensive could have bought two heating pads by now but do last hours at a time and provide intense enough heat also this disposable product is surprisingly comfortable to wear and more directly applies heat to the area where i need it if you need intense heat for a sore back i d skip this heating pad
0,this was my first download of this type and also my last i did get it to play with my desktop where i downloaded it but moving it to any other machine has been a nightmare there are too many software restrictions and even a legal attempt to buy a new licence is fruitless the machines keep freezing up the idea is nice but the technology isn t there yet

0,the kidz bop series is the ultimate travesty in music and don t think that it s good just because your kids might love it kids also like to eat mcdonalds but don t try telling me that their food is healthy there is plenty of good music out there than is clean enough for children and surprisingly a lot of these songs are very inappropriate for children even with the expletives deleted there is no reason on earth why these records should exist excepting for the fact that record execs want to milk more money out of the singles once their radio play starts to diminish i agree with the person who suggested the beatles as an alternative seriously don t buy this
0,cheap cheap cheap i know you get what you pay for but bucks after shipping is a lot to pay for nothing in return the thing didn t respond to my guitar and the store said that it s probably defective and to return it but you don t get repaid for any of the shipping so it s hardly worth the effort buying this just resulted in headache and frustration
0,i have had trouble and no satisfaction with this product i am downloading grateful dead concerts from the internet i want to turn them into audio or data cds sometimes i get a whole concert as one giant file i want to cut that into tracks and save it sometimes i get a bunch of tracks i want to combine the songs that go into one another my car stereo inserts a two second delay between tracks one of the things i want to do is to save the files which are mostly in the same bit rate and format as the originals so i loose as little music as possible the codec seems to be really buggy most of the combinations of bit rates and codec strategies create really wacky files some go normal speed others are compressed into chopped up shortened versions of the original when i pick a combination of settings that work i usually lose a lot of fidelity as compared to the original even when i m only combinining four s into one try cutting one into two and then recombining the parts into a whole no matter what i try there s a little click in the place where the two files are joined this should be an easy thing since a lot of very basic editing is cutting and splicing the upshot is buying this was down the drain i m going to have to find better software for my purposes
1,i literally spent about hours today trying to find a single store in my county that carry the haribo peaches i went everywhere because i needed my fix trolli peach rings just don t cut it when you have a hankerin for these candies whooopee
1,there is no denying that star wars battlefront is one of the best video game series that is currently available the first game was really amazing let us participate in some of the places seen in all six movies but even though the game was really fun it felt like there was something still missing the missing piece was put in and this is the result this is not a disappoinment but the best unlike the first game when the main story gameplay was just caputring bases and killing all of the enemy forces here there are actually missions to complete from having to retrieve data discs to killing rebel leaders this game is more indepth than it s predecessor in game there are still times when bases have to be captured like in the first game but you no longer have to kill all of the enemies the coolest part of the game is that you get to ride in different ships and other things from the movies lots of fun so overall this game really is an improvement over the first but some may prefer the first more the reason being that the first game is basically kill everyone and take their bases and that is less seen here with the focus is more on protecting things and stealing things
1,i have had this for month now and i love it it does record the outdoor and indoor temp you can change the display to either show both or only indoor with an expanded clock we had owned another la crosse clock that is beamed onto the ceiling at night also great and we did not have to set up another outdoor senser both clocks work off of the one to display the outdoor temp never have to worry about being late because of a clock loosing time it is updated every hours i love it
1,to set the record straight rodney darkchild jerkins produced one song on this album and that is he said that said producer waryn baby dubb campbell also husband of erika younger of the duo did a great job on this album not at all to say that the ladies singing hasn t always been phenomenal the highlights of this album include the aforementioned darkchild song a guest apperance by fred hammond on this love their appearance on his album speak those things is duly noted an impressively done cover of stevie wonder s you will know and a cover of walter hawkins thank you yes that is the original sampled at the end of the song every album that mary mary has released to this day yes all two of them has proven that gospel music can be musically current impressive and still within taste that s what happens when you have the best on your team baby dubb while being mary mary s resident producer can also be found on kierra sheard s let go sweetest thing all i am fred hammond s albums speak those things and somethin bout love and countless other records the downside the last two songs they re of forgettable quality while happy forgettable overall this album is an essential
0,certainly not deserving of the grammy for cast recording each of the other nominated productions is much better than this poor excuse of a revival
1,i got this for my husband because he had to shave too frequently and i thought they d improve upon the well they did this turbo brand of mach is actually much better his shave lasts longer the blades last longer and it leaves a very attractive smooth shave i choose this one over that power vibrating blade because i don t know a sharp blade the vibrates is asking for trouble in my opinion haha he s very happy with it and likes the shave and speaking about money if the shave and blades last longer than before it s a great value highly suggested

1,we saw this online and really wanted it but decided to wait because of the reviews well today we went to an outlet store that sells new stuff at huge discount prices and it was only my son has already ridden the heck out of it with no problems and he loves it we havent had to replace a fuse and it just the right size for my and a half year old its a really great little bike but for the workmanship of it i definitly wouldnt pay dollars for it maybe most we just got blessed with a really great deal so if ya want this for your kids its great for the smaller rider and just the right speed for him to control hope this helps someone
1,the snuggle nest gave my husband and i peace of mind while co sleeping with our son i thought about purchasing the arm s reach co sleeper but my son wanted to be real close to us through the night our son is ten weeks old and it still works it is cumbersome when trying to nurse because you have to sit up and pull the baby out and after a cesarean that proved to be a little difficult i m hoping the transition to his crib will be easy with the snuggle nest by putting the snuggle nest into his crib the little light is helpful when trying to get my son to latch on during nursing or chaning diapers in the middle of the night the bedside light wakes my husband
0,i got this light before the led lights started coming out in the retail channel those lights tend to almost be too bright but they have the advantage of running for ages on tiny batteries unfortunately this light uses aa batteries which makes it fairly hefty it alternatively can operate on an ac adapter this makes it lighter but it s still bulky because of the battery compartment the good the light is nicely bright with a natural quality that s easy on the eyes it has a ratcheting arm so you can put it where you want and it stays there better than most of the flexible arm ones includes an ac adapter slot though no ac adapter can help weigh down lighter books to keep the pages from turning nice large clamp for attaching to books lamp shade which allows you to throw the light where you want without blinding your vision decent quality plastic made in china the bad no brightness adjustment heavy can be a benefit in some cases and makes holding up a book all the more tiring bulky makes it really hard for a book to sit properly in your hand the ratcheting mades a loud click which can wake your wife in bed the clip has very limited strength and seems to slip easily eats up batteries fairly quickly i use rechargeables in it now i m giving it an even because it s a pain to use really hopefully i can find a light weight led clip on which has a brightness adjustment with a quiet arm that stays in place and most importantly natural lighting if so i ll review it on here but most leds wash out the page making it hard to read the nice quality lamp is the only reason this one doesn t get stars
1,after i had my son we bought a graco double stoller but it was so long heavy and cumbersome that i only used it a few times before we decided to get rid of it we bought this tandem stroller a few months ago and i love it great stoller lightweight easy to manuvuer and my year old loves to ride in it b c he can either sit or stand in the back it s much smaller when folded up than most of the other double strollers on the market too i wish that i had known earlier that it also has an infant carseat attachment i highly recommend this stoller but do wish that the parent tray cup holder came standard with the stoller
1,i bought the clock for my wife it arived on time like they said it was in great shape it works great the projection part does just what it says and yes it is dim when it is daylight or the light is on but i dont know of any that is not like that its nice to wake up at night or in the morn to look up and see what the temp is outside we would buy from amazon again
1,my hair tends to fall out due to me not eating enough protein so new hair is a lifesaver as others have said it lathers like you wouldn t believe you really only need to roll it in your hands two or three times to get enough for a thick lather and it has an amazing scent sniffing the bar can actually be a bit addictive you can smell it really strongly even before you open the box i ve found that keeping it in a small lightly covered dish in my bedroom away from the moisture of the bathroom is the best way to preserve it for a while also it works as an accidental room freshener seriously the smell is incredible my only wish is that the scent would last a little longer in my hair since it doesn t really stick even right after showering unless i use a lot of lather and that ends up being expensive since then the bar doesn t last as long most of the time there isn t even much of a hint whereas other lush shampoos can make your hair smell wonderful even a bit overpowering for days also unlike some of the other lush products it leaves my hair fairly flat it s true that it helps with making hair really soft and shiny but it seems to have the opposite effect when it comes to volume and that s not so good when you re already having some hair loss using a mostly scent free conditioner after is almsot necessary at least in my experience i think new hair is a terrific shampoo for its hair restoring qualities and general sniffability but at the same time it could be a little better with its more cosmetic qualities buy it more for the former than the latter if you want the most enjoyment and value out of it and if you do have hair loss trust me the price is worth it
0,i read many positive reviews on pure grace and decided to try it since i love a fresh clean scent i was very disapointed when i used it as it reminded me of jean nate which to me is an old lady smell it was more musky than clean smelling i couldn t smell any hint of feminine sweetness or floweriness to it it smelled like scented musky water with a sesemee oil that is the only way i can describe it
1,i bought a zen player and could not stand the earbuds they came with they hurt so much that i used head phones until these v moda earbuds came in they are awesome the fit is so comfortable and the sound it wonderful i got them on sale for less than they are running right now on amazon so i feel pretty good about the purchase
0,waller should win an award for the most times reprocessing the same book and making money from it come on show some imagination
0,unless you want the editor s liberal political views shoved down your throat avoid this magazine it leans to the left so hard that you have to lie on your side to even read it and no i am not a republican or democrat but an independent who looks at all sides the editor of this magazine has a huge agenda to get the democrats back in power he bashes bush and the republican party over the head with a ton hammer on a monthly basis yet worships eco phonies like laurie david and celebrities who want the rest of us to drive eco friendly cars while they fly the world in their private jets i understand laurie and her friends like sheryl crow are trying to wean themselves off this practice by cutting down on their private jet hopping trips a wee bit and using a huge gas guzzling bus that is criss crossing the country instead but that poor laurie is finding this hard to give up what hyprocrites these hollywood folks are though i am personally trying to do my bit for the environment i hate when i read issues like the current green issue where these so called eco environmentalists really only want us common people to make the changes this used to be a great fashion entertainment and current event magazine with a lot of in depth articles but now it is only a political platform publication i now will just throw it away as soon as it arrives when i receive it until my subscription expires
1,i love this magazine it has up to the minute need to know celeb news honestly most of the time what they say in these tabloid magazines turns out to be true jessica simpson split and brad and angelina jen and vince just to name a few also there s movie dvd music reviews makeup and fashion tips and the clothes they have in there are affordable so you can dress like your favorite celeb i look forward to each week getting this magazine
0,well the fact that i m writing a review about this book while it s sitting open on my desk next to my computer open and not being read might be some evidence of how i m enjoying this book this book just goes on and on in complex an unclear language about a subject which shouldn t be so difficult this book is not clear or easy to understand at all every sentence is awkward and followed by a footnote and the masses of footnotes together take up half of each page making this work look like a research project for a phd publication i have the casebook in this series and sometimes it seems reading the cases alone will bring more clarity and it turns to be true this book might be good if you re advanted contracts and want to know every little detail or as an advanced reference later on to look something up like in an encyclopedia some concepts which should be pretty clear just get too in depth coverage in this book it s too complex for a first year student sometimes it starts describing the different views out there and then there s a jumble in your head as to what the law really is i wish the author used his own knowledge and fluid language more than footnoted ideas from other authors
1,the bench is comfortable and has enough weight so the wind does not blow it over the cushion is real nice and it dries quickly plus it fastens to the bench with only two small velcro straps two people can sit on the bench in comfort

1,this book gives a thorough analysis on how public policies were the catalysts for the socioeconomic destruction of low income communities of color in new york city necessary reading for those who still do not realize that activism and organizing are important vehicles through which marginalized communities keep in check the forces that seek to further fragment and disenfranchise them
1,the talons of weng chiang is a wonderfully creepy pseudo historical tale full of mood atmosphere and an unusual amount of violence for doctor who almost as if departing producer philip hinchcliffe was taking a parting shot at his critics on his way out but it s not all gloom and doom this storyline is a fine mix indeed of good old doctor who humor at its funniest as well as thrilling doctor who adventure at its most gruesome the dank and dour city streets and slums of late century london make a grim backdrop for a tale of manipulation madness and serial murder technologically refined cannibalism really and yet the doctor s many clever quips and leela s naively astute observations on civilized victorian life keeps the viewer laughing throughout and the main villain s second hand man li hsen chang has some incredibly witty one liners as well li hsen chang himself is a fascinating character delightfully entertaining on stage and yet cold and ruthless in his service to weng chiang a stranded time traveling dictator from the future who has deceived chang into believing he s a deity from the taoist pantheon chang s paranormal powers foremost of which is hypnotism definitely evoke the late victorian fascination with mesmerism see the poster advertising his show and serve to mark him as a clever echo of the evil fu manchu characters so much the stock villains of pulp fiction and yet he s also a tragic figure in many ways a healthy innocent rural farmer whose simple religious beliefs were abused by an evil man uprooted and given extraordinary powers along with refinement and authority by his god and yet irrevocably corrupted in the process in many ways this works as a dark counterpoint to the pygmalion style educational program the doctor s putting leela through to her annoyance if li hsen chang is an interesting and complex adversary though the same can t really be said for his master weng chiang himself he s a rather unremarkable two dimensional villain i m afraid complete with hokey bad guy laugh and over the top acting perhaps the writers were going for a sort of campy effect but if so they overdid it just a bit at times too he s just more annoying than frightening every time the ever loyal li hsen is faithfully going about their nefarious business only to be thwarted by the doctor weng chiang throws a fit savagely berating the poor guy on and on ad nauseum on this score weng chiang is less evil incarnate than a bad reminder of some dysfunctional manager at one s workplace it doesn t help either that he bears no resemblance whatsoever to the clean cut bureaucratic deity of education whom he s presumably impersonating so that the whole idea comes across as altogether somewhat unconvincing all in all though this is an enjoyable adventure the doctor is at his sleuthing best leela shines as a displaced neolithic warrior and a fine complement of vividly memorable supporting characters keep the story moving right along in an entertaining fashion all of them brought to life by a fine script and even finer acting and anyway li hsen more than makes up for weng chiang s deficiencies as an interesting villain for most of the show while the cyborg assassin mr sin is genuinely creepy especially if you have a phobia of ventriloquist dolls so this is a fine storyline altogether as long as you take some of it with a grain of salt or a dash of soy sauce rather
0,i ll be brief first of all out of the reviews of this product currently on amazon are star that should tell you something pros when it actually works it does cool down your cons crashing caused more crashes than it prevented running without the nyko instantly reduced the number of crashes and freezing problems i had loud as hell turn on your put a hairdryer next to it and turn it on on low step back and sit where you normally play that is how loud this product will make your hard to set up frequently stops working it took a lot of playing around just to get it to work the first time it snap fits well to the back of the but despite that there s some impossible magic to the angles and tightness of the power connector we re talking millimeter tolerances here if you re off by just a tiny bit it won t work at all and the xbox won t even power on this wouldn t be too bad if you only had to go through this headache once but no it s loose enough that you risk disconnecting it and setting it up all over again every time you touch the power cord or move the many people have reported this unit causing actual damage to their you better have a replacement plan for your handy and never mention the nyko when you try to rma your box if you let it slip you probably won t be covered that s it for the nyko i returned mine within weeks i ve been searching for a good cooler for the since i got one unfortunately it is my opinion that there are no good coolers for the on the market the fan stands yes i ve bought and returned them are decent coolers but require you to run your vertically which is a big no no a number of websites have shown that the dvd rom drive will eat your dvds and games when it s vertical i had hoped this was overexaggerated but then the problems started happening to me i ver personally seen what appears to be damage on my mint condition games when running the vertically i also experienced frequent game loading problems including hideous slowdowns in games like halo where you can actually see a progress bar when played on a vertical it worked just fine with it horizontally so horizontal is the way to go in the end i ended up building my own cooler out of some old still loud but much quieter computer fans and a volt adapter and slapped it on the side works well probably cools as well as the nyko but without the noise or the crashing your best bet if you can t do something like that is to just buy a little clip fan with its own power adapter and have it blow into the right side bottom the vents away from the dvd drive of your

0,i wish i could give this stroller stars because it doesn t even deserve the one i gave it it s a light stroller there the only plus where do i start how about how after using it for one week the wheel fell off and they wanted to charge me shipping to replace it because i didn t have a reciept it was shower gift after arguing with their lack luster service team and proving with a birth ceritficate that my daughter was only a week old and that is as long as i had been using it they shipped a new wheel free of charge fast forward to our vacation in hawaii the sun shade is non existent and i had to use a light blanket draped over the hood to protect my baby from the sun the steering stinks i have spilled drinks all over me and my baby because the cup holder moves and doesn t hold anything but a small water bottle the basket is hard to get to and holds nothing easily because it is so awkward my husband and i went on a hike and came to the end of the path that wasn t paved he asked me are you worried about leaving the stroller so we can continue on the sand i replied please i hope someone takes this piece of end of story i wouldn t invest in the pliko either don t get me started in the peg perego car seat either junk

1,these work great for keeping the earbuds comfortably in place while allowing one to hear others speaking say in a grocery store of course they do not provide audiophile quality sound but they re great for listening to podcasts while doing the shopping the only downside is they are bulky and so do not fit in any earbud holder while not in use taking the eargels off to store the earbuds off is possible but difficult enough to be annoying
0,this is a surprisingly poor movie although it has some well known actors and a notable director the material was just presented badly and predictably like a lousy late night tv movie with profanity inserted to liven it up the movie makes a simplified joke of the legal system and its sterotypical failings though legitimate in many cases it also glosses over the grieving process of the family ignores the normal safety warnings to the remaining child overdoes kiefer sutherland s character flaws which are considerable nevertheless and generally oversimplifies everything into a neat package to which you already know the ending because of the spoiler title in one particularly bad scene after taking martial arts classes and other measures to prepare herself mentally and physically sally s character simply stares open mouthed and dumbfounded at keifer s character when they meet on the street and he talks to her i don t know what i missed that the and star reviewers like so much i only see wide spread mediocrity i would only recommend this for fans of keifer ssssssorry sally not your best role or movie ditto ed harris whose other movies i generally like
1,quiller s guide is the most systematic color text available it combines a deep knowledge of traditional color theories with a huge amount of quiller s personal research into how paints actually mix as colors central to the book is quiller s color mixing wheel for watercolors oils and acrylics probably the most accurate color wheel available in any published work though he has a revised color wheel available separately he explores the monochrome analogous complementary and split complementary color schemes through many demonstration paintings and detailed mixing instructions he emphasizes repeatedly the importance of a strong value composition and careful variations in color saturation in building the painting an indispensible book
0,do not buy this magazine it has been falsely advertised it does not hold rds like it say but really holds only it is the exact same magazine that comes with the high power steyr i bought two of these thinking they were rounds and got them today i feel completly ripped off

0,harper s bazaar is a pretty decent fashion magazine but i wish now that i had never gotten a subscription true each issue would be more expensive but i could pick out what issues seemed worth buying as some are thin and empty they are quite often late with their delivery or you miss an issue i have only gotten one issue on time to be honest
1,this album was by far the bands most daring ablum they went away from the classic inxs sound that made them superstars kick x and instead updated their sound to fit the time like a previous reviewer noted this was when grunge was becoming very popular in the us and unfortunately caused this album to go unnoticed for the most part its sad too cuz there are many solid tracks inlcuding heaven sent my favorite not enough time baby dont cry and beautiful girl i have recently become a big fan of inxs and have purchased all of their albums i like this one in particular because it is different from all their other albums i recommend welcome to any inxs fan and any other fan of great music

1,i love this set of cards so many beautiful unique cards that will really make an impact the organizer is such a great concept and can be used forever just go out and buy new cards to replace those that you ve used in a category as another reviewer reports there is a lack of male cards and most cards are on the feminine side but that probably is more telling of the population that gives cards i bought my set at costco where the price was much lower fifteen dollars a great deal if you are able to snag them there
1,as an er trauma nurse i have seen and been involved in many many cardiac arrests here is some information that you need to know you must still perform adequate cpr if not brain death occurs within minutes of oxygen deprivation to the brain even with trained personnel cpr a defibrillator and advanced cardiac life support medications the survival rate is very very low i am not telling you this to discourage purchasing this aed it is a wonderful unit i have been trained on it and had to use it once i am letting you know that if you are willing to spend over on a defibrillator especially for a private home then a good idea would be to spend another and take a basic cpr class i hope that no one that buys this ever has to use it
0,when i ordered this skort the description didn t say that it was a childs size so i complained to the site that i bought it from i asked that my shipping also be returned because they didn t specify that this was a childs size i wasted my money on shipping for an item i wouldn t have ordered if i had known it wasn t an adult sized item they didn t return my shipping
1,i was assigned this book for a college course and was greatly surprised at its quality blamires had c s lewis as a tutor and i ve read some of lewis s writings and have found them to be above average but not particularly special many people do find his works special of course blamires on the other hand i find to be very unique his book is top quality and very helpful i m surprised this isn t a very popular book as it ought to be i have only two complaints both of which are purely stylistic first the edition i have looks like it s a copy of an earlier edition which makes the text hard to read i got used to it after a while though some publisher should take it upon themself to retype this book and republish it my second criticism is something that can t be avoided the book was originally written in the early sixties so a lot of the examples are dated i e references to wwii which was still in memory also out of date terms like jive etc however just a few of the examples are affected by this the book as a whole could be reasonably passed off today as a recent work since so much blamires s criticism of the christian mind or lack thereof still sadly applies however the christian mind today is being rediscovered and the march of atheism is on the decline with the march of religion in general on the rise even though things are looking up christians should keep blamires s book in mind not to get too comfortable with this secular world for our real home is beyond bodily death that we ought to have a supernatural orientation is basically the theme and summary of this book superb book and i really recommend this to anyone this is definitely recommended for christians and also for any non christian who are curious and want to take a look at some of the problems christians have today
0,i was unfortunate enough to have stumbled across this in i was thinking it would be a good sit down and watch type of movie but it was really lackluster the acting is wooden the script is very lame and worst of all the action isn t very exciting i expected a much better movie from director richard donner there is a battle scene and there are action scenes but they just aren t exciting when the action isn t exciting you better have a good story the story here is alright but certainly not enough to save the movie i don t hate any of the actors they are decent when they have something to work with here they had nothing to work with so they obviously didn t do too well this time this really isn t worth your time i gave this to the thrift shop after i got it and i feel sorry for the person who bought it there
1,these shoes are durable comfortable and most importantly come in different widths most other athletic shoe manufacturers apprarently don t make anything but d width new balance does for those of you complaining about width my guess is that if you size your feet correctly that problem will go away i had always worn a width until some gentleman at a mom and pop store sized my feet correctly for the first time in my life i found out i need a you may think you know your feet but you may not as to comfort i can t complain as to durability maybe they are a little stiffer but if that is what extends the life of these shoes over the others that is well worth it in my book
1,this merchant really delivers with this item in the stores this is almost twice the price i really wasn t expecting such quality from this item yes it s crushed velvet so not warm but warm wasn t the goal would definitely recommend this item and may buy another color for myself
0,i recently tried to update my norton systemworks halfway through the update i got a message telling me it was unable to uninstall my old norton systemworks i tried to back out of the installation at that point but was unable i called the norton company spent an hour on the phone with a tech only to have them tell me it was my computer i assured them that i was just using my computer which was fine and now it doesn t work they told me there was nothing further that they could do and that i would have to call a computer service company i found out that the uninstall process corrupted my operating system causing me to lose everything on my hard drive and requiring a new operating system i have run into other people who had exactly the same problem with no help from the norton company i will never again buy a norton product i only wish i could get my money back from them

1,i bought this clock last week amazon was prompt in shipping it on time on having received it i place the aa battery in the clock selected the time zone place it on the wall after some time the clock second hand and hour hand started moving fast it is actually searching for the signal if it gets it immediately the time will be set accurately in minutes if not every hour the clock searches for the accurate time relayed from the colorado server the clock finds the time signal within the next hours the chances of the clock finding the signal is high over night when there is less distortion once ir receives the accurate time it will never fall behind a very good time piece
1,it s cute well packaged and easy but time consuming to put together for the price it can t be beat too bad there s no photo she ll use it for a while and we ll sell it online when we are done and probably get most of our money back

1,i shoot with a canon and have used the canon ef f iii usm lens i ve always noticed the limitations of this lens when shooting amateur softball i reviewed the lens lineup at the canon website and decided on the canon ef f usm lens the is a great lens but it can be a bit soft for that reason i decided to add the canon ef f is usm telephoto zoom lens to my lens collection this is a serious lens meant for serious photographers being an l lens there is a lot of features and is manufactured with better materials with a high level of dust and moisture resistance the construction is sturdy and consists of elements in groups the four super ud glass elements largely eliminate the secondary spectrum reducing residual chromatic aberration an improved blade circular aperture offers a more pleasing out of focus image the canon ef lens weighs in at about lbs g and accepts filters with a minimal focusing distance of ft m this lens is compatible with the extenders ii and ii be sure to get a good quality uv haze filter to protect the front lens element being white this lens looks a bit strange but helps keep it stay cool when shooting in the sun some people are concerned that being white it attracts attention to criminals from my experience my attracts attention regardless of what lens i put on it in addition i most likely have a camera bag and tripod monopod with me to further attract attention i personally doubt a thief looking for something to steal is taking the time to evaluate the cost of the item and are more concerned with the ease of taking something they can unload i try to make things difficult for would be thieves and have insurance as a back up the dual is system has two modes mode is for stationary subjects while mode two is for moving subjects it is recommended that the is function is not used on a tripod however i have used it on my monopod with success the is helps to eliminate camera shake and helps stabilize the lens when shooting from a moving vehicle while there are limitations to what the is can do it can give you a few extra stops just keep in mind the is attempts to eliminate camera movement not the movement of the subject being photographed this lens permits for auto or manual focus depending on how the switch is set there is also a switch to shift from a to infinity or to infinity included with this lens are the tripod mount lens hood and storage case the tripod mount is the best option to use when mounting to a tripod this helps to balance the load mounting the camera instead creates an unbalanced set up that may topple over the case is a zippered soft case that can also be purchased separately the lens hood et is used to reduce lens flare and can protect the front element in certain situations often times amazon recommends purchasing the lens case and hood however they are normally included with the lens the canon ef is such an awesome lens it almost fails to compare to the canon ef the canon lens is a well used option for me but the clarity and sharpness of the is lens is more refined the auto focus is quiet and quick this lens can be used for portraits landscape sports or as a general walk about lens the f combined with the is makes this a good option for certain low light situations the features add creative versatility the canon ef is lens comes at a price but it is worth every bit of it pros incredible clarity and sharpness quiet and quick auto focus features add creative versatility dual is system cons heavy and bulky this should be expected with these types of lenses

0,my smoker arrived dented and chipped which i wasn t happy about but i could live with i don t expect a relatively inexpensive outdoor oven to maintain its new look after some wear and tear anyways however the rails along the sides that hold the shelves are not welded together well in fact two rails arrived completely broken off opposite sides and at different levels and a third was tenuously held in place by a single weld i thought that the broken off rails were parts to be used in the oven s assembly otherwise i would not have unboxed the smoker and put it together i would have returned it because i had assembled the unit before realizing that it was broken i thought that replacing the broken parts would be easier than disassembling the unit re crating and returning it i called the distributor three weeks ago to order replacement parts that have not yet arrived i ve already waited longer than the distributor indicated i would have to before receiving the parts if alternative gas fueled smokers didn t cost a multiple of what this costs i d be really angry hands down this is the most unsatisfactory purchase i ve made from amazon in spite of the impairment of not having a fully functioning smoker i have seasoned it and used it once the chicken i made was promising my hope that my experience with this smoker will improve lets me award a rating of stars based on this one use if i ever get the parts i need i think the smoker will be adequate for initial experimentation with this kind of cooking if i like the results i ll replace this smoker with a better one
1,my two year old thinks this toy is the best thing in the world it s so easy to get him to take a bath now the crayons are great and come off the tub easily i give him a hand towel in the tub and he wipes the desk and tub off the compartment to keep the crayons in is good but a little difficult for my son to open thank you for making this

1,this snack is superb in several ways first it is very good tasting the flavor is very much like a soft peanut butter cookie nutritionally it has quite a bit of protein very very low in simple carbohydrates or sugars and is high in fiber i carry these with me to work and eat one in the morning and one in the afternoon to help me keep away from junk foods and excessive caffeine these would be excellent to carry with you on a hiking trip

1,in my fair lady returned to broadway in a revival touted as the anniversary production perhaps most famously this particular revival was the first big professional splash of a young soprano called christine andreas at long last this much sought after cast album gets its cd premiere christine andreas is one of the best eliza s ever captured on disc and ian richardson s performance as beleaguered tutor higgins is full of wit and humour george rose in a tony winning turn as eliza s dustman father is very enjoyable in his main numbers with a little bit of luck and get me to the church on time jerry lanning also makes for a fine freddy with the winsome on the street where you live this recording also features the embassy waltz sequence which was never included on the obc and only featured as a bonus track on the reissue of the olc the production itself heavily recreated the original production complete with oliver smith s sets and cecil beaton s costumes hanya holm s choreography was revived thanks to original dance captain crandall diehl christine andreas picked up a theatre world award for her breakthrough performance the show opened at the st james theatre on march but later moved to the lunt fontanne theatre where it closed the following year after performances the following year andreas returned to broadway in another important revival the production of oklahoma in which she made a thrilling laurey cast album available on rca before cememting her position as broadway s ingenue of choice with the role of frankie frayne in the revival of on your toes cast album available on jay ter more recently she played marguerite st just in the original company of frank wildhorn s flawed scarlet pimpernel cast album available on atlantic i heartily recommend this particular my fair lady
1,ever since the colorizing debate of a generation ago this question has been asked over and over again and we ve finally settled it i hope this dvd gives the viewer options of seeing it in the way it was originally released or with the ending created by its maker like everybody else i d only seen the chopped version labelled by some here as surreal well there were plenty of other surreal elements throughout the original most epsecially the surreal premise that ralph meeker was an actor however i would urge even the purists among you to take a very very close look at the intended ending it adds so much to what came before and helps us understand the childlike attitudes we had towards this weaponry we d just been the first to use in the name of world peace this new era was far from innicent but we were like children with the power we had a great film now made even better for history
1,let me be honest here i m not a big fan of either nicole kidman or tom cruise however this movie is wonderful great story great characters the only reason i didn t give this movie five stars is the ending i think it could have been better great movie overall
1,these cases are amazing i love them if i ever need to replace one of my dvds i always buy memorex dvd storage cases there the next best thing i think to the ones that come orignal with my store bought dvds thanks memorex

1,i loved it and to prevent my hand slip from dry hands anyone who are crazy over that color
1,these javoscreen treo protectors are really very different from anything you ve normally seen typically of the screen protectors are that very thin material that you stick on the screen hope against hope that you don t have bubbles but you almost always do when the screen is off you see the bubbles thankfully when the screen is on the bubbles are pretty invisible but these javoscreen protectors are a completely different animal they are thick and tough and relatively firm and because of those properties they go on with no bubbles and they are easily moveable adjustable should you not get it on perfectly the first time further they come with a little squeegee thingy to make sure its on there good this is the state of the art for screen protectors and this all becomes an even bigger issue for men because of whiskers over time the screen will get dulled and scratched because of the thickness and quality of these scratches to the screen are no longer an issue
0,if you liked whyte s previous sophomoric efforts you ll love this in addition to being the same dumb hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books this one has the additional feeling of being pure filler in no real way does the story get advanced arthur begins as a baby and ends as a small boy there are adventures but nothing important happens as usual in whyte s books the bad guys are left alive so they can sneak up and do new evil and as usual the bad guys are pure plot devices and in no way characters with all the totally ahistorical democratic rhetoric merlin s brother shows up out of nowhere and they immediately hand him half the power in camelot anyone who would read this i guess has already read the previous lame offerings in this series and doesn t object to laughably boring plots which rely heavily on coincidence caricatures who never grow or change and historical detail that sounds like it comes from a museum brochure rather than any real scholarship so go for it but please if you want something exciting that will also make you think look at the really good arthurian efforts out there gillian brandshaw a a attanasio or barbara taylor bradford to name just a very few
1,ever since i returned from spain i have been looking for some decent anchovies to eat as tapas these are just the right amount for a snack and the flavor is wonderful if you have never eaten anchovies except on a pizza you are missing a great treat i highly recommend these and even if you only eat them occasionally they will remain fresh in the glass jars
0,judging from the picture i thought this thing looked like a turban it actually has no wrapped fabric but is a firmly fitting cap hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap aside from this the coloring is too bold old glory will select random coloration for each customer but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture i don t see how i can wear it without attracting stares
1,the firms super body sculpt is a mins parts workout which is broken up into upper body lower body and abs each segment has its own warmup and cool down it can be performed one segment at a time or all together for a complete total body workout the upper body flies by quickly with pushups lat rows and french presses and biceps the lower body section focuses a little too much on squats and by the end of your last leg press exercise there are more squats that will make you want to scream enough i found the abs section too short and not enough emphasis on crunches and too much on obliques the stablization exercises are a great bonus to this dvd and are my favourite overall it is very well instructed you can pyramid up the weights if you are strong enough especcially during leg presses and squats i usually do all three segments to get the full benefits i need and this dvd is great as a beginners tool to a firm body
1,keeps perfect time and looks great on the outdoor wall of my patio a classy looking clock
1,i purchased the axion frame for my wife to replace a defective polaroid frame from a different source the axion stacked up quite nicely to the other more expensive frame the axion is viewable from more angles than the polaroid frame with a cheaper price tag quality of the display is better on the axion and we have not had any technical issues pros brightness control color and contrast of display ease of setup and operation good sound from speakers on music playback cons slide show transitions are from top to bottom only different transitions would be a nice feature remote does not control volume of music overall the advantages of this frame outweigh the disadvantages we have been very happy overall with this purchase
0,i was really looking forward to reading this book since i am both a brain researcher and a professional musician first it was highly disorganized and rambled from subject to subject without any real framework much of what the author spoke of was not related to how the brain processes music but speaks to the way research is conducted even this was sparse at best he attempted to explain the elements of music so that the majority of people could understand it however it became too watered down and even lost me lastly the author was entirely too self congradulatory as to his own accomplishments pushing the envelope of science should be award enough for these reasons i can not recommend this book
1,this is an essential collection for every al pacino fan in carlitos way and scarface he does one of his best work ever then there is the performance that gave him his only oscar so far in a scent of a woman if you enjoy really good films with a good script and cast you should buy the al pacino collection

0,we ve had a number of gazillion bubble machines the first this one with an upright rotating set of bubble wands worked relatively well but stopped working after maybe a dozen uses granted one of those uses was for a few hours when the level of liquid is low the machine stops making bubbles since it has to pick up enough liquid to cover the wand we replaced it the next year with the typhoon machine this was awesome produced a huge quantity of bubbles and worked more reliably since the bubble liquid is sucked up and put on the wands no matter how low the supply of liquid it has a large reservoir at the bottom so you don t need to fill it very often it takes a lot of liquid though our issue now is getting the liquid gazillion liquid does produce the best bubbles they last well etc etc etc however very few stores stock the liquid and except for when i first bought the first machine no one stocks large size bottles even the online vendors like toys com who are supposed to have them never have them in stock i ve been on their notify list for a long time i ve ended up buying from someone in canada on ebay otherwise buying the smaller bottles at toysrus target etc is just too expensive both of these machines don t really work if you try other bubble liquids other liquids especially the cheaper kinds in very large size bottles are much thinner and the liquid drips right off the wands before it has a chance to pass by the blower part to make any bubbles we re planning to start making our own bubble liquid and hopefully that will cover us otherwise the machines are useless now
1,when i was a kid i religiously read many of the marvel comics the avengers was one of my favorites in my dreams i would have loved to have read all of the issues but the expense would have been way too much now after so many years the opportunity is finally here i was afraid that my youth would be too far removed to enjoy reading these anymore but i took a chance and bought this dvd anyway it was worth it by a mile i am enjoying reading each and every issue since the famed as much as i would have as a kid it will take a long time to get through them all but i ll enjoy every minute stan lee thank you for such a simple pleasure great stuff for kids of all ages

0,i took a chance on these shorts sight unseen and unfortunately i gave them away after trying them on the fabric is some sort of icky synthetic and feels terrible
0,after miles of moderate usage average at fairly low resistance for minutes daily a piece of metal snapped on one of the arms rendering the trainer inoperable unfortunately this was considered a wear item and was not warrantied by the manufacturer since the elliptical was used very lightly perhaps miles max during the first year of purchase warranty period i put the majority of mileage on the machine over the past four months and while it was great for burning calories i never really felt that it was a quality piece of equipment it appears that the manufacturer knows what parts of the frame are likely to break first and conveniently labels these wear items thus making repair expensive and difficult this is in spite of the fact that the piece that broke was a non moving load bearing support piece seems a little fishy to me throughout the life of the machine i was constantly tightening bolts to fix the popping and banging sounds that occurred after moderate use and observed that the wheels would often attempt to jump out of the tracks with heavier use after about miles i noted that the wheels were leaving large greyish streaks in the tracks from where they were wearing down against imperfections in the track surface i believe this was also partly due to too much play in the interaction of the wheels and tracks allowing the wheels to jump the tracks a little which each revolution this machine does not feel very sturdy and throughout the last month of its very short life gave me a creepy sense of impending doom whenever i used it somehow i knew it was about to break and unfortunately it did my hunch was real enough that i began shopping for a replacement several weeks ago please shop around i would not recommend this machine for people looking for a moderate to high intensity workout but it may be fine for slower walking or jogging paced routines that place less stress on the machine s mechanical components if you are an infrequent user this model may be ok but if you plan on using it every day i would recommend that you keep on looking note that my machine was a which at the time of purchase differed from the primarily in the computer and heart rate monitoring the frame is identical in the and which appears to be no longer sold since the problems with my machine were directly related to body construction they are appropriate for a review of the unless the manufacturer has made major improvements the problems i experienced are likely to still occur visual inspection of the pictures here leads me to believe that no major changes have been made to the frame construction
0,i work in the cosmetics industry beware this is a copy not a real mac lipstick not even close to the formula or color of moxie
1,had i read these reviews before buying this i probably wouldn t have purchased it but i had been looking at the much more expensive sonicare toothbrushes after my dentist recommended sonicare after i asked i didn t ask if there was a certain model that he recommended so i assumed i d have to pay from for a sonicare when i saw this one for at target i figured i didn t have much to lose i ve had no problems with any of the other problems mentioned and have been happy with how it makes my teeth feel super clean and has even cleaned this spot that even my dental hygienist couldn t get it turns off automatically after minutes so i know that i m brushing my teeth longer one thing that takes getting used to is not removing it while it s going you ll splatter toothpaste all over yourself d another plus is not having your tummy jiggle like it does with a manual toothbrush the only negative is that it goes thru aa batteries about once a month but the directions said that it lasts about brushes per battery change and that s about right i ve started using rechargable batteries and have had no problems
0,i bought this hoping it would be a cheap and easy way to do crunches in the living room while watching tv i wondered how the thing worked since the pictures and blurb are less than descriptive what it boils down to is that this is a foot hook tied to a bar with a nylon strap the nylon strap is cheap and appears that it will wear quickly the idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit ups crunches the problem is that the nylon strap doesn t actually hold your feet down i wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room negative on both accounts you need a good sturdy door to implement this product and then it still doesn t truly hold your feet down looks like i ll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down
1,i have tried every shampoo and conditioner on the market and was dissatisfied with the results until trying this combo my curls are well formed and bouncy and i use less styling product plus this line smells great it has a light citrusy smell that i wish they d bottle into perfume i even got my boyfriend who has curly hair like mine to buy and use these products by letting him sample mine i am hooked
1,it seems the last few office releases i have purchased haven t really offered anything different but this one does the interface is totally changed and takes some getting used to i would suggest upgrading to office when you have a little time to figure out the new layout and not if you have to jump right into a project the new toolbars seem to be really thought out and are very user friendly if you aren t into change and prefer the status quo of the standard file edit tools layout then this product is not for you if you are willing to spend a couple hours getting used the new layout it s quite easy you won t be sorry because it s well worth it
0,once again probably a great product but since i never received it i can not give it a fair rating
0,this is very bad doesnot work and really interfers with other programs almost impossible to remove it
1,this mattifying moisturizer is great it definitely helps with my oily skin and works all day long i can t say more than enough positive effects this moisturizer has had on m
1,this is a good tool does the job well and serves the purpose but is a little overpriced and canon keeps changing connectors forcing us to buy new accessories which is a wrong practice against the consumer i give a star because of canon not because of the product if you are willing to pay for it it s a good product
0,this product states toothbrushes that is incorrect it only holds this product also states aa batteries or ac adapter that is also incorrect you cannot use aa i felt that was misleading and unfortunately unless to me if those things don t bother you it might be what you are looking for but since it does bother me i never even tried it

0,battery is way overpriced contact battery store near you i did and found this same exact battery type batteries for much less while there they told me i could use a low amp deep cycle battery instead it did take some time wiring fused link is a must but is well worth it lasts all day and you can charge it at a amp trickle charge with a amp selectable car battery charger all told it cost me less than for everything it now longer just takes up space

1,i put a great deal of interest in my purchases with a lot of extra down time at work and an internet connection i find myself reviewing everything before i buy it and only after i am very impressed and convinced by many positive reviews will i take out my credit card but this product the microsoft media remote was one exception having read many bad reviews and deciding to purchase it anyway let me tell you this remote is perfect if you would like one easy to use remote to control both basic tv and an xbox that doubles as your dvd player the only buttons you would need for the tv are channels volume tv speaker output control only numerical channel input muting intput selection yes it can switch between your tv s inputs return to toggle between tv channels and power you do not need specialized advanced buttons found on a oem remote or advanced learning remote for the tv you do not need to control a a v receiver dvd player other than xbox or a digital cable box tivo dvr etc you are on a budget but would still like a quality remote if you can say yes to all or most then don t hesitate to grab one of these remotes you will be completely satisfied especially with immediate access to the tactile dvd buttons versus the s annoying on screen dvd navigation for this feature it is almost worth the alone p s i also own a logitech harmony for the living room which i highly recommend for anyone not fitting into the catagory mentioned above
1,science matters you already know that you want to stay on top of what s happening in medicine space research earth studies and more that s because you know things like aids earthquakes and changing weather patterns all have huge significance to human needs and social policy but you don t have the time or the specialized knowledge to plow through piles of academic journals every week hunting the nuggets that mean the most and translating them into the language of normal educated reader you want science news it s brief and readable so you don t have to dedicate half your week to keeping up with what really matters it s weekly which matters in a world where month old news is old news and it s written so that any concerned citizen can understand the science and the issues the editors don t write down to the readers but they don t assume specialized education either intelligent high schoolers or precocious tween agers can grasp the important parts of each story but specialists including one university prof i know use it to keep up with news outside of their research areas try a few issues at your local library you ll probably find that you ll want your own wiredweir
1,raglan and cap sleeve makes it more edgy than wearing a plain old t shirt good quality for the price i usually wear a medium but ordered the xl and it s a good fit fitted but not too tight
0,this novel about a community in some desert village is written with the simplicity of language that one associates with old myths and underlying the story are indeed echoes sometimes close and sometimes rather distorted of ancient myths god is allegorized as gabalawi the remote and mostly unseen owner of the estate of which the children of the alley are supposed to be his heirs the central character in each of the five stories is up against the selfish and oppressive overseers who dominate the estate and its inhabitants with the help of their retinue of gangsters the first of the stories evokes that of the expulsion from the garden of eden and the story of cain and abel the second that of moses and pharaoh the third that of jesus the fourth that of muhammad then there is a fifth story in which the central figure a magician is presumably a scientist he tries to discover the secret of gabalawi he fails to find it but in the process he is instrumental in the death of gabalawi who had been easier to kill than to see it makes no difference the scientist who has invented a weapon of great destructive power is forced to put it at the service of the new overseer and the children of the alley remain as oppressed as ever though they remain hopeful that one day magic will put an end to their suffering subtle the book is not either in content or in style and in my view is far too long and far too repetitive the overseers and the gangsters in each generation have different names but as individuals they are indistinguishable one from another a large number of the characters are perpetually angry or violent they mostly shout scream shriek yell cry or sneer which becomes rather tiresome the literary quality of this novel is i think greatly inferior to mahfouz s rightly famous cairo trilogy which has contributed to his having become the only arab to have been awarded the nobel prize for literature but it is a courageous book for an egyptian to have written it has been banned in egypt its allegories enraged the islamicists and led to an attempt on the author s life
1,i bought these earrings for my stepmother in seattle so i never actually saw them now she is a refined person with classy taste so you can t just get her any piece of junk she said they were perfect and she loved them that s a great recommendation

0,because of tummy troubles my doctor ordered me on a very bland diet well this stuff is just what the doctor ordered as it is almost completely tasteless i can t give it a one star which qualifies as hating it as i can t hate anything that has pasta as one of the ingredients but it is not good it makes kraft mac and cheese seem very exciting i would not reorder and would fear ordering anything else from annie s this would only be for young children who hate anything with a taste to it

0,i like the idea of all this in one case and it s hard to complain at this price but some of these things would be better bought separately we ve either traded up or found a substitute for most of the things in here here s what i found item the case is fine but things do fall out all the time i haven t used the tweezers yet but the magnifying part sounds nice the nail clippers were way too sharp we cut my daughter s skin more than once but one was serious enough that we considered a hospital trip now we use my regular clippers and i haven t gotten her skin since the soft grip thing actually make them slide around more so it was tougher to cut where you wanted to trust me it s easy to clip skin on fingers that little the emery boards are very handy but any emery boards would work we got a different thermometer this one was too slow faster ones are more expensive but they re worth it for a sick squirmy baby i haven t used the medicine dropper but the one time she did need one i actually asked at the pharmacy desk at a grocery store and they gave me one for free then later i found out we had this one the brush and comb are nice i m sure they can be purchased separately from the kit for less my daughter s only months old and has no need for a toothbrush for awhile since there are no teeth and even when there are i believe you wipe them with gauze not a toothbrush for awhile basically although this kit had tons of things that could be helpful and it wasn t very expensive we have either gotten an upgrade on the things we use thermometer or have found other things that would work just as well regular nail clippers free medicine dropper i m certainly not saying that you shouldn t get one because i d hate to say that and then have you find that you needed it if you get it for a shower gift great if not you can find substitute items just as easily

1,i recently recieved my new camera and i am thrilled i have been researching which camera to buy since december when our last camera went capoot there have been mixed reviews for the olympus sw series but could not resist the appeal of this camera s unique features i cannot wait to take it into the pool this summer with the kids so far the point and shoot options and pictures have been lovely any person can screw up pictures with any camera but this camera has so many features to avoid that my husband and i had a wonderful time taking extreme close up shots of our garden i have not seen that quality and had that much satisfaction from a camera since we first switched over to digital i am very pleased to say the least with this purchase

1,i ve had the hippo faucet cover for over six months and i think it s great my son is always sitting near the faucet and this definitely prevents him from getting hurt it is a little bit of a pain to take off if you need to use the shower but otherwise i think it s worth it the only problem i found with the hippo cover is that it doesn t really dispense bubble bath well

1,man these things are good i used to eat pop tarts all the time but it eventually got to the point that a i got tired of pop tarts and b they seemingly just stopped making them like they used to instead of being good and soft like they re supposed to be pop tarts morphed into hard pastries that felt and tasted like they had been left out in the air for a couple of days these new go tarts at least the frosted strawberry ones are just right soft pastries with just the right amount of strawberry inside them to give you that elusive strawberry twang taste some of you may know what i m talking about here these things are ready to eat right out of the pack so ready to eat in fact that there s a message on each package stating that you should not put them in a toaster or microwave if you re the daredevil sort and insist on breaking kellogg s prescribed rules i can t stop you but don t blame me if your microwave explodes or something of course one little oz bar isn t enough for anyone bigger than a chihuahua puppy so volume is an important factor here which is where these multi pack boxes come in so handy with calories per bar i don t guess these things will be making any of jenny craig s diet plans any time soon but i say life s too short eat all you want and with these individually wrapped bars you won t face the classic pop tart dilemma of having to choose between eating two pastries now or putting one back in the box knowing that it will taste even more stale later because you ve already freed it from its freshness preserving little tinfoil wrapper thingy

0,i purchased this item for my son s birthday not well built as it needed lots of tape to keep it together and readjustments after each attempt to fly it also appears to need the wind just right and thrown a certain way in order for it to fly after a couple of days we were able to accomplish only one min successful flight on the second day after mins of recharging the battery the battery case and wires melted have contacted company for a refund

0,i m in charge of a weekly touch football game where we use an official nfl football from a previous year and i wanted to get another one for backup i know the duke is supposed to be the official nfl ball from this year but there seems to be something wrong with the balls amazon is shipping the first ball i got from amazon was hard as a rock slick as all get out and had poor stitching in the laces i got a second one and the stitching was a bit better but it was still hard and slippery and when it was exposed to rain the ball stained the hands of everyone who touched it with red coloring i have no clue if that s to be expected or not since it s all leather but it seems odd in any case you can grip the ball with a good pair of sticky football gloves which also help mitigate the pain of catching the ball so it is usable and throws a nice spiral but maybe i play ball with a bunch of wussies cuz no one else wants to get near that thing out of fear of breaking their hands which is kind of annoying given how much i paid for the balls maybe the footballs just need to be broken in but i m not really sure how to do that aside from playing with them which no one seems to want to do i ve tried to let some air out to make the things more user friendly but it doesn t really help anyway i find it really hard to believe this is the ball the nfl played with this year something about them just seems cheaply made in any case i suggest you save some money and go with a decent composite leather ball
1,this disk collects the two tales from the crypt movies on one side of a single disk for some reason the menu has the second movie listed first in the first movie billy zane is excellent as a demon looking for a final key so that the demons can retake the universe this is the story of his battle with the current demon knight the protector of the key wonderfully crafted and dark the second movie bordello of blood is a more tongue in cheek t a fest and lacks the dark seriousness of the first lilith the queen of all vampires has been awakened she can be controlled by a key the one from the first movie she has set up a bordello to lure victims to her hunger dennis miller is his wise cracking self as he portrays a down and out private investigator looking for a missing person it is nice not to have to flip the disk over or insert a new disk but there is no room for real extras we do get the original trailers seeing the two films together really showcases the extreme difference between the two the first is dark well written and well acted the second is gratuitous crass and just not quite as good although it is fun in its own way now they are together at a reasonable price
1,the best weekly news magazine on the market time also gives science and technology updates movie reviews some celeb news and provocative articles on world trends well worth a subscription especially if you don t have time for the nightly new
0,this movie is so bad it is just about a annoying valley girl blonde who is rich and has tons of friends and who has no real problems the only people who like this movie are the ones who wished they were the main character a pea brained airheaded ditz who has no redeeming qualities the movie tries hard to invent new teen speak with tons of lame catch phrases that unfortunately caught on with some unpopular kids who liked the movie so much they tried to sound like the shallow empty headed spoiled main characters even though most of the movie s fans live the life nowhere close to cher s and look nothing like her but they want to pretend the movie hits you with these lame catch phrases every seconds desprate to beat you over the head with them in the movie the main character cher thinks she is too good for the boys in her high school but then she ends up with someone who is pratically a relative to her nasty she is really arrogant for someone whose realtionship should be jerry springer she s supposed to be a posh valley girl but at the end she s like ella may clampet going after jethro when all her resources for finding a man runs out
1,always loved this group own several of their cd s and this is by far my favorite darryl hall s phrasing of his songs are superb
0,i know that as a wolf lover i am a bit biased but i would still like to say that this book is stupid and incorrect you see in this story three children are left alone a wolf disguised as their grandmother tricks them into letting him in because he wants to eat them unfortunately that s where this seemingly charming book starts going downhill this is just another stupid book that summed up says wolves are evil ugly beasts who attack people we have to kill them all before they gorge themselves on our children yep the wolf is depicted as evil in this book why couldn t they make it something that actually hurts people like a bear or a mountain lion ignorance that s why the wolf is also depicted as stupid and easy to trick in this book see near the end the children try to trick the wolf by telling him he can become immortal by eating gingko nuts they plan on luring him into their trap to get rid of him the wolf instantly falls for it which is lame wolves are among the most intelligent and perceptive animals on earth it s practically traditional to make children s books with wolves as villains and the chinese seem to loath wolves but this book crosses the line don t let your kids read it unless you want them to think wolves are savage stupid man eating beasts if they already think so you d be neglecting mankind s need to know things even more by letting them read it in other words it s a terrible book
1,we have an original hatteras rope hammack which we purchased when we lived in north carolina i love it but the rope tends to stretch too much and requires rehanging to tighten it we were informed that it would when we purchased it four years ago but now it seems to be more work than it is worth the solid quilted design seems like it would be better and would require less maintenance also our poodle mix pet just loves it she would try to jump in before we could even get it hanged we had to attach a cover to it to keep her paws from going through the ropes so that adds to the value of the solid design thanks for listening to me and we plan on purchasing the guilted hammack as soon as possible

1,i rented contact from gamefly and played it for a few days before deciding that i am going to purchase it in the not too distant future unfortunately gamefly does not rent games along with instruction manuals so i had to learn everything in game by trial and error even so i was doing pretty well if i do say so myself and had to stop myself from playing anymore so i wouldn t waste the purchase later it reminded me of other rpg type games i ve played in the past such as nes original zelda if you liked zelda you ll probably like this game but buy it or borrow from a friend who ll loan you the manual too to have that help may make all the difference
1,these are true tales from a clinical neurologist s notebook but this isn t just any neurologist oliver sacks author of the justly celebrated the man who mistook his wife for a hat and awakenings which was later made into a movie starring robert deniro and robin williams and other works is a gifted writer with a fine sense of story and an even finer sense of humanity he has a style that is both affecting and fascinating yet studiously objective a style laced with footnotes and clinical observations historical comparisons and wisdom part of the power of these tales and of all of sacks s work is his ability to be totally engaged and to identify with the subject while part of him is off to the side observing with scientific impartiality this makes for a compelling read if you ve never read sacks before you are in for a very special treat these tales are paradoxical because defects disorders diseases can bring out latent powers developments evolutions forms of life that might never be seen or even be imaginable in their absence it is this creative potential that forms the central theme of this book from sacks s preface page xvi the first tale the case of the colorblind painter is about a successful artist who worked in color all his life only to became colorblind at age sixty five and the effect this had on his life and work the second the last hippie is about an amnesiac man with a frontal lobe tumor that left him stranded in the sixties sacks tells this sad pathetic story with vivid detail and characteristically ends it with a footnote a footnote of such warmth and genuine identification that we are moved to tears don t skip the footnotes the third tale a surgeon s life is an amazing account of a canadian surgeon with tourette s syndrome it is here that we begin to see the central theme of this book in brilliant illumination dr carl bennett riddled with the bizarre tics characteristic of the disorder compulsions that cause him to throw things to touch things again and again in a ritualistic manner to flail jump and jerk about nonetheless became a very successful and beloved doctor of surgery sacks scrubs up with dr bennett and goes into surgery with him during which miraculously the tics disappear for however long it takes to complete the surgery sacks visits him at home and meets his wife and two children sees the dents in the refrigerator and on the walls and comes away with a sense of how astounding the human potential to overcome adversity can be the fourth tale to see and not see is about partially restored sight and how it was not a blessing this sad story illustrates how sight is learned from infancy and is largely a constructive and interpretive function of the brain this tale also lets us see how the world of the sightless can be rich and fulfilling beyond our imagination in the fifth tale the landscape of his dreams we meet a gifted artist franco magnani who from memory alone recreates his home town of pontito italy through his paintings he has a nearly photographic three dimensional memory but because of a strange illness that befell him when he was thirty one he cares only to re create his pontito not the people or events but the houses the masonry the stones and he does so continually with microscopic and affecting detail the chapter prodigies focuses on an autistic artist stephen wiltshire whom sacks is determined to befriend and understand in this tale and the concluding tale an anthropologist on mars sacks helps us to penetrate the world of the autistic and see it at least in my interpretation as an alternate view of reality a view with its own strengths and weaknesses a world that is just as true and valid as the normal one of course severe autism is debilitating in the extreme and even modest autism can permanently scar and alienate the autistic from society yet perhaps that is society s loss i even got the sense in reading these concluding stories about autism that perhaps theirs is an evolutionary strategy trying to emerge that is a different way of seeing and dealing with the world that also might work i would not be shocked to discover some day that the autistic with their sometimes extraordinary gifts of memory and concentration are melded more completely and seamlessly into our usual consciousness and that humankind is the better for it incidentally the last tale about temple grandin who is a professor of animal studies at colorado state university is remarkable because it is about an autistic who is completely integrated into the society yet remains autistic she is the one who says she sometimes feels because of her different perspective like an anthropologist on mars when she views normal people sacks allows us to see why bottom line this is an extraordinary book of insight and scholarship about the human condition written with grace and a deep sense of humanity not to be missed
1,fits great quality great sale price if your lucky you don t get what you pay for
0,i had heard of the importance and significance of the education of henry adams for a long time i finally determined i needed to read it i acutally read it twice and found less in it the second time than the first i am sorry i missed the greatness of this book i am sure there was something wrong with me but i found it to be incredibly unimpressive perhaps this came from the fact that henry adams was not a likeable man he was famous for holding court in his home near the white house and making caustic and negative comments about every president who lived there granted he lived in washington at a time when there were plenty of second rate occupants of the white house but the thought of people wasting their time trying to please a blue blooded snob like adams depresses me why did anyone bother he lived in an atmosphere of snobbery sharp tongues clever remarks and brilliant conversation the world went on without him truth be told and he contributed less than the people who walked by his house each day he was a very good historian in his time but who reads his books now not very many in short his own work was not as long lasting as he would have wanted it to be maybe the influence of some of the presidents he mocked lasted longer than the published and purchased work of henry adams the education of henry adams does not have much real information he got education in one place none in others surely the suicide of his wife provided some very painful education for henry but he wrote nothing about it in his book when eric sevareid wrote not so wild a dream it was compared to the education of henry adams that was meant as a compliment oddly i think sevareid s book is much much better sevareid wrote of america the common man the war and what it all meant to him adams needed to get out more he did not see america not the america built by the common citizen who put it all together and defended it i gained a trememdous amount from sevareid i cannot say the same for the work of henry adams again a lot of this might be me perhaps i read the book at a bad time maybe i needed to read it a third time i do not know i do know i do not think this is a great american classic forgive please my ignorance

0,somehow we ended up with no less than three strollers a nice zooper wheel outdoors stroller a maclaren umbrella stroller and in the middle this red peg perego aria stroller we have had nothing but bad news with this aria stroller what a clunker as an italian i am ashamed to say this confirms to me the stereotype that they can make nothing that works but everything looks fabulous i am only being slightly facetious this stroller is very sleek and stylish and light weight but that is where it all ends the biggest flaw is the poor handling wheels pushing and steering is a constant battle sometimes it just doesn t want to go i have really tried to inspect where the problem is and it does not look like the wheels stick rather the whole body seems to flex too much when you push the stroller just gently rock the stroller side to side and you can see what i mean other nits include the aria stickers coming loose and eventually needing to be torn off and the baby s cup holder being both too shallow and too easily removable but the biggest problem is the handling it is not pleasant and we never use it anymore
0,i have been using this product for about a month and all it s done is given me puffy eyes there is no proof that this product works at all and the fda has even written the makers of this product a warning letter to stop making false claims that it helps stretch marks and wrinkles i ve used botox before and believe me botox works this product doesn t so obviously it s not better than botox i bet the people who gave it stars either work for the company or are fictional entities created by the basic research marketing department so that the product seems better than it actually is
0,this is another hollywood costume epic they spared no expense with the set and costumes hired talented big name actors rex harrison liz taylor and richard burton despite the resources committed to this film sadly the film was more stylistic than substantive harrison was terrific as gaius julius caesar but he is only in the first half of the movie and richard burton does not come across as a great mark antony his character is weak willed and he is harassed and henpecked by cleopatra antony was passionate and reckless but henpecked although the film is titled cleopatra it focuses more on the historic events the film also reduces cleopatra to the woman depicted in octavian s propaganda rather than portraying the real multi dimensional woman who was intelligent a gifted political strategist expert linguist dynamic personality and who ironically was not a beauty they don t give you sense of what was so compelling about cleopatra she is depicted as a combative shrew with both caesar and antony i doubt constant conflict would have gotten far with either man if you took away her looks would either man have been attracted to the personality portrayed here i would think not especially considering both their backgrounds as roman military leaders and the weak position of egypt compared to rome given the limitations of their vision of cleopatra liz taylor was perfect choice to cast as the selfish beautiful seductive and glamorous temptress she really breathes life into this character and gives a great performance although a portrayal of the real person would have been much more interesting you can t deny taylor s appeal and she does a great job considering the limits of the material although taylor shines sadly we never get to know cleopatra her depth managed to get lost in this oversexed hollywood costume drama this movie was lush eye candy without a whole lot of substance in fairness to this project it fits in with similar epics of the s and sixties the style reminds me of demille films like the ten commandments it did capture the public imagination because it launched the relationship of taylor and burton and ultimately despite its issues and because of their star power it turned a profit the research writing and the directors vision should have each contributed to creating a great film instead it produced this mediocre costume drama the real shame is that in the hands of someone with a vision and a passion for the subject matter it could have been great

0,a book full of heartwarming stories from country stars singers writers and listeners or so the back of the book said as i read some sentimental stories and some down right boring stories i questioned how more than half of these stories got into the edition of the chicken soup series i loved about three stories liked about ten and was puzzled by all the other entries
1,parents the content in this game seems absolutally fine for anyone roughly ten and up the only reason i see it as rated teen is because this game requires a good bit of hand eye cordination sometimes aslo the hulk roaring might get to little kids who are still around the age where they still come up to you in the middle of the night to check there closets for monsters but basicly if your kids can handel action cartoons like ninja turtles and justice league they deffinately can handel this game anyways i wasn t sure about this game when i picked it up i don t know why i hadn t heard much about it and i hadn t played many comic book based games besides the spiderman based one on the playstation but i didn t see many other games at the rental store the kids could play on my xbox so i rented it out to see if it was okay it is in my opinion an absolutaly great game for almost anyone the entire game was like a digital stress ball for me you get to rampage to your hearts desire i spent a few hours alone that week just ignoring the story chapters completely and just wrecking the huge city and desert military bases to game takes place in kids would also love it for the same reason they build lego houses and then smash them to bits with their action figures the story is a bit odd if you don t know much about the hulk already as it revolves around bruces quest for a cure in order to stop a second more evil and cunning hulk bruce banner discoverted growing inside him appropriatly named the devil hulk the big green savage hulk we all know and love also doesn t like the devil hulk moving in to banner s mind so it becomes more agreeable to suconicous orders banner uses to get the child like brute to do what he wants meanwhile a new baddie called the abomination appears after one of the military general stupidly trys to recover one of bruce s failed cure attempts in the very begining of the game all in all the story is okay as you go on but you can tell they tried to stuff several comicbooks basic ideas into a game story only as an excuse to callenge you with bosses and other unique situations as far a gameplay goes it s fantasic the more damage you cause the more smash points you earn and the more moves you can buy later too continue your assult on just about everything there are mini games and secrets everywhere to earn even more smash points with in fact the only thing that s missing is a co op or two player mode as far as replayability goes it s always there anyway i would recommended this game to a anyone who has kids roughly around ten b anyone who likes third person single player games and c anyone one who has been stress out at work one too many times or feels like throwing a temper tantrum
0,they tell you tha this product holds batteries and works with the s battery grip but when i received the item it is for a completely different product and does not work with the s bg grip it has the product name of cpm just as stated but it accepts aaa batteries and doesn t even come close to working with the bg
1,both bags that i received were quite tender and had great flavor not too sweet and not too spicy i will definately be ordering some more my dog mr doodles also loves it
1,this one came out in its one of the very few albums that included the almighty joe preston on bass one of the great things about this cd is that all the songs are all on one track so it forces you to listen to this long winding sludgefest in its entirety as most melvins fans know this along with houdini was the pinacle of their musical career after this they made some great albums and some good ones but never better than their self titled album previously titled lysol but they decided to change it once they were threatened with a lawsuit it would be ultra cool if ipecac records would give this album a deluxe re issue treatment it definitely deserves it
1,i am so passionate about this book it has answered all the life questions i have ever held although many people i have recommended it to have reported that they have not been able to get into it for me i would say it is the best book i have ever read this is about the copy i have purchased because when i lend it out somehow it is not returned and i want to have a copy to re read every now and then i will not be lending this one again

0,my family received this magazine for years but recently we have decided not to re new our subscription this used to be a quality product but it has recently gone downhill with the inclusion of more and more advertising in each issue at this point nearly half of the magazine consists of advertisements this isn t the real science magazine it claims to be and is a waste of money the content is not all that great the articles are often extremely short too short for even a pre teen audience my kids often wished that this magazine included more serious science topics and not just shortened dumbed down material much of the magazine is full of fluff things like word searches and picture matching games which didn t interest my children the content might be okay for year olds and children at slightly lower reading levels but older children will be bored all in all i d recommend that you simply get the regular adult version of national geographic though the articles might be too complex for children the pictures will make up for what they can t read if you re looking for more of a children s oriented magazine you re better off with muse a high quality general science magazine that is published by the smithsonian museum in washington dc however muse caters to a slightly older audience perhaps ages and up
1,one whiff of this delicious soap and you are transported to a land of pine trees where plates of freshly sliced oranges are served on a bed of lemongrass surrounded by patchouli candles this is the best way i can describe the scent that seems to awaken from the night and mingle with memories of exotic honey and wide open skies i am not sure where i go when i inhale deeply but i am no longer in the shower follow this with the skin sin lotion and you will enter a little bit of heaven on earth also delicious to use in a bath with sea salts and patchouli orange slices optional but you might crave the taste of oranges while using this soap the rebecca review
0,these are excellent graham crackers we love em and the kids do too and it s not often that we agree but you ll be sorry if you order graham crackers or any other food that can be damaged in shipping from amazon our recent order arrived in the original box from the factory containing boxes of new morning honey grahams that was it no packing material nothing to shield the crackers from the drops and shocks of being shipped to us so we didn t get graham crackers we got graham crumbs and a few graham cracker fragments by all means order these crackers just don t order them from amazon instead find a retailer that knows how to do it right or buy them from your local grocery unless you really want graham cracker crumbs
1,america s test kitchen rated it number one so i decided to try one for myself i have owned grill brushes from home depot online catalog sellers etceteras the bristles regardless of material on these brushes end up shedding over time or if not they crush down and become nearly worthless the grill wizard eliminates these problems by using a replaceable pad the pad works great i m still on my first pad and have used it probably times or more already it s a good product and i highly recommend it

0,i love most jack links jerky products however i was disappointed with this product though it had all the heat the flavor was lacking true pepper taste it tasted like a bunch of powdered old hot spices not a true fresh pepper cure i think the mistake most people make with hot peppers is not removing the seeds before using as this can give a bitter as well as hot taste i have not given up on jack links just ordered their turkey jerky

1,i purchased the extention kit for the superyard xt play gate to go with the play gate that i purchased it works great for my new pomeranian puppies the play yard is wonderful for keeping the puppies all in one place and knowing that they are safe it will also be nice to pick up and take outside as the weather improves the fact that is is portable makes it nice to pick up and take it as we travel so i can still provide a safe place for them where ever we happen to be i love this item and i am very happy i purchased it i feel the gate is great for animals i have not used it with children as of this time
1,more than anything else alan furst recreates the atmosphere of the early days of world war ii espionage i a serebin inhabits the urbane world of russian emigres in the europe of mainly in paris but also in roumania serebin is recruited into what seems to be the british secret service and seeks to interrupt the flow of roumanian oil to the nazi war machine the whole operation reeks of amateurism appropriate enough at that stage of the war brainy careful daring but amateur with one exception none of the players know completely what they are part of which also leaves the reader at times groping for the story line still furst s prose forms the characters into full dimensional beings from bogart s casablanca or graham greene s human factor highly recommended for readers with an interest in espionage or ww ii
0,eric maibus and scott bairstow have become fine young actors and even their adequate performances cannot save this dismal pointless lurid and sadistic movie dee wallace stone should be ashamed for participating maibus plays the hypnotic leader of a teenage devil cult with no conscience morals or regard for anyone but himself bairstow plays the usual misunderstood teen who looks to the group for acceptance the script is laden with offensive four letter words in every other sentence enough is enough if this is the way teens talk then steer me clear folks there is no heart or soul in this movie and no reason to rent or buy no stars c mon amazon when you gonna give us the stars options
1,this is the third dvd from shawn trautman that i have gotten swing and cha cha are the others and they are all exceedingly well done they start from ground zero and progress in very small steps that are a snap to follow by the time it s over you will understand the logic behind the dance and know enough to do well on a social dance floor it will also get you pumped to learned more advanced steps you won t feel intimidated i highly recommend it

1,my family all enjoys this product the taste is good very little aftertaste the product is healthy and excellent for a quick snack
0,i was very disapointed with the smoker cover it is made of a very thin plastic that is simular to a medium guage garbage bag material this type of cover needs to be able to be resistant to some heat weather and also some general scratching just taking the cover off requires real tender care or you will get a quick split in it the company needs if necessary to charge more for the cover and make it more durable sincerely yours allen vest iii
0,this accessory system does not fit my kohlcraft umbrella stroller i can find a place to put the parent cupholder but there is no place at all to put the child s snack tray the stroller will not close when it is attached anywhere on the stroller the whole purpose of spending the money on this system which was considerably more expensive than others in the store was for my child to have a snack tray therefore it s going back to the store there are plenty of other cup accessories out there that are far cheaper than this even the prince lionheart cupholder alone was very expensive the product itself is also very cheaply made the s hooks look so flimsy i wouldn t trust them again they sell thicker sturdier s hooks that look like they will work much better than this so that s what i ll purchase plus the parent cupholder is also extremely flimsy already the arms have fallen off several times and that was just moving it from the table to the kitchen counter thirdly i m not sure if it was the clips that came in my packet perhaps a defect or if they are all made this way but it is extremely difficult to get the screws into the clips and then they didn t fasten correctly no matter how i tried i worked on it for close to an hour and i consider myself pretty good at these things i could not get the clips to tighten properly they continued to be loose even with using the smaller screws perhaps my stroller tubing is too small very unlikely but it just might be the case this is going back to the store where i will purchase the insulated parent cupholder for a package of two thick s hooks for and my child will have to learn to deal with holding her snack cup and straw cup i will save myself a headache and backache from attempting to continue to get this on correctly and my child will get the added bonus of learning to be responsible for her own items do yourself a favor and don t bother with this product
0,kill meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee this movie is the worst movie of all all all time since the history of the universe and before that in theaters i was the only one watching that movie and i felt like walking out i wanted to cry the actors stink along with the plot and d effects all i can say is boooooooooo this movie sucks
0,i loved it the first months i had it with out notice the cable shredded i called and emailed and nobody at the company got back with me it seem that the inside of the wheel was rough and began tearing it the customer service is bad and so was the product
1,it is basically a short review of the great book written by zahn i recommend the novel and this as a refresher for later times
1,for me happy has a subtley orange undertone and evokes a sense of vibrancy and youth as with the signature female clinique scents you don t need much to cause a stir and it always leaves a lingering subtle trail of sophistication
0,i d give this machine stars if it wasn t so expensive and it wasn t so darn small it barely fits anything inside it works well for pacifiers and a rattle or two but that s about it anything else just won t fit and the design of the inside with the piece in the middle makes it even more restricting in my personal opinion this product is not worth the money i am so disappointed because it sounded so perfect but its just not
1,my mother in law bought these for my daughter at first i was skeptical about how entertaining they would be but my daughter took to them right away in the beginning she would just chew on them and smile at the quacking duck noise but now she interacts more and seems to love feeling all the different textures she also loves to knock them down when i stack them up they won t entertain her for hours but she s always thrilled to see them when i break them out for the first time that day
1,we loved this pair of sneakers for my mo old so much that we bought it in the next size up so that we he could keep using them they are so easy to get on him and we all know some are so difficult these slide right on while pulling the tongue they are also wide enough for his flinstone feet lol they break in well for flexibility too
1,i had previously seen wong kar wai s two most recent full length films in the mood for love and and enjoyed them greatly i just recently purchased the rest of his catalogue and have been viewing them in chronological order tonight i watched chungking express this film like all of his films deals with isolation loss and missed connections it contains two separate stories which on the surface are not related the first story i found to be intriguing though not really so inspiring the second which comprises the bulk of the film was simply amazing wkw really has a way of placing you into the emotions of his characters his is an extremely voyeuristic style to film making as the story progressed i started to feel uncomfortable as a result of one of the characters behavior then the discomfort gave way to exuberance and i was smiling and even laughing along with this character i began to sympathize and god forbid even condone what was happening when the character s game came to an end as it had to do i was scared for her but was relieved when her victim also sympathized and condoned her behavior then the story took a turn and it broke my heart in a most profound way wkw s stories always break my heart but this one really hurt in a more personal way i m not really sure why but after all the sadness and pain this story turned around and put the pieces back together beware this is not a film for mainstream junkies if you enjoy challenging and thought provoking movies then this is a definite must see if you have primarily subsisted on a diet of mainstream hollywood fare but are curious to see the treasures that are possible with daring film making then this movie is an excellent gateway drug
0,i cannot believe this is billed as a baby video the images have nothing to do with the music and give absolutely no learning or development value i personally like the baby miracle series of videos that give a great baby sized bible message while being very interactive with my baby
1,ramune is the japanese version lemonade and it is a really nice drink if you can get the glass ball to move away from the opening without spraying yourself with your drink if you have been sprayed once too often but love the taste perhaps you should try this candy i am pretty addicted to the stuff and eat them or at a time i enjoy just letting them sit in my mouth with that fizzy taste they really taste quite a lot like ramune should sucking on some ramune candy is nice way to pass time reading actually they are quite refreshing these candies are not hard and quite chewable for those who prefer that for anyone looking for a candy that is not over the top sweet give ramune soda candy a shot it is a nice candy and makes a great snack even the container looks like a ramune bottle
0,i bought this lens based on the super telephoto ability and low cost you truly get what you pay for and this thing isn t worth a plug nickel i took a few shots on a tripod and could not believe how terrible this lens was on a digital rebel xt incredibly soft even stopped down i would never want to make an enlargement from it stay away don t believe the fools who are novices you will be disappointed with this lens you re much better off to buy the older used the l version costs more too but both are so much better than this junker you re even more crazy if you think you can take decent photo s with this lens handheld having switched from nikon when switching to digital i almost judged canon from this one lens which i m glad i didn t don t waste your money or learn the hard way like i did this lens also had terrible purple fringing almost as bad as the kit after extensive research and testing i now own and am happy with the following canon lenses canon canon version canon non l version i will sell for the l version when i can afford it the kit makes usable shots but when i could afford it i sold it too you will get better results buying a rebel xt and an older than you would with a brand new xti and this terrible lens
0,terribly waxy chocolate pieces that all sunk to the bottom of the bowl while the flakes floated on top the flakes seem to have a chocolate flavoring added to enhance the experience but those disgusting chocolate pieces made me gag and i wondered what i was eating alone they were nearly tasteless and i ll never purchase again yuck
1,this magazine transports you to a different world every issue is a wish book with holiday cooking to plan over the upcoming month or crafts to do over your next long weekend or a bookcase to try to paint for a new room well in my life years go by and i dream on but just leafing through this magazine erases so many cramped negative angry thoughts i will never laugh at crafty people again i will also probably never actually accomplish anything so beautifully pictured inside but the dreams are sweet the expert information regarding vintage items and preservation alone is fascinating but then you have gardening cooking baking furniture decorating beading anything do it yourself martha is truly a wonder woman worth every cent
1,kiplinger s personal finance is a worthy challenge to money magazine for a monthly dose of economic and investing trends helpful financial tips and in kpf s case a kind of populist advocacy for the little guy investor i came to kpf by way of the well read hand me downs of one of kiplinger letters for which see elsewhere on that were pressed into my hands by my mother in law years ago she probably thought that without i d lead her daughter into the financial wilderness where we would thirst and die in good romantic fashion i eventually migrated up the kiplinger food chain to the glossier kpf and have never left much of the information provided by kpf mutual fund and etf results and the liek are widely available the same could be said of the investing advice look for no loads with low fees diversify don t bail under pressure where kpf excels is in the short articles and tips which have often prodded me to take money and or sanity saving moves two fine recent examples the articles in the september issue entitled buy a car on sale and things to ask about silk ties both of these articles provided solid input into two buying decisions i m likely to make in the new year what s more the conclusions reached by these two authors are probably not the ones you d anticipate in terms of marco economic instincts the kiplinger washington editors run bullish though not quite so much as money s more cosmopolitan posed writers kpf won t lure you into buying quite as many fancy gentleman s toys either a fact that is well observed by their authors who tend to be mutual fund companies rather than designer suit or german auto makers don t get me wrong i read other financial rags and might not be as enthusiastic about kpf if it were my only source but kpf s monthly arrival is still always welcomed as it has been for years it remains firmly entrenched in my top tier
1,i was reluctant to buy this after reading that it wasn t so great on fine hair but my son s hair was really getting shaggy and i was not going to wrestle with him at the barber shop again so i bought this and was so happy when it worked perfectly on his hair i used the inch guide for his whole head and he looks great the vacuum got all the hair which is a good thing because i cut his hair wherever he happen to be in the house he didn t have to stop what he was doing and sit still or wear a cape which he hates having his hair cut at home also allowed him to get familiar with the trimmer what it sounds like and feel like in his own time and environment he cut his stuffed bear s hair first then daddy s then his own by himself and then let me cut his what a relief to have a nice haircut and no kicking or screaming at it has already paid for itself i m so glad i bought it i didn t give it stars because it is pretty loud and had a really crappy users manual
1,first heard his stand up on cd when i worked at borders a few years back sometimes he gets a bit carried away a lotta comics tend to though and his comedy comes across dopey yet easy to relate to clean no naughty words or uncouth situations here family fun comedy dirty or clean as long as a comedian can deliver to the audience well then he she is funny in my eyes
1,i bought this watch a couple months ago and it is superb it is a big watch but i am a big man and it looks quite hansom on my wrist but if your not a big guy i woudnt recommend this model now onto the timekeeping when i received the watch it ran a bit fast sec daily so instead of waiting the weeks to sent it to seiko for repair i took it to the local seiko dealership jeweler and had them regulate it for well worth the money and now it runs great this watch is an absolute tank i wear it every day it gets banged around quite a bit and there has yet to be even the slightest scratch in the hardlex crystal
0,the computer i have now about mhz is faster than my last one and the earlier version of plus worked well with my older model however my current model can t process most of the programs available so i just deleted the whole package i intend to get a faster computer in the near future and will use superpack at that time the features look pretty cool but i can t give it a favorable rating at this time however when i see how it would work with a faster processor i may re rate my review
0,i ve had a silicone case on my treo for a long time it was thin and the rubber was very grippy great anti slip once i left my treo on top of my car not recommended and drove miles and the case was so grippy that the phone was still on top when i arrived after it finally broke i ordered this one to replace it the rubber on the boxwave case is much thicker than my original case so much so that it s difficult to use the way navigator without it doing what i didn t want it to do the case is not nearly as grippy and slides off my car seat unlike the original boxwave offers full refunds if the product is defecive since this isn t i probably won t bother but in my opinion there s better products out there
1,after using my for about months now i have a few things to say about them price lists for on altec s site is a steal quality top notch in the earphones the clip on the volume module is weak performance bar none best i ve had these things outperform the huge logitech ear muff set i use mainly to mow in these things allow me to mow the lawn without having to jack up the volume to drown out the mower conclusion the only thing that stops me from saying these are perfect is the volume module can be a pain and get in the way when moving around you need to have it clipped to something otherwise it can create inner ear noise this can get quite annoying i ve also caught the cord on things causing the clip to bend away from the module it is removeable and i was able to bend it back if there were a pair of equal quality w o the module even for the same price i d go that route with that said i am in no way regretting my purchase and will recommend these to anyone asking me about them or my video ipod
1,i liked this game i mean final fantasy vii is still the god final fantasy game but this was ok i mean it also comes with chrono trigger if you have played chrono cross and got confused that means you never played trigger
1,the pros pda good mobile phone that really gets out a camera for all those kodak moments all packed in one for a good price the cons you ll need to get a replacement longer life battery seidio makes one and the browser blazer has many problems i m very happy with the purchase of this smartphone i ve wanted a treo for a few years but could never justify spending big bucks for one you can work around the problems with the unit with new battery and browser software it s a nice little phone i haven t bought a memory card for it so i can t report on the capabilities but i am going in that direction somehow i don t think it will replace my ipod but you never know

1,a friend who is a successful competition mountain bike rider asked me to weigh the blackburn airfix after i bought it he has had many occasions where his chain has broken or his tires have punctured so he wanted to compare the weight of the blackburn versus the weight of all the individual tools he carried when he rides the airfix weighed in at about grams about ounces and his tools including inflator tire levers hex wrenches and chain tool all included in the airfix tipped the scales at grams about ounces i suppose that a multitool may not be as convenient to use as individual tools but for handiness this seems hard to beat the blackburn lifetime no questions asked guarantee is also very attractive so while i have yet had to put this tool into action with either my trek or my trek in a world where every ounce of weight is a heavy concern pardon the pun i imagine i have made a wise purchase
1,my yr old son got this for his birthday he loved it and wears at always

1,pinback blows me away i consider my taste in music to be very diverse with a tendency to love obscure indie rock pop from the last three decades talk talk split enz to elliot smith and death cab pinback delivers some of the best most consistent music i ve heard in years i started with summer in abaddon and was weak in the knees then i acquired their debut album and could barely stand and now blue screen life has about knocked the breath right out of me i haven t gotten through the entire back catalog because i can t stop listening to the three albums i have in my hands words cannot express how fascinating this band is intricate complicated with a simple straightforward delivery their transitions are sick they put their contemporaries death cab the shins the killers to shame i love all of the aforementioned bands but pinback slaughters them in delivering well conceived perfectly executed diversified albums that you can listen to from front to back over over how many albums can you say that about they are heavenly the standouts are xiy boo concrete seconds bbtone prog pene oh screw it every song is great
1,well after all the media attention bully has arrived it would seem that all those nutty parental groups were wrong again may be now they ll focus on some real problems facing our poor children not only did this game prove not to be a columbine handbook it tries to show a better way to deal with the problems facing teens well the rant is over now for the rave the game mechanics are excellent like many of rockstar titles they ve improved on the gta engine allowing smoother play stepping away from the mission types in the gta series bully had to have better ideas without falling back on the gta typical t a wholesale killing now don t get me wrong i enjoy the gta series and most of rockstar s other releases i never passed shop class though seeing the gta open ended engine applied to another series just shows me the various directions they can go in as far as game creation the mini games are fun and addictive i wish they would have other classes represented with bully you get to not only play a great game but some of us old folks will travel back to a simpler time overall this is an excellent game worth your time and a is a fine example of how stupid the media and those parental groups can be

0,ageless body is deepak s attempt to neutralize the word old as in old age the writer has a knack for making common words like body mind and self into profound concepts his technique is to overlay his abstract ideas with suggestive experimental studies but ambiguity in interpreting these studies abound if you like poetry deepak may be your read the billions of changes occurring in our cells are only the passing scenery of life p or try to interpret this one the emptiness at the core of every atom is the womb of the universe in the flicker of thought when two neurons interact there is an opportunity for a new world to be born p at times he attributes to cells and dna a creative intelligence to direct their own construction and at other times his designer is invisible he would make a great spokesman for the current hocus pocus over intelligent design he can t accept the growth of any cell even a plant cell without an intelligence involved he mentions and attacks evolution only one time on p asserting that the growth of a cell could never be a random process deepak ends up in the very same thought circle as every other writer who tries to explain life in scientific terms intelligence is a self organizing entity and every cell evolved is only intelligence having a conversation with itself whether your word game tosses in the word quantum or not doesn t change much what a solipsistic thought what a solipsistic world i wonder if his readers who actually experienced the oneness deepak speaks of wouldn t after awhile go insane
0,somehow not up to her earlier work the instrumental accompaniment is good but tends to dominate at the expense of cesaria s voice and the songs don t strike me as particularly memorable one reviewer said this was perhaps the best thing she s done if so i just don t see it i was disiappointed and found myself wondering if maybe her best days are behind her i hope not
0,this one s going back to the store it has been turned on for almost half an hour and i barely feel the heat if you ask me my feet in some thick socks would produce the same amount of heat as for the massage it s worthless to me but i am not one for vibrating massage anyway i prefer shiatsu i get cold feet when i am home and not moving around a lot so i think i will stick to wrapping my electric throw blanket around my cold feet

1,when i first got a wireless network at home i purchased a kensington wifi finder it worked fine but as time went on i saw these smaller versions come out from chrysalis development i heard they were more powerful and more versatile so i bought one i was not disappointed since it was about the same size as my keyless entry remote for my car it fit perfectly on my keychain also it has a much longer range than the others but best of all it is directional meaning i can simply turn my body while holding down the button and the leds change instantly as the signal strength increases or decreases what a great product i love it

1,i bough this waterproof case for a trip to st thomas over christmas the photographs that we took came out perfect the flash diffuser worked well by eliminating the air bubbles that normally are captured with underwater cameras make sure that you set up your camera to the underwater mode so that it automaticlaly adjusts your color balance the only problem that i had was since it is so compact i often accidently would move the switch to movie mode this ruined a few photographs but also made a great movie of a sea turtle coming up for air i know that it was expensive but much cheaper than buying a new camera or buying multiple disposable underwater cameras and having x ray machines fog up the pictures
0,exactly months after i bought this stroller a bracket on the back that holds the bars together popped off making it dangerous and impossible to use luckily i bought the extended warranty and will receive a full refund in store warranty expired just days previously when i tested the stroller at the store i thought it seemed very flimsy and felt it wouldn t last long which is why i bought the warranty but the idea of having such a great stroller is why i decided to take the chance pros for the stroller very light compact and easy to fold easy to maneuver great for tall people like me don t have to hunch over to reach the handles there are some nice little things too like ventilation for the back a headrest a cup holder and a reclining position cons are only rated for carrying children under lbs in each seat didn t know this when i purchased it i have a lb y o and a newborn so we don t exceed the limit there but my lb y o can t use it the canopy doesn t cover kids well from the shade only the face and that s a big deal when living in southern az or if it s raining and when the seat is reclined for my newborn the canopy doesn t even cover her head i have to clip on a blanket and drape it over my y o practically is too big for it her head extends above the top of the seat and finally the general construction of the stroller is not sturdy overall this could be a great stroller but it s just not sturdy obviously not it broke but one would expect that with a brand name jeep it would be built better we only use it for walks and going out no off trail stuff we used it about times before it broke my umbrella stroller i bought years ago is still going strong why can t they make this just as well built i would love this stroller if it were just built better

0,i have used turbo tax for at least past eight years and always have been very pleased with it this year however some genius decided to change the entire format and approach and i found this year s version to be terrible very confusing now when used to be clear and simple hard to even download confusing up dates difficult to find numerous frequently used items estimated taxes paid in previous year capital gains losses state taxes paid and more the running total of taxes owed in upper left hand corner came out different from final taxes supposedly owed i have zero confidence in this year s program doing my taxes correctly so will have to have an accountant do return for first time in many years have recommended turbo tax to many over the years but would strongly recommend against buying this year s product a perfect example of how to take something good and make it lousy by messing with it suggest you save your money and either go to an accountant or use another firms software this one stinks

1,from the commercials max payne was a third person shooter with a twist the twist being able to kill mobsters junkies and mercenaries in slow motion truly one gets hooked on being able to leap backward in slow motion whilst rapidly firing dual handguns to put the kibosh on those that are trying to do the same to you aside from the slow mo max payne is essentially a third person shooter whereupon you take control of the title undercover cop turned anti hero max payne the story unfolds dramatically as you delve into the game the jist of it is max s wife and baby were brutally murdered by junkies and he s on the hunt for revenge the plot widens thickens and nearly bursts as you progress through the game one can never tell who truly is on max s side until the moment the credits roll at the end the bottom line is this game is very much based on the slow motion bullet time gunfights would be nearly impossible without the ability to slow them down to aim and fire with apt precision that brings about the issue with controls one of the cons of the game are the controls many times have i fallen off balconies and ledges due to the analog stick making max move just so to the right the heavy load times can also add to the agony especially when after over a dozen tries one still cannot overcome the obstacles in your way the game is definitely run on a sliding scale the chapters start out a cake walk and progress to a veritable teeth grinder at one point i was so fed up and enraged by the game that i had to go outside and take a walk if however you can take the time out to relax focus and be patient you should have little problem with the game as for guns there are lots of them and more ammo than you can handle oftentimes you ll find a gun you really like and stick with it in the process having to leave ammo behind on the corpses of your enemies that being said guns don t hold as much ammo as one would want especially given the fact there is a huge surplus of ammunition abounds max also chews up painkillers like chocolate chips in order to heal himself proof that he s not a guy to be messed with i personally was very much hooked on it the cutscenes are treated in a comic book style with dialogue and inner soliloquies lifted from a dashiell hammett novel however simply put one will either love or detest this game i was reeled in by it but am very glad i ve beaten and seen the end of it however if you just cannot get enough max payne there are two additional difficulty settings unlocked after beating it along with a third even harder setting unlocked after those the game was in parts extremely easy and in other parts extremely challenging i wouldn t recommend picking this game up unless you re ready for oftentimes graphic violence innuendo and potty mouthery i also wouldn t recommend picking up this game if you re not ready to be put on the verge of ripping your hair out in frustration it is however conquerable and you ll very much be pleased once you do overcome the challenges
0,i bought this item a few weeks before hurricane wilma hit south florida i kept it charged for weeks without using it at all after the storm hit and i tried to use it that night the spotlight stayed on for only mins tops before it totally ran out of power luckily the car charger was in the box and the lantern light worked very well on a full charge but i do not give praise to this item at all and i gave it the credit it deserved the star is for the lantern and not the spotlight crappy at best please do not bu
1,i was really pleased with the quality of this patio table it was shipped immediately and we received it in less than days after ordering as others have commented the instructions and screws furnished with the table were not for the table i ordered i had to buy additional screws at home depot four in total the missing instructions for the table ordered were not really needed it was simple enough to put together without instructions all tools needed were included with the shipment had i not needed to purchase additional screws i would have given this product stars
0,my primary camera is a sony hdr i bought the gl as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events the gl is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image doesn t even come close to the sony the price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera however beware of the rebate offer i sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected the rebate facilitator claimed i did not include the upc code if i had it to do over i would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second sony
0,i was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be i mean at almost invested included shipping i was expecting better quality well it s very thin made in china and has plastic snaps the so called polyester lining just adds to the heat that s generated i ve owned many ponchos through the years and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period the reason involves the way it s cut what i ve learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn t lift it up or out and allow the elements inside next you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time so a good lining or a breathable system is required if you re just going to use it for short bursts in the rain then you can get a cheap nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere however if you camp a lot or will be out in the elements you need better the best poncho i ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner this solves both of the problems i mentioned because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat
1,when i had seen this camera on net i had anticipated to be quite big but this one is really small handy except for the lcd panel which is cumbersome to open always its a great camera the zoom is amazing and so is the image stabilization to go with it
1,i like this for more than one reason so read on reason it keeps on charging your cell phone when you are transferring data trust me this helps when you are transferring gb of data you will loose reasonable amount of battery charge on your cell phone reason only data that can be played by your cell phone gets transferred so this way you will know before hand that all the data you transferred will actually play when you are in the back seat of your car you will have to use windows media player to sync this phone samsung sync sgh in order to transfer files and wmv wma formats work with this phone i do not know whether other formats work or not let me explain in brief how to sync this phone with windows media player connect one end of the cable to your phone first and the usb end to your computer usb port preferably usb if you have already inserted media card into the phone you will see two drives named samsung phone and samsung media card when you open my computer on your computer now open windows media player you will be able to see the following tabs just below main menu from left to right you will be able to see in this order now playing library rip burn sync and guide click on sync make sure your cell phone is connected now you will see two halves in the same window left half is for you to drag and drop your file that needs to be transferred and right half is where it goes your cell phone name apears on the top usually windows media player prepares to transfer the file this takes a while also just above the right window in the drop down box make sure you select samsung media card as the samsung phone option has very limited memory once you are well versed with what your phone can play i would recommed copying files to your microsd using a usb reader writer as windows media player takes time preparing the windows environment for sucessful transfer this saves you a chunk of time and battery power
0,i purchased this camera from amazon recently the first time around the camera tape door wouldn t shut the very first time i opened it i returned the camera and amazon was great about replcing it promptly the second time around the dv port worked once and only once there s a short in it there is a reason this camera is so cheap it s j u n k i will add that a friend of mine is on her second jvc as well a fact i did not know until all of this came about for two stars i ll say the video quality is good the camera battery does hold a full min charge i had no sound issues what so ever background noise none here as for still pictures if you don t know what you re doing as far as shutter speeds back light etc forget it the still pictures are very grainy if you want professional looking stills do not buy a camcorder for this purpose jvc tech support is useless camcorder comes with a usb wire to upload still only as on any digital camcorders you cannot upload video in real time on a usb port you need a firewire this does not come with one also you need to check if you have a firewire port on your computer i paid app dollars here on amazon including shipping for a port and firewire it took only a few minutes to insert the port into my tower it s no big deal amazon has just informed me via email that they will not replace my camera a third time only refund my money this camera is now listed as cheaper than when i bought it last month overall amazon was great about service and return however this particular jvc item is junk
1,this seat along with the matching step stool are great my daughter loves having her very own special toilet seat and step for going potty it has encouraged her to potty train it fits the toilet seat nicely and is easy for her to put on the toilet by herself i put a suction hanger on the toilet tank and is easily put out of the way when mommy and daddy need to go potty and she can easily get it and set it up for herself as well

1,sahale snacks were a pleasant surprise they re not over sweet nor over hot and they ve got a lot of flavor and texture over all i d say they re among the best snacks you can buy not only in terms of taste and freshness but because they re far healthier than a lot of the stuff you find on the grocery shelves however the price is pretty high for the amount you get even at the substantially reduced price of the variety pack it s a little high however for the occasional treat it s well worth the price it s just not the sort of snack you can dump into a bowl and pass around while watching movies
1,this guy is going to become big someday i agree with this reviewer the songs on seven swans with a folksy bucholic feeling that runs through most of them tell of spiritual tales they tell of love that transcends the body and age sufjan can appeal equally to the christian person as to the one who practices zen buddhism and that is something few songwriters can accomplish keep an eye on sufjan for years to come i have fun tooling around with to be alone with you on the guitar such a simple but infectious melody seven swans is not over orchestrated like michigan and illinois seem to be good song to ok song ratio is about percent on this one and about percent on the the aforementioned cd s seven swans is a great way to get introduced to the subtle musical power and overall genius of sufjan sufjan has all his own style and is not afraid to tell us who he is very creative he truly forges his own musical path cannot wait for his cd called wisconsin
0,i bought this for my child who uses it at school and loves it i have a mac pro running the latest version of mac os i installed it and it needs to run on resolution which is kind of silly in this day and age but that works ok what does not work is that it crashes about every minutes pretty unworkable don t bother buying this for a mac
0,turbo tax is less than impressive in handling stock and option transactions it seems to view short sales as errors reporting that the date acquired is later than the date sold it does not appear to have a provision for tagging a short sale it does not appear to have a provision for properly dealing with dividends on stock held for more than months but covered by disqualifying call options its screens for schedule d and are awkward it would be much better to have one large table screen for all transactions with tags to set short term and long term tax application from which d and could be formatted for filing
1,the only refined sugar in this brownie mix is in the chocolate chips otherwise it s naturally sweetened and it s easier to put together than are the mundane supermarket brands add one egg butter or oil or applesauce if you re an oil free person and a little water throw it in a degree oven for minutes that s it i m an active home cook and a rather intense one we make our own vanilla roast our own coffee beans so it s no surprise that i d say the results aren t as good as homemade but they are very good and i could put the mix together between innings while watching a baseball game how s that for easy i ll be making this mix again
1,explodes upon the crime detective scene the hundreth man his first book was excellent and the death collectors is as good and even better can t wait for the next one why this is an amazon sale item befuddles me but since it is grab this bargain while you can because it is a terrific novel the psit team of lapd carson ryder and harry nautilus are faced with a dual time mystery more than years in the past a serial killer with a following of mesmerized women who adore him is killed in the courtroom the day he is sentenced and now starting with the grizzly find of a murdered prostitute in a seedy motel room it seems as though the serial killer has risen from the dead to continue his reign of terror each time a new murder surfaces the killer is a step ahead and just out of reach of carson and harry the touch of subtle humor adds bas relief without taking anything away from the thread of the story and lightens it tension for brief seconds at a time perfect the murders are freakish disgusting brutal but the two psit detectives refuse to give up and what finally unravels the twisted cloth of this old new mystery will knock you out of your chair a truly masterfully plotted novel with two familiar and charismatic partners against crime a series to follow and enjoy get both of kerley s books and double your pleasure try them you ll like them and you ll love jack kerley i promise
1,i am a former general nutrition center employee and there are hundreds of powdered protein products that hype about the most important ingredient known for any person that works out if you want a simple great tasting protein supplement that will help satisfy your daily intake without feeling sick bloated or passing gas then you need to trust in optimum nutritions whey protein it truly gives you the results you need as far as quality and nutrition goes i strongly recommend milk over water for even better taste but water will still do the trick if you buy vanilla i suggest mixing it with berries bananas strawberries or bananas for added taste this is by far the best protein supplement out there that is worth more for your money
0,no longer intended to be a comprehensive reference the guinness book is now a sort of compilation of interesting superlatives with oversized pictures and many features that aren t even actual records most overrated celebrity if you re going to do this why not offer one edition that plays it by the book so dies a noble institution
0,the only good thing about this kit is that your child can get some joy out of painting a few volcanoes on a cheap plastic sheet but the real promise of this kit to see a model volcano erupt may not be fulfilled we followed all the steps and got tripped by a poorly designed base above mentioned cheap plastic sheet that is extremely difficult to balance on ill fitting stilts a poor experience for the kids the eruption was more of a fizzle waste of money and time
1,i used this feeder last season and now i am getting a second one to hang nearby it s the best feeder i ve ever used and i think i ve tried them all for this reason it is a cinch to clean the metal flowers are part of the metal base which screws off easily you just wash and go there are no weird angles to try and get a brush into or thick plastic flowers that attract black gunk and won t let it go and the hummers love it if you have to choose one feeder this season this is the one i recommend

0,i bought this album after hearing america their single off this album and listening to the increasing hype about razorlight and johnny borrell being one of the most talented singer songwriters of his generation this follow up is a thorough disappointment compared to their first it s not bad but it s not that good either the songs all sound like i ve heard them somewhere before and the lyrics well how many times have we heard popstars going on about waiting by the phone nothing on the radio and not known what it all meant while smoking cigarettes late at night yawn
1,i agree that this is hands down the best water bottle on the market take a regular water bottle and add a flip up bite valve that prevents leaks just like on camelbak hydration backpacks the bottle also includes a removeable straw so you can drink without having to turn the bottle upside down my only criticism is that the bottle is hard plastic and may break more easily than the soft plastic water bottles that you can buy elswhere however the lid is a standard size and will fit on most other water bottles thus by combining the lid from this bottle with other water bottles you can get the best of both worlds also it would be nice if the bottle had an insulation option so as to prevent condensation from forming on the outside of the bottle
0,i was a bit disappointed in this tape the workouts are too easy i had mastered abs of steel i and was looking for abs of steel i couldn t find it so i bought this one but its too easy i found a used abs of steel and i like it much better

0,i have owned the dmr for over months it is a combo dvd vcr unit i have had sufficient time to become intimately familiar with the pros and cons of the unit the manual it is imperative to have the manual this machine is somewhat complicated and frequent trips to the instructions is necessary if everything is working correctly you can usually find the instructions that you need somewhere in it it is overly time consuming though since the items don t seem to logically flow if you dig long and hard enough though they are in there somewhere the set up being somewhat experienced at setting up a home theater this was generally easy the text and pictures were sufficient searching through the function menu i learned that to perform the same action and different levels required using different imput buttons this is needlessly confusing of course the auto clock set function isn t very accurate i haven t seen an accurate one yet dvd playback the general playback is pretty straight forward i really miss some of the extra playback features that are on my jvc progressive player which is years older finding a scene in a movie is comparatively difficult a zoom feature is missing many convenience features are not present dvd recording recording onto a dvd ram disc is a dream compared to old fashioned vcr tapes i really enjoy using them a quirk you must have the unit in stand by to record from the scheduler this mandates that to watch a recorded show while recording another on the same disc you must wait until the unit begins recording then select the show to watch from the navigator the uhf tuner has some trouble recording somewhat weak signals from channel other weak channels record but not this problem started about months after initial set up there is an annoying bug with daylight savings time and the newer extended time period the panasonic web site suggests going into the set up menu and unchecking the dst box thus removing the feature if this did anything it would allow you to set the clock manually being without the automatic dst adjustment would not be annoying but even though you turn off this feature it still resets your clock twice a day at noon and at est this ruins any tv scheduling you had set this malady persisted until the date of the former dst spring ahead arrived several weeks of scheduling hell i requested assistance from customer service but never received the telephone call that was promised no message no number to call just a promise to call again when i was home the vcr use this feature is really buggy you are supposed to be able to eject a cassette with the remote but this only worked for a month or two when a tv show is scheduled for recording the unit won t tape it if you merely insert a cassette it doesn t recognize the insertion of the cassette unless the tape has been made to move either playing a little or fast forwarding reversing this is really annoying last impression the last movie last king of scotland i watched took over the machine the remote control would not function the disc would not stop and the disc could not be ejected it was necessary to unplug the unit restart it eject the disc and totally reset all menu items which were randomly reset to various settings worse some settings are no longer selectable one other movie would not even play in the machine forcing me to use the trusty jvc unit i must say that this machine has many of the same problems that are still occurring in the new units from what i read at this forum and other ones these units are being released for sale way before they are ready for public consumption i recommend looking elsewhere
1,i ve had this card for about years now and it has performed flawlessly it has seen thousands of photos no exaggeration on my digital camera and now holds data for my palm too did you know you can pop your sd card out of a camera and into a palm to view photos i just learned this anyway it s a nice product and i m about to get another simpletech with megs or higher if they have one if you are new to sd memory always get more storage than you need because eventually you ll buy something that will use one camera handhelds cell phones etc note that many cell phones use a smaller minisd
1,monkey business is one of the cutest movies i have ever seen and it s just so funny to see cary grant and ginger rogers take the youth serum and act like children and they were great and also the monkey were absolutely adorable this movie is recommended highly
0,this program sucks i used it last year and thought that it was unwieldy and really confusing i e unlike turbotax and other programs there s very little transparency in the system then i bought it again this year because the store that i went to was out of turbotax and i needed to get my taxes done quickly this year was even worse than last year not only was it still unwieldy and irritating but it gave me figures that simply did not make sense the results for the federal return were ok but it gave me figures that would have cost me over in taxes that i did not owe on my state return i ended up going online to double check my results using a cheap online service recommended by the ny state tax website within minutes i cleared the online source and got results that made far more sense i have no idea what happened with taxcut but i suspect that they may have been missing a field somewhere along the line this is a problem that has been noted by a number of others in reviews on a variety of sites i will not be buying this product again
0,i bought this card for my supposedly a supported device but the problems with this card make it nearly useless it comes with a web browser that doesn t work even if the browser did work it would only work for days before you had to buy the full version the only downloadable browser that works with the card is eudora which doesn t do anything except display text you can t even fill in web forms with it so webmail searches etc are impossible the card is designed to work with netfront and clie mail software that comes with internet enabled clie devices obviously not what you would have if you were buying the card these programs are not available separately the card wouldn t connect to either my wireless network or the neighbors even though my powerbook has no trouble connecting to either no additional configuration required while attempting to connect the card would often stop responding and then lock up the handheld bottom line if you want a web enabled pda buy a web enabled pda don t buy this
1,this is a great and unique product to encourage creativity as well as physical fitness
1,i ordered this shade hoping that it would cover all of my baby when we re out strolling in the sun it does a pretty good job only my son s feet and ankles are exposed when he is reclined my only beef about the product but i can cover his little piggies and ankles with sunscreen or shoes with no problem i like the fact that the shade protects from uv rays and is easily adjustable i leave it on my stroller all the time and can still fold up the stroller with it attached i think the side pouches are an excellent plus i am very pleased with this product and will recommend it to my friends and family

1,original concept it generates imagination through the different colors and designs the child can create and is a reliable watch too all that for an afordable price
0,it lasted a year and it goes in the dishwasher and that is all the good there is to say about it now the bad the pivot point where the back attaches to the chair is poorly engineered and comes off way to easy mine is warn to the point that my month old can pull it off when he is sitting in it first he takes the tray off also very easy for him and then he pulls the back off at that point he shimmies out of the straps and is out of the whole thing don t plan on it lasting through more than one child
1,i got this camera for my birthday present in january and i m extremely satisfied i m very new to the entire photography world however this camera makes it easy to get into the camera is smaller than i expected however it takes great pictures i use it often for pictures while we are on trips the picture quality is great however screen quality isn t up to par with other brands this is a great value and i really like it my only complaint is that the easyshare software is bad it s slow outdated and doesn t work well overall i recommend getting a gb sd card i have of them

0,i ve given it stars instead of because after i used this cd the sound from my system did seem to be a little better the cd s were not skipping as much but the bottom line is it didn t fix the problem as the cds are still skipping noticeably although not as bad as before not sure if this has anything to do with the fact that my set has a disk cd changer
1,i have shooting pains in my upper left arm said the pilot to brian brian is the main character in the book hatchet this book would be for someone who likes survival in the wilderness or even just survival i like this book because i am into this type of writing i think gary paulson is a very intelegant man because who could have thought of a book about a boy who his plain crashes into the canadian wilderness and do you think he survived the wilderness he does survive the wilderness submitted by peanut
0,i know that everyone else seems to love this so perhaps my complaint is more about apple in general my ipod mini pink is a lemon the battery has never worked properly it takes longer to charge than to discharge and my current playing time per charge no changing settings not backlighting nothing but hitting play and waiting till the battery dies is about hours apple will gladly sell me a new battery but other than that tough it is apparently my fault thet they re selling shoddy products i m not saying don t buy it there aren t realistically any better choices out there than the ipod but buy it when you have a week to sit around and evaluate it and when they get around to opening a store near you as for me i think i m going to dig out my old discman
0,this book was so different from the usual nr story the burn scenes were too graphic and the rape scene was too graphic if you want romance skip this it also seemed to take forever to get the book set up

0,do not do not do not do not buy any products from the weslo company i just received my weslo cadence treadmill and have attempted to assemble it the handrail holes are not drilled in the proper spots so that they may be attached correctly to the console the customer service numbers are all disconnected their website gives an additional number to call and a recorded message tells you to either call the now disconnected numbers or puts you on hold for about minutes before it hangs up on you i have wasted an entire afternoon trying to contact them this company is a complete scam if you are even considering buying one of their products your money is better spent getting your head checked
1,i first got a whiff of this from a magazine enclosure it got me curious as they rarely do passing sephora i went in for a test and felt seduced by the classy charm of the scent it seemed to have a rich sophistication which goes with horseback riding or polo after a few days i still couldn t get the scent out of my head so i went back to grab it up i ve only had this experience with a few other fragrences but they were of a totally different style angel by thierry mugler and flower by kenzo
1,i bought the card mnths ago at first didnt notice it but the usable memory kept getting smaller finally it gave a error reading card message and stopped working customer service at viking was very very helpful and prompt they replaced the card is days they also tried to retrieve some of the images that i had considered lost in the card and sent me a cd with the images on it i was impressed with the excellent support but not too impressed that the card died so early in its life would i buy it again yes but likely go for keeping a backup card on hand at all times as well
1,i bought this based on the amazon reviews i am extremely new at this but the software is pretty good the teacher is somewhat annoying and as another reviewer said he sings over his playing way too much i wish there was a way to turn him way down and the guitar up it touts having over lessons but that is somewhat misleading i don t doubt it has over pages but i covered lessons in about an hour i do like the fact that the first few lessons he teaches you very easy versions of the chords so you don t feel hung up on doing the full chords when your fingers don t want to move to strange new positions they aren t used to i am using this as well as fender s dvd for acoustic with keith wyatt the dvd is a little more challenging for me but keith wyatt is much better than the guy from the emedia software and he doesn t feel the need to sing overall i would recommend this software
0,the nose trimmer works well but the electric razor not well at all does not cut at all i would suggest the nose trimmer but not the razor the cost was a little high for the product
0,i ve had the for about six months and have been pleasantly surprised by the ease of use and reasonable picture quality for a camera after six months the lens and cover have jammed and i noticed that many amazon reviewers have had the same issue one evening i took several pictures and the next morning the camera would not operate i m hoping the service center can provide me better service than some of the reviewers
1,i purchased this for christmas for my year old son to play with it was with free shipping compared to at the local sports store the finished product looks great appears to be rugged and stable and is quite easy to adjust i only gave it stars because assembly was not easy and i am mechanically inclined practically all the holes needed to be drilled or reamed out in order to accept the bolts and the directions were ambiguous it was a hour assembly with filling the base with screened sand really taxing my patience but the smile on the year old s face was well worth the aggravation on a side note i ordered of my christmas shopping from amazon with everything except this arriving before the estimated delivery date everything else shipped ups they shipped this via dhl which never delivered the package i had to drive mile round trip to pick it up at the dhl facility and take time off of work the friday before christmas to retrieve my son s primary gift i emailed amazon requesting credit to reimburse me for my time and gas which they did in a few days this was an oversized package that i assume ups would not accept nonetheless their choice of shippers reflects on amazon as a company

1,we got this monitor because of other reviews we read about it we have a graco for our daughter and it picks up so much static and other back round noice you can hardly hear her on it the baby quiet sounds works great as far as being able to hear the baby clearly the receiver eats up the batteries fast and has some fed back with only batterie use our graco does that too so i don t know if that is the norm with monitors the sound is the best when pluged in the nightlight is great the humidity function i have not figured out as of yet it say s it is in every room and i don t know that is correct the temp works fine i have not played enough with it yet to set the controls and how it works i like that the time is on the receiver and that it lights up to see it at night time i haven t used the timer yet but could see how it could be helpful over all like my choice in the monitor

0,i originally had to read this book for a history of rock and roll class at the university of cincinatti i found the subject interesting and the professor gave wonderful lectures i had good expectations about this book going in but those quickly soured as i read it it seems correct at least about the social problems of the different eras and their relation to rock not that such is a particularly daunting feet however it is rife with laughable fallacies for instance it calls david bowie amongst other glam rock bands of the era metal it futher goes on to call many pop bands of the and rock when they have no guitar work and no bass line at all such as the carpenters i really had a good laugh when they called bad religion hardcore bad religion is about as hardcore as elvis is rap further massive genre confusion consisted throughout the entire book i also noted several drastic misinterpretations of songs for instance it claims thunder rolls by garth brooks is about domestic violence its about infedility not focusing on violence at all but rather the emotional ramificationsof being cheated on the writing is also rather dry many times it is merely a citing of the names of band members as well as constantly describing minor changes in bands lineups which are of no true consequence it also tends to list off songs which have no impact on any giving band s successes or failures after reading the book in completetion i really had to question the earlier passages about older rock and blues to that i had thought were true in the end i felt that it wasted my time and money and possibly misinformed me more than anything
1,i love paper i always buy it along with the village voice to find out what to do where to go in the city i find it perfect for daytripping it s got fun fashion too i m a professional artist book lover and former new yorker
1,while nothing in the film works very well except perhaps the chemistry between travolta and stowe the sublime soundtrack is another story descriptions such as haunting and soul moving are right on the money one might also add ineffable to the list

0,i bought this camera for its great price good reviews and overall reputation as a great camcorder for the novice shooter i returned the camera after three weeks however due to abysmal low light performance among other things the catalyst for purchasing this camera was the impending birth of our first child i took the camera to the hospital and filmed some of the labor delivery and follow up unfortunately when we returned home to view our footage much of it was grainy and plagued with shadows and silhouettes the camera does include a light and a magicpix option but unless you re using a tripod you re bound to end up with a strobe light effect perfect for recreating thriller music videos but not much help otherwise i also found the image quality with the to be fairly lackluster and pixilated granted you get what you pay for but i was really taken aback that my camcorder shot much better footage that being said the camera did a lot better in good outdoor lighting albeit still somewhat pixilated and the zoom is incredible the camera is very light and smaller than i anticipated in the end i returned the camera in favor of a more significant investment i will say that amazon did a great job with customer service throughout also if you do buy this camera make sure to buy the dv cable firewire for macs through amazon or some other online retailer
0,edited review my first order came with leaking jars amazon replaced and the second order arrived in good condition the one star which i can t seem to change reflected that fact my updated review is three stars i was mildy disappointed in this topping out of the jar the black olives and the artichokes provide a flavor that has definate sour notes the texture of the ingrediants was pasty as opposed to chunky i would have given this only two stars if this was supposed to be a pasta sauce however i followed the directions on the jar to create their version of bruschetta it is acceptable since this is billed as a topping i am willing to give it three stars since in that capacity to performs at a pleasurable level the vodka sauce is much more to my liking

0,ga how can anyone stand this drivel worst movie i ever watched repeatedly worse than watching walk tall times in a row worse even than watching the home shopping network eww eww
0,the leather case has a magnetc latch the magnetic force is strong enough for an sd card to stick onto it i have not lost any images yet and the camera has not gone haywire but i decided not to chance it i am surprised that canon cautions against placing the camera in strong magnetic fields in their user guide yet produce an accesory with this feature although constructed of fine leather the case is also very bulky making the tiny slim elph twice as thick and too big to fit into a pocket or purse the neck strap is ok it looks metallic but is wrapped inside a clear plastic tubing making it look quite cheap and stiff again increasing the bulk of the camera the battery works fine but the two other accessories are not worth the extra money
1,i order this magazine for my wife she is a good cook but is enchanted with the magazin
0,this basket is not stainless steel as advertised it is merely chrome plated i returned it immediately and have been dinged for return shipping costs and other miscellaneous fees as the error was not our fault amazon is continuing to advertise this item as something it is not despite being alerted to the discrepancy by other consumers i believe that qualifies this error as being entirely their fault this is not the level of customer service i have come to expect and rely upon in my dealings with amazon

1,this is a good affordable uv filter for protecting your expensive lenses i leave it on my lens all the time this particular filter l sharp cut is especially good for wide angle lenses focal length because of its ultrathin profile which prevents vignetting i have used regular filters on wide angle lenses with very bad results although this filter is not multi coated i have not found it to be a big deal in the pictures i ve taken multi coated uv filters can cost or the price of this one which i don t think is worthwhile all in all i recommend this filter for canon or non canon lenses
0,waveceptor doesnt work properly it doesnt get in sync with new daylight savings and you dont even have a knob to manually correct it the watch i bought is just of no use to me now i would have to return it to casio for repair
0,face is made of cheap plastic it scratched within an hour of putting it on watch had about scratches and dimples after weeks i ve been wearing a cheap casio for the last two years that hardly has a scratch on it other problems include the buttons press very easily making the watch change functions constantly for example when i put my hand in my pocket or put on a coat also the functionality of the watch is not very intuitive with five buttons it should be much easier to move through the different functions of the watch finally the watch is very well photographed in the ad and doesn t look any nicer than my cheap casio in reality

0,i have this program on a day demo it might be ok if i didn t mind my computer becoming almost unusable i tried to run the system virus scan as recommended but after hours it was only done because it was stuck on a file it couldn t seem to get past i skipped the file but then it quickly got stuck again the time remaining said it would take days to complete so i cancelled that scan it has a learning mode that initally blocks everything apparently this program has no brain for example i have the live search toolbar installed in outlook it had to ask me if it was ok to run that dll file in fact each program that called up a process from a shared dll has to ask permission before it could run don t even get me started on the quickbooks and internet explorer problems which is what it wouldn t let those programs do even after they had been run and i repeated clicked allow over and over twice today it got so slow running ie that it finally crashed the computer so bad that i had to do a hard re boot if you have it checking ports on your computer almost nothing would run or download on ie so i m going to demo a few more but it s probably back to windows live onecare which i had the past year it just doesn t seem to do much no long list of features but it also doesn t jam everthing else up
1,i rarely write reviews of music but feel that i must share my impressions of this cd i have long heard some of my favorite singers praise the songwriting prowess of townes but somehow never got around to buying one of his records i finally picked this one up because it had two songs that were covered by two of my favorite singers lyle lovett lungs among others and steve earle tecumseh valley i was blown away by the sheer beauty and poetry of every song on this recording other reviewers seem to be comparing this to other townes records i come from a different angle as someone who has long heard townes sopken of with the highest praise i can say this disk does not disappoint and will influence me to fill out my collection of his recordings i will also say that i am deeply frustrated that i never took advantage of the chance to see townes perform while he was alive
1,my just turned year old can figure out of the logic needed in this game he can t do a very few of the tasks like fly the dragon to win that hero time and there was one stone monster boss guy i had to finally defeat for him but he really likes this game he gets the goals and can figure out with some hunting and trial and error how to get thru the chapters it has a tad more killing of stuff than i care for but what doesn t these days he likes being able to be different characters his favorite is puss n boots as a grown up i enjoyed it as well especially the humor
0,the legend goes that there was a time a few decades ago when the gramophone was the unquestioned authority for reviews of recordings of classical music whether or not that legend is true i m too young to know gramophone s time has definitely passed today there is a multitude of sources of free information on classical music on the internet from newsgroups to websites some of it is less well informed than gramophone s criticism but some of it is more well informed what is undeniable is that for the price of a few mouse clicks it is possible to find a far greater range of reviews of recordings on the internet than gramophone with its british based critics can offer what is more gramophone is tied to a business model for the classical music industry that is fast becoming obsolete historically the most important classical recordings were issued by a few so called major companies such as emi deutsche grammophon and cbs later sony these majors would buy lavish advertising spreads in gramophone and so finance the magazine in return gramophone would devote lengthy reviews to the majors new releases and would produce pages of fluffy interviews with musicians under contract to the majors today the situation is different the most interesting new release is more likely to appear as a on an obscure russian website than on a new cd from sony small companies dedicated solely to classical music recordings produce great results on shoestring budgets while the major corporations have virtually abandoned new classical recordings this development causes problems for gramophone s business model the new players in the classical music industry don t have the publicity budgets to fund a glossy magazine like gramophone through advertising with gramophone s implicit bargain advertise with us or we won t review your recordings the magazine seems to be becoming more and more irrelevant if you want to subscribe to a classical music periodical i recommend international record review or fanfare both offer substantially more reviews per month than gramophone but most of all i suggest checking out the huge range of classical music information available for free on the web and usenet
1,i bought this to go with my shaver i saw a review that said that it kept the shaver running well i ve been using it for about month and i couldn t agree more a quick spray on the cutters after shaving and the next time i use it it runs like new i can tell the difference in the smoothness and speed of the shaver since i ve started using it as a bonus it seems to last quite a while another strong product from remington
1,what happened to the clue chronicles first off you may notice a couple of things this is called clue chronicles it is refered to as episode sometimes it is a game with no sequel why is this well clue chronicles was from hasbro interactive and eai eai quit the gaming business and hasbro quit computer games and was left with board games so the promising series was doomed if you enjoy this game i advise you to write into atari why atari well hasbro was left with all their computer games they passed all the rights to infogrames which became atari so in the complicated and confusing clue chronicles timeline the rights are held with atari i will and if you like the game you should too write to atari and ask for a sequel now for the real review my review clue chronicles follows the story of unlucky party guests on a mysterious yacht owned by ian masque after he drops dead the mystery begins did a box kill him so it seems join the old cast miss scarlet mr green mrs peacock colonel mustard professer plum and mrs white along with a new cast of characters including marina popov julia kell sabata martin urfe and for a short time ian masque you are a detective nobody has ever met this man is person what did he want with them and you there is an answer but you need to play the game to find it out with an airtight plot that doesn t stop even after the story ends you will be gasping for breathe at the heartstopping cliffhanger ending my grades story well thought out with an unexpected ending gameplay minor glitches that don t effect the gameplay but involve disappearing characters in the background soundtrack music mostly fits the scenes vo the voiceovers are great except for one small part towards the end graphics its an old game that about sums it up no final a will always be a favorite
1,having to get a mindset and change eating habits due to health issues has proved to be a challenge but with so many snacks that can be had that are actually good for you and that taste good it has been pretty easy this item for one we love what they are not airy super sweet empty calories what they are please read the nutritonal chart so i don t have to type it all out the sodium level is a good choice for those that have to limit salt intake calories are not outrageous they have a slight taste of caramel that comes from the rice syrup peanut butter they were not overly gooey they are a bit more weighty than the others but it s because there is some substance here we have learned to eat and enjoy our food at a slower pace so one will suffice vs of the others we use to scarf down in one sitting i give stars as product was in date tasted fresh has a good taste nutrition worthy packaged conveniently

1,fundamentally the reason we use a pen is to write on paper right and the component of the pen that affects how a ball point pen writes is the refill so when i bought a waterman pen for the design i was happily surprised that the refill was great the ink flows smoothly it doesn t blob it has a high capacity and is offered at a decent price waterman is an old time pen maker and they have a great reputation these refills complete the package

0,the movie is one of my favorites works on both a romantic level and a comic level but where s the widescreen todays consumers are more educated thank god and they ve almost stopped asking the stupid question why watch widescreen you lose the top and bottom of the movie they finally get that you are seeing more of the movie with widescreen and not less so how can i be expected to buy this dvd it is for all intents and purposes incomplete who s going to pay for all of something and be satisfied with only getting some of it buy this movie as soon as ws version becomes availible

0,dirty deeds is one of those movies that you sit through saying to yourself this is idiotic but instead of abandoning it midway through you find yourself still sitting through it until the credits begin to roll it s silly it s a teenager movie it s been done a million times before in hollywood most of the time poorly dirty deeds is one of the sub par high schoolers making mischief attempts where if you re perusing cable late one night and can t find anything else on your channels is maybe worth a stop if you re determined to watch tv instead of just going to bed but who knows you might be seeing the beginning of some great careers just look what s teeneager movie hollywood knights launched for the likes of michelle pfeiffer tony danza robert wuhl and fran drescher everybody s got to start somewhere right

1,either you get on the train or you don t and as long as you continue to get on the train you ll grasp the meaning of christmas the true meaning of christmas but you have to be willing to get on this movie was a great adaptation of the classic story i must admit i was a tad bit wigged out by the animation it was just oogey in some ways realistic at times and at other times so unbelievably fake i couldn t decide if i liked the animation or not still can t but the story itself is worth the struggle i had with the animation get on board you ll be glad you did
0,i was so excited to see this game come out i loved the godfather and from russia with love and the hype surrounding this game was incredible the actual game however was incredibly disappointing the driving controls especially compared to the driving controls in the godfather are awful i was having so much trouble driving i kept looking through the handbook to see if i was doing something wrong but from what i saw i was using the controller the way i was supposed to most of the missions involve driving under a specific time limit and with these awful controls i gave up early way too frustrating the musical play list that you get to control was fun but i would have liked more free roaming like in the godfather i was also looking forward to hearing everyone s voices that were in the opening credits dale earnhardt jr but since i have almost totally given up on it now i guess i won t get to hear their voice acting talent does anyone know if they plan to re release this on the xbox maybe some of the control issues could be worked out before then this game had so much potential that right now it is not living up to
1,i ve had this system for over a year and it does in fact work as advertised i follow the procedure as described by mr pruss and end up with little or no water spots you do have to pay particular attention to any nooks where unfiltered tap water can accumulate and but sure to flush them well with filtered water in that last step failure to do so may end up with a trickle of unfiltered water running down the car as it dries i also echo the complaints about the soap compartment cap and lack of a good on off trigger with the really hard water we have in so cal i get maybe vehicles washed on one filter cartridge i find it takes about half the time to wash my car and truck with this system vs drying by hand one other observation the soap compartment has a line for maximum fill i got the impression the time i accidently went way over that line that a little soap was being dispensed along with unfiltered and filtered rinse water or maybe soap was just oozing out of the contraption and getting into the rinse water that way otherwise i m surprised how happy i am with it

1,this is one of the few toys it seems which has remained fundamentally unchanged since we were children the push stick is shaped a little differently i remember a thin blue broom stick with an orange or red handle but otherwise it is the same no electronic sounds or flashing lights have been added although you can get it that way too if you want personally i think these things detract from the imagination building aspects of certain toys i m not saying we have no talking or musical or flashing toys but it dismays me when these things are added to the classics think little people farm etc what i love about this toy is it can be anything it s a sweeper it s a carpet cleaner it s a mop it never fails to crack me up when my son comes running after me with his corn popper when i am cleaning it s a lawnmower so many jobs around the house or yard can be copied with the corn popper and if mom or dad isn t up to much it s still great fun to run around with which means exercise for the kiddies it s a solo toy and a playing with other kids toy any time we have other children over to play the corn popper comes out as they chase each other about the house we got this toy when my son was months he is now and still playing with this toy i have seen and year olds still playing with the corn popper there are few toys that are so simple and yet offer so much fun sturdy too very important as it s bound to be crashed into a few walls i can t think of another toy which will give you more bang for your buck unless you count dirt and measuring spoons and all those other free things that kids so exasperatingly pick over the toys you paid good money for i am a little alarmed at the current price listed for this toy though you should not need to pay that much for it occasionally this item becomes hard to find especially at christmas but usually there are tons of them in the stores for around the cost of a president hamilton right now this is listed for twice that

1,walzer s historical approach to examining just war theory is i think the most useful way to understand morality in war that is so because empirical facts back up all the philosophical evaluations walzer describes experience and draws conslusions here he is laying a philosophical foundation and implying if not prescribing moral norms from which the rules have been extracted be forewarned he does not cut the reader any slack this book requires some serious attention to the author s train of thought just war theory has two categories the justice of going to war and the justice of fighting once in a war walzer s discussion usefully and clearly separates the two and examines via historical events what we regard as right and wrong within each sphere in doing this he has done the modern world a tremendous service his logical breakdown speaks to thousands of years of tradition about what thinkers have considered right and wrong in war one of the best outcomes of this landmark work is the complete debunking of the notion that all is fair in love and war that is the path of least moral resistance or as clausewitz would say friction yet we all know that soldiers are honored for fighting well and loathed for behaving like armed thugs and murderers what is amazing from the discusion is the realization that walzer knows he has to attack that age old notion something our collective sense of justice has historically always rejected yet it remains a prevailing idea for many originally coined by the romans it seems walzer quotes them in war the laws are silent they themselves were self consciously contrite over the fates they inflicted on the greeks and carthginians the book rates five stars for rigorously addressing this issue alone some make the mistake of thinking walzer is a pacifist far from it on the otherside some critics find his argument about supreme emergency a moral failure and a cop out the case of nazi germany is his paradigmatic case of supreme emergency one where normal rules may be relaxed if ever so little because of the especially pernicious nature of state sponsored genocide the same relaxation of restraints would likely apply to islamic terror in contrast walzer does not see imperial japan for instance as having represented a supreme emergency and so the atomic bombings and the fire bombings of cities could not be morally justified readers may want to compare his view to paul fussell s perspective in the essay thank god for the atom bomb significantly for current events readers interested in the distinction between pre emptive and preventive war will find a well articulated argument here the us attack on iraq was and still is often justified as pre emptive that impulse on the part of the neo conservatives who devised or whipped up the casus belli reflects i think a need to cloak a morally questionable war in the robes of legitimacy there is no way that attack can be justified under the historically accepted norms of pre emption michael walzer s well thought distinction between pre emption and prevention makes sense even in the milieu of asymmetric warfare against terror and islamic radicalism and it clearly shows why the iraq war was a moral mistake from the start regardless of its practical success down the road if we are fortunate enough to see that the moral precedent of engaging in preventive war will continue to haunt america long into the future the fact that iraq was not even on the spectrum where the fine line between pre emption and prevention exists is a telling aspect of the overall ongoing strategic fiasco where one fails to recognize the moral high ground one is doomed to moral failure walzer was vocal about the run up to war in and those who read his book would do well to find his comments about the iraq invasion they are edifying in terms of understanding the overall argument and where we are going in this role as the world s police force
0,the watch obviously looks nice and the links have a nice unique design unfortunately i have had terrible issues with the pins between the links there are multiple links that wiggle out throughout the day and i have to shimmy them back in all day long i tried having this issue addressed with a jeweler but it didn t last this is the kind of issue i would expect from an inferior watch perhaps one well under bucks

1,i rec d this today i had been looking for a while for a white faced stainless watch and kept coming back to this one from bulova i looked for nearly two years i did some looking around online and in stores and amazon by far had the best price they beat everyone by at least so i did what any girl would do i bought it it is a substantial watch it s not a watch for someone looking for something dainty or unassuming i don t think it s heavy it just feels like you ve got a watch on i personally like the size and weight i plan on this being my spring summer watch until it dies or something happens to it i have a seiko coutura with a black mop face w diamonds that i love but i wanted something different but sort of the same and this one was it

1,pictures via camera reflect not only what the photographer sees but what he thinks about the most successful reflect an understanding of things as much as their image and jerry thompson s exploration of the relationship between seeing and thinking in truth and photography provides a set of fine duotone photos to illustrate essays reflecting on working photography experiences
1,i will not repeat what other reviews have stated already all the reviews below are pretty much correct with this camera being a high quality and easy to use etc etc the only issue is focusing on a small target such as a name brand logo inside a rolex watch it is hard even in manual mode and i actually have alot of digital camera experience forget trying to focus in auto mode it won t happen at least not without alot of tinkering and stress if you need to take alot of close up pictures of small detailed items jewelery insects etc then i recommend buying a digital slr camera nikon is a good one this fuji you are looking at here is perfect for taking pictures of normal things like people cars buildings sites etc

0,i have been using paperport since it came from my visioneer scanner for about years and since then upgraded a few versions after reading hyped up product features of version from nuance website i cannot justify upgrading my paperport software to pro given its current cost i am pretty sure that a lot more people especially loyal users like me would snap it up if it was little cheaper i will probably wait for some time for price to go down it will also need time to stabilize no patches yet and become compatible with vista for those of you who got lotsa money please send me some i would recommend paperport as a decent doc managment s w

0,my son received this as a christmas gift he and his brother and dad were excited got all set up to build it and got nothing but frustration these are really mechanically minded guys too very disappointing i was especially surprised because of the smithsonian name on it you d think they would test this stuff before allowing their name on it my guys never got as far as the reviewer who eventually got it assembled the screws stripped and we didn t have the appropriate glue to even attempt a rescue it simply would not assemble the way it was advertised i am calling amazon tomorrow about a refund

1,in this part of the world weather forecasts are either scarce or highly inaccurate so far this product has worked great its forecasts are quite accurate so you can plan on taking an umbrella with you in the car if it predicts rain or if you need to wear your bermudas to enjoy the sunshine i had an indoor outdoor thermometer manufactured by radio shack and this unit can actually read that outdoor sensor so the addition of the two sensors that come with this unit allowed me to know the temperature indoors and in my patio garage and the kid s bedrooms

1,this magazine is great for sport specific magazines this is probably one of the best that i have seen yes the photos are large and detailed but the kicker is the writing incredible content without being wordy variety of topics and approaches brings out varying highlights of the sport just very impressive
0,i bought this for my year old to practice hitting although well built it is poorly designed the place where the hit a way attaches is not logical and causes interference with the legs the cables on the hit a way are so stiff that the ball loses velocity quickly and does not wrap and come back around for the hit you might get one or two hits in before it is unusable a giant waste of money the only reason i give it stars is the construction is solid
0,it came within one week of being ordered it is an excellent product and is as advertised i received a manual for sony s compact disc recorder instead of the manual for the

1,this spring is of industrial strength it can definitely support a heavy weight punching bag of to lbs better than any made available at your local hardware store it s only about in long so it does not take up much space however if your ceiling beams are not structurally sound no spring coil can adequately prevent damage to them by absorbing the shock of using a heavy bag
0,i knew i was in trouble with four brothers when i saw that josh howard of sports night fame was scowling hard trying to be a tough detroit cop not believable for a nanosecond and then it got worse when marky mark said why don t you two cops get some doughnuts and coffee the rest of the film veers along in that kind of lame and rhythm almost every scene in this thing is a howler and watching it i remembered i hadn t forgiven tyrese gibson for the travesty that was fast furious still tyrese is better than garrett hedlund who looks like he s a refugee from the outsiders but the movie s not a total wash after all it s got a great soundtrack

0,do you know why this double cd is often in the bargain basement simply because it is an inferior product for some very odd reason the compiler at the record company decided to put live songs instead of the studio versions that we all remember for all we know it may have been a copyright problem i bought this for my dad about years ago but we were both unaware of the live recordings until we played it the live recordings on this cd are dismal and not related to the awesome hot august night fortunately for me i own the right neil diamond cd s which contain the studio versions these are still available the first is called greatest hits a black and white photo a young neil and the second is called greatest hits volume a colour photo of neil sitting on a sofa both of these contain all the studio versions and not one live recording in sight just released is a new compilation called neil diamond gold as part of the gold series but i do not know if it too contains the dreadful live recordings all i know is that it is missing a lot of key tracks
0,i was a little afraid to try this after reading some of the reviews but the list of ingredients sounded wonderful so i gave it a try i love it it s surprising it changes on me when i first put it on it takes on a white floral scent when i first applied it i was surprised that it seemed like a floral but hours later i was smelling vanilla i was very surprised to realize it was me very interesting very cool lighter than the original poison it may become my spring summer choice

0,i too bought this on vhs for vincent d onofrio my only negative comment about his performance is that there s not enough of it i ll say right here and now that i m not a big fan of smits or scacchi and d onofrio overpowers them every time he s on screen it s a beautiful story and i can see why director gillian armstrong was attracted to it it is a love story with a bit of real life depth rather than those soapy ones where the ridiculous problems are created by the characters for lack of imagination julia roberts films anyone that being said the two lead roles needed to be played by stronger actors and ones that could keep up with d onofrio vivacity worth a look for fans
0,i value the amazon product reviews and have purchased many items based on customer feedback i purchased this phone from home depot for i am returning it today it is to large for comfort the reception is bad the letters too small for those of us who need reading glasses i could go on

0,i picked up the book at a yardsale without knowing much about it and absolutely loved it it is so smart funny and heartbreaking without ever being sappy so naturally i was curious about the movie too i figured that because ephron had written the screenplay too not much could go wrong and while the story line followed the book more or less the movie turned out terrible i could not have been more disappointed first of all jack nicholson is completely miscast because he essentially plays himself as usual not the interesting guy that mark is supposed to be he is the opposite of charming funny tender lovable i e somebody that the character of the wife rachel would fall so deeply in love with and trust so completely you suspect all along that he is a cad therefore rachel s utter shock at his betrayal doesn t make sense besides he is too old for the role meryl streep is annoyingly twitchy but much better in her role as rachel still she can t carry the movie alone and her love scenes with nicholson are flat there is no spark there i wonder how happy ephron was with the movie adaptation of her novel and whether she really did write all the scenes the wedding scene where rachel has doubts about marying mark and spends what feels like hours in a room alone agonizing while the wedding guests wait is out of place not to mention boring not to mention heavy handed a total dud
0,this item is cheap junk i bought this item and when i got it it didn t work and after hours of fiddling with it it finally worked but the sound was terrible and when i pulled the plug out of the back after a day it said it was chargable but it wasn t it would not work without the plug attached to it and when i started to play it it kept making this annoying banjo like sound and it wouldn t stop and you can not play any fast songs on this because it can t keep up and you can not play more than one note at a time and the keys aren t really raised it is just like pressing cell phone buttons and the plastic is so cheep it almost broke when i pressed one button and after shipping and handling the total was about do not buy this item cheap junk if you want a roll up keyboard go look somewhere else
1,i have been a brickman fan since the very first album much of his early songs were uplifting piano solos without much electronic enhancement escape is a wonderful album full of songs you might find on his early albums there are three excellent vocals on the cd that will please fans who favor his more recent work which tends to feature the vocalist over the piano if you are a brickman fan this is a must have album
0,i picked this item up for my year old nephew who loves science we put it together one night and i was surprised to find that the base and volcano are incredibly thin plastic that crack under any pressure at all the plaster sand mixture was impossible to work with it just balled up into clumps and there was no real way of spreading it around smoothly we both ended up with plaster all over us once it had dried he was excited to get to paint it as soon as he began to paint parts of the plaster started breaking off in chunks hooking the plastic tubing up was not a major problem but i had issues keeping it hooked together the pump system was supposed to send vinegar into a baking soda chamber to push up into the volcano instead the pump which was a squeeze bottle pushed the vinegar weakly upwards and then once it hit the baking soda chamber it clogged up when it finally made its way out through the volcano after me squeezing the bottle as hard as possible it barely trickled out once it had trickled enough the rest of the plaster fell off as it got wet he and his sisters just looked at me and asked is that it after three tries we trashed the whole thing also the rock samples that they give you in the kit are the size of the tip of your fingernail i m a geologist and these are not rare expensive rocks there was no reason to not include larger samples he was very disappointed in the whole thing and so was i i can t believe that the smithsonian put their name on this product we ll go back to our plaster volcano with vinegar and baking soda
1,this is a great collection of hits from the s it is packed with hits it is a great addition to a s hits collection
1,discipleship journal does what many other christian magazines do not do it provides instruction and challenges the reader to be directly and fully engaged in a christ focused faith while others may talk about christianity dj asks you to pursue christ through responding to scripture this isn t an evangelistic magazine like decision or an encouraging magazine per se like moody it is for the christian looking to grow in his or her faith by examining themselves and what god s word says it is not for the passive pew sitter this for the christian who wants his or her faith to impact the days between sundays there is nothing watered down here it is published by navpress who like their counterparts the college ministry navigators know the crucial necessity of biblical study by the everyday christian whether it is a discussion about satan s favorite lies how to study a particular book of the bible or an explanation of what prayer is an is not dj is the sort of publication that will cause you to pause mid page and realize something new about our lord and his ways this is a great tool for two or three people to use together even a small group to go through the articles week by week and discuss them and what this means in real life i ve even heard of ccd and sunday school classes asking everyone to read selections from a certain issue as fodder for the next week s class i fully recommend discipleship journal expect your faith to grow anthony trendl editor hungarianbookstore co
1,i am very happy with it but it doesn t live up to my expectations i also have the reg plus for xp and i really don t think the extra money is worth it if i were to do over i would still have bought the plus superpack for xp but not the regular plus just because i do have a media center pc if i didn t have that the regular plus for xp would have been just fine

1,i needed a lens hood for my lens and paying for a hood on a lens might seem ridiculous however that might be because the lens is so inexpensive if the lens was then paying an extra might not seem too bad i just saw the total cost of the lens and hood for and that s good for a terrific prime lens and its hood however please note the lens hood is rather shallow star reduction and it is a screw on two piece kit star reduction one piece is the adaptor that screws on where the filters normally go uv filter in front of the lens and is intended to be a permanent integral part of the lens and the second piece is the hood that snaps on and off this adaptor the adaptor ring retains the same rim size so your protective filter can go before or after the adaptor bonus star because is still a bargain for a super fast super sharp super clear light weight beginner lens and hood kit i hope this helps rather than confuse
1,i have been a long time user of delorme products but decided to get a combination of microsoft products both for the us and europe autotrip the program loaded very smoothly but do make sure you load the program before plugging in the gps locator there are multiple warnings about this as well as what to do if you don t follow directions i loaded all the data on my laptop so i would not have to carry the dvd the setup was also quite simple there are warnings about usage in an automobile that pop up in use as well as the cautions during setup one needs to keep this in mind and not be distracted when driving i set the mapping program and forget it but it works best with two people in the car with one to navigate the gps locator has a great chipset very very sensitive and quickly finds the coordinates within seconds even as i sit in my house it rarely loses a lock on the satellite the route finding works well so far you can save your track as well as the route but unlike the delorme products you can t playback your track or if you can i have not found it the screen is pleasing and you go fullscreen i haven t tried voice recognition but the spoken commands are about average the ability ot overlay satellite photographs when planning routes with an internet connection is a plus plus you can routinely update road construction sites so far no opinion on how good that feature is the microsoft location finder internet leaves something to be desired though i ve only tried it at home it routinely thinks i m in china which is interesting because so many ads are quite able to figure out where i am the gps also works with other programs by selecting a generic nema gps there are other optional equipment to go with the gps if you ve never used a gps mapping program with a laptop microsoft s t is a good choice just don t be surprised if the gps lcates you accurately and the microsoft locator product puts you on the other side of the planet
1,this book introduces us to the colorful world of a bygone era that of border radio brilliant technicians constructed gargantuan transmitters along the border towns of texas mexico and beamed their signal into all of north america one angry resident complained that was all he could get on his radio these stations were distinguished by their call signs that began with an x this spawned an industry of singers politicians preachers and pitchman the type we now see on infomercials mail was the barometer of the day the more mail you pulled in from listeners the more clout you carried with stations keep those cards and letters coming new federal regulations put an end to this wild world but not until the airwaves crackled with everyone from wolfman jack to the rev ike get out of the ghetto and get into the get mo this is a marvelously written treasure trove that will be welcomed by anyone interested in radio salesmanship and american sub cultures and the bizarre

1,this is hawking s attempt to write about complicated physics for those of us who did not do well in math and therefore did not take the advanced sciences requiring ability in math while still not an easy read it it much easier than the brief history of time that he wrote for laypeople before this a person who wants to know what the current scientific thinking is about the nature of the universe will find it worth spending the time it takes to read and digest this book as they will be reading about it from one of the leading scientists in this field older teens who have some interest in sciences may also find this to be a helpful introduction to the concepts they think they want to study in depth
1,herman wouk s book winds of war became a bestseller upon its publication just like its sequel war and remembrance a few years later these thick books joining the fictional and historical events during second world war provided the subject matter for one of the greatest achievements in the history of the tv miniseries this dvd set covers the first book with an hour series shot in the plot concerns a military family named henry scattered and absorbed by the winds of war we follow the patriarch victor pug henry robert mitchum an experienced military officer who in the spring is appointed to be a military attaché for the usa in berlin he is accompanied by his dotty and yet quite likable wife rhoda polly bergen their children include an oldest son the flyboy warren ben murphy another son byron jan michael vincent who is in italy and falls in love with a bit older jewish girl natalie ali mcgraw who is the niece of the famous american jewish writer dr aaron jastrow john houseman the daughter madeleine lisa eilbacher is the youngest of the three and works as a radio girl in berlin pugh gets the hint of the atmosphere in the nazi germany of that time like the fact jews are treated second class and predicts the upcoming pact between hitler günter meisner and stalin both of who he gets to meet during the series byron and natalie witness the first days of war being caught in the midst of warsaw where natalie followed her fiancé the american diplomat leslie slote david dukes the series mixes the lives of the henrys with the historical events of the war the occupations of poland and france the blitz in london the nazi invasion of the soviet union the beginnings of the final solution behind the lines of the occupied russian territory the japanese attack on pearl harbor to name a few the last episode of this first part of the story ends with the aftermath of pearl harbor the german offensive is halted on the outskirts of moscow pug goes to command a battleship and fight in the war unsure of his feelings for the beautiful daughter of an old friend victoria tennant byron fights in the submarine while in the meantime natalie who fell in love with byron and bore him a son is left onboard a ship in naples which is awaiting to live for palestine since she and her uncle could not find their way out of fascist italy due to his passport complications the above is just the basic description of the series and despite of what it may seem it is not a soap opera but rather an interesting chronicle of the war and a family influenced by its impact pug henry gets to meet all the important players of the war churchill hitler roosevelt stalin and in this respect is somewhat similar to young indiana jones the war itself is shown from these two viewpoints the henrys and the rest of the fictional characters vs the historical ones hitler and his generals etc there are many things that make this show one of the miniseries highlights of its time one of them is the excellent casting robert mitchum brings his renowned charisma for the character of pug and he does it in an excellent way ali macgraw s headstrong natalie makes a fine contrast to jan michael vincent s younger byron the historical characters are done more than convincingly thusly ralph bellamy is the definite fdr a role he had an opportunity to play years before in the theatre and howard lang makes a believable churchill one must make a special reference to günter meisner and his portrayal of adolf hitler as it will be seen in the sequel the director and producer dan curtis wanted hitler to be overplayed the reasons remain unknown and one can only guess that he wanted to make it less human in this way günter meisner the late german actor who played hitler few times during his career although a bit too old for the role managed to keep things under control so despite the fact his führer is stiffed and not altogether perfect he manages to give a hint of the evil personage hitler was this is important to note since his successor to the role for war and remembrance the british actor steven berkoff was awful playing the character as a total one dimensional yelling buffoon the role of hitler is a hard and yet manageable task for an actor who can make a character as shown by bruno ganz in the recent movie downfall one of the other appeals of the show is the fact it was shot on location with attention put to details that make the historical accuracy most scenes were shot in my hometown zagreb the capital of croatia then still part of ex yugoslavia the producers managed to use zagreb s past as one of the former austro hungarian capitals to recreate berlin lisbon warsaw etc the scenery and the costumes evoke the era perfectly thus making the whole thing believable to the viewer other locations included usa italy and some more but the greatest asset is without the doubt the interesting plot which doesn t let go for a moment it is also noticeable that some of the mistakes that were made in the sequel war and remembrance the narrow scope of the victims of the holocaust being one of them are not present here one can only get a hint of some of the future slips here for example the subtle message that all the germans are bad and all americans good this dvd collection of the series deserves a seven dvds come packed in a nice sleeve besides the series there are several interesting extra features through the interviews with the cast crew and herman wouk we learn about the process of adaptation casting shooting and the problems they all encountered while making this epic peace some of the footage includes things shot during the work on location in zagreb for anyone enjoying modern history an excellent miniseries with the interesting plot or is simply interested in second world war this is a must have highly recommendable

0,every once in a while i like to pick up a book that is outside the realm of usual reading and look for a surprise or spark to keep the fires of imagination from dying out it is with this mindset i picked up wouldn t take nothing for my journey now and what did i find as a result of my maverick literary exploration ehh ms angelou may not take anything for her journey but based on the cover price she will take to tell you a bit about it and even this may not even seem like that bad a deal were it not for the fact that either her journey was bland her insights wanting or her conclusions misguided whatever the cause this book is dreadful if you are looking for the usual meaningless new age spiritual gobble gook i e about boundaries respect finding ones direction learning what it means to be a women etc then this journey is for you but if you see this nonsense as the nonsense it is you will be best served my buckling up your shoes and journeying elsewhere

1,i just bought this waterproof case in order to use my canon on a scuba diving trip i was a little nervous at first i could see me scrapping the camera after it got soaked to the bone but i have to say that the waterproof case performed admirably i used it on dives and all of them were to depths of feet i did not have one leak a word of caution i followed instructions and coated the seal of the camera with a fine coat of silicon gel just a small amount i would like to think that the camera would not leak without this but i did not want to take any chances i would recommend this case to anyone who wants to use their canon camera on dive trips or excursions at the beach

1,i read the reviews about people saying their watch scratched and lost paint on it mine has not done this with the exception of the clasp since the watch and band are titanium it should be anondized meaning it s not going to come off however the clasp and a few other small parts watch hands are made of stainless steel so they will start losing their finish after awhile after wearing this watch for a few weeks i went and put on my old stainless steel citizen watch it felt huge and felt like it weighed a ton i went and weighed each of them the citizen came in around while the skagen came in at around it is also very thin i used to not be able to wear a watch since typing on a computer all day the band would irritate me have not had any problems with the skagen one other thing to note the picture for this item shows the steel watch you can see it on the face if you want to see a picture of the titanium one take the product number and go to skagen s site or google the skagen lost a star because of the paint coming off the clasp not the band

0,this is a new low even for our feminazi drenched anti culture the whole message of this whore of a doll is to tell impressionable little girls that being superficial arrogant shallow and slutty are positive attributes desirable healthy and that by contrast having true strength of character integrity honor and modesty are for losers in other words looking and behaving like a skank tramp empowerment that term has been so misued over the last years and particularly the last that it ceases to have any truth to it whatsoever barbie used to epitomize what it meant to be feminine a lady and fulfilled with a husband a home and children now that standard has been completely perverted and ruined with the onset of dolls like this exchanging true values being a good wife and mother for false ones materialism and promiscuity even barbie s face has been uglified grossly overdone mascara eyeliner and collagened out lips resembling those hideous whored out bratz dolls realize this is a war on our children s souls mattel should be ashamed of themselves to the hilt this is child abuse pure and simple any mother who allows their child to get one of these monstrosities should be jailed for neglect and have her tubes tied
0,bought they don t work the batteries do not last we are trying to return them
0,this case looks good and protects the camera adequately but is too bulky it hasn t got a lot of room inside i was unable to fit an extra sd card in its little case and a spare battery the belt clip is difficult to use and i end up carrying the case in my hand most of the time there are better cases for this camera
1,this nature made product is excellent however readers should be aware that this products does not contain iron for a very good reason taking iron supplements sets you up for potential health problems if you are a woman over i hope the other reviewer takes note of this

1,i bought this product to hang a lcd i am pleased with this mount but there are some concerns the mount is only wide the virtual axis tilt is basically a clip that can be added on to obtain a degree tilt which working perfect for me there are only two tilt options with this mount vertical hugs wall nicely and the degree being wide you will not hit studs if they are centers make sure you get at least studs my experience is this mount does not support vesa pattern is inches and the brackets can not be spaced more than apart my tv did have another attaching pattern but i had to use the bolts provided with mount i would feel safer if this mount did support the spacing where i could use the thicker bolts a lcd isn t going to weigh as much as a tv so take that into consideration i am still pleased with this product as it is very sturdy
1,this hammock is made of soft cotton string it is extra large and very strong you need foot span to hang it taunt which gives you enough room for the whole famil
1,cajun cuisine is without a doubt the best cajun cookbook that i ve ever used i was born and reared in southern louisiana and the recipes detailed within closely mirror the exact techniques seasonings and spices that i had learned by watching both my grandmothers in their kitchens and how i was personally taught by my grandfather at his hunting camp you cannot go wrong with this book jacque
0,the sound quality was excellent but the earpiece is flimsy and irreplacable terrific electrical engineering poor mechanical engineering i loved it when it wasn t broken even wind didn t seem to bother the headset much the voice quality was great on transmission and reception but the earpiece is incredibly flimsy and can t be replaced i got a new headset the first time on warranty the second time it broke i could have gotten a free replacement again but i didn t want the hassle i have a scala now that i ve been using for months and i m very happy with it even though the sound and wind immunity doesn t measure up to the logitech
1,reasons to buy it cheap a mere packed with features from complete auto mode point and shoot to fully manual mode and optical zoom good enough for most situations picture quality is good it s better than the other two cameras i own olympus uz and sony dsc compact it s smaller than it looks in the stock photo fast switches on and is ready for the first shot within about seconds other things i liked about the camera good ergonomics fits nicely in my hand all the buttons are well placed and easy to access i can even switch on the camera and take pictures with one hand powerful flash enough to fill up a moderate size room great video mode with sound it also comes with an audio video cable so that you can connect the camera to your tv and watch the vidoes and pictures on your tv lcd is decent size and is fairly bright which means it s even visible outdoors in the daytime things i didn t like about the camera manual could be more detailed there is a bsaic manual and sort of a quick start guide but there was no page booklet which explained each and every feature in detail the auto focus illuminator for help in focussing in low light is a little bright and can be annoying sometimes but the upside is that you get good focus even in really low light conditions does not come with a battery charger i bought rechargeable batteries and a charger separately i have owned the olympus uz and the newer sony dsc but i think this camera is better than both of them
1,julieta venegas did it again she scored an album that is not alternative in style however it is very catchy pop music her melodies are perfect for a morning drive with the radio on you can sing along and express day to day feelings julieta continues to use instruments i like such as the harmonica and of course julietas nice character and her lovely behavior shine through in her public appearances my personal favorite is me voy a very positive song about a not so positive event breaking up keep up the good work julieta your songs are appreciated
1,definitely a wonderful book for those following the teachings of the other books this book provides more useful information the path that castaneda elucidated is fraught with controvery and extreme views read the other reviews i found it useful to read and judge for myself what castaneda wrote about is not fiction however it is a difficult path that very few ever advance upon thus the angry reviews of those calling castaneda a fraud due to their own failure its also a path that those given to fantasy and believing in their own specialness jump on and thus follow blindly with no lasting gains making up their experience as they go and making sure others hear about it definitely not a path for everyone but certainly open to sober verification also a great book for those looking for a well written and gripping book i believe castaneda s genius as well as his contribution to mankind is yet to be fully appreciated i am grateful for the gift of his writings and wisdom
0,but over the last years it has just become another muscle mag that uses t a to prop up its bodybuilders i m surprised its still around
0,thr pros about this album s that there alot of tight rappers and beats the cons about this album is that clue calls himself a dj but he s a dumb phony who doesn t know when to shut his mouth all he does is yell out throughout the whole album saying stupid stuff and giving shoutouts while the rappers rap he nees o shut up an lets us hear the song if u want this album still go copy it off the net cause the is not worth the money ohyeah he dosen t even scratc
0,for those of you looking for more eva action after seeing the original series take heed don t buy this dvd the death part of the dvd part is nothing but a terrible rehashing of scenes from the regular season and the second half rebirth part is new stuff very good but if you buy the end of evangelion you get rebirth and a much better and easier to understand ending to the whole series in completely new material so don t buy death rebirth buy the end of evangelion instead
1,the other reviews can reveal what this book is about what i wanted to share is the extreme responses this book incited in my boyfriend and me he alternately found himself loving the narrator yuriko s sister for her brutal honesty and hating her for her malice and psychological bullying of kazue meanwhile i found myself rooting the narrator on as she spoke the cruel truth about the pitiful hopelessness of kazue s meritocratic dreams but a moment later i wondered if that made me a bully myself or as bitter and heartless as the narrator perhaps it reminded me too much of what i had seen growing up to shock me then there was the simultaneous hilarity and pain of kazue s cluelessness was she a tragic figure blind or both i admired kirino for inspiring me to feel so much for her characters even for yuriko who is certainly not the ditsy airhead her older sister wants us to believe she is i also found it hard to believ she was as ghastly as she considered herself in her is it just because women past in japan are regarded as christmas cake as a friend from japan says my attention was quite strained by zhang s tale of chinese hardship it seemed the wrong book to educate the reader about how difficult it is for immigrants in japan but i immediately forgave kirino when yuriko s older sister admitted herself zhang s account was tedious and could be skipped i d recommend others to skim it as well again my patience was tested by kazue s journal i just kept on thinking aren t you ready to die yet but i see this was intentional on kirino s part to make the reader struggle between our or my wanting kazue to just give up on life and our feeling ashamed for our coldness and complicity in her bullying it also made my boyfriend and me think concurrently of the people we loved in our own lives who were heading towards the same fate as kazue and yuriko not through prostitution but through drugs what did disappoint me in the end was the last chapter which seemed a cop out if only an editor had suggested it was unconvincing and encouraged her that an alternative though more shocking would be more in line with the narrator s character but that is wishful thinking on my part when i give this book to others which i will i will make sure to discuss with them when they ve finished what they thought of the ending this book could have been edited down a hundred pages back when it was written in japanese but for what it did offer i have no regrets for its consuming my attention entirely and will always look forward to further translations of kirino s books this book may not be the masterpiece out was but for anyone who has gone to an elite school on scholarship striven to remain a petite zero wanted to excel while recognizing how off the mark our values of judgment are or wondered just how much her body could be worth reading grotesque is just as powerful an experience as reading out was
0,long studio sessions if you want a truly incoherent album strung together in a twisted way then this is it if you don t get near the beginning or rock roll get some of their quality stuff this definitely isn t it
0,the friend who i purchased this for was not able to use it because it moved too fast for her to keep up with she is used to a two wheeled walker but wanted one with a seat she didn t keep the original packaging so could not get a full refund it turned out that return shipping was going to be more than what she would get for a refund so she didn t return it the lesson better buy local if you re not sure

0,i bought this seat for my fifth child she loved it at first but then about the second week we had it the plastic at the top of one of the legs snapped as i was putting her in it luckily i had not let go of her yet because the whole thing fell apart on the floor the rattle ball also broke off within the first couple of weeks upon investigation the company only offers a day warranty and that does not cover material failure i will not buy anything else from this company not only are their products poor they are down right dangerous

1,we not only use this for roasts we cradle chicken turkey and pork rolls for cooking also we have been pleased so far the nickel plated steel rack cleans easily too
0,after i ordered this product one of my co workers told me about the reviews on amazon i checked it out and i was really surprised the reviews are poor the worst part though is that the product is listed three times what s the deal a product gets a bad review so they re list it more bad reviews and they re list it again see for yourself do a general search for hylexin and you will see several listings of the same product trying to out run bad reviews i now think less of the product and amazon shame on you both
1,it costs less than the canon la conversion lens adapter and it s metal not plastic need to say more
1,this product is very easy to install and use in couple of minutes i was able to set it up i used the phone jack to input the music from cassette player to the computer and it worked well the reason i give it four star out of five is that it records the music in wave format and there is no software in the package that converts wave file to dvd cd format
0,i bought this product on the strength of the norton name and a positive review in business week i uninstalled zonelabs ad aware and all norton anti virus there were still nav files after the uninstall i had to download their norton software removal tool which also could not remove some nav files everytime i re boot those problematic nav files want to re launch nav the nis install was still difficult after all of that effort and once installed nis either freezes up my computer or makes my internet connection so slow that it is un usable so now i ve uninstalled nis still have issues with the corrupt nav files and will being go back to zonelabs and ad aware

0,this booklet has a lot of warner brothers drawings but it doesn t delve into the specifics of creating animation very well i d recommend getting the animator s survival kit instead as it has tons of good and well explained info on the art of creating your own animation
1,i ordered these for my month old daughter and was a little nervous i had never bought earrings on line before i wanted something with the safety backs but i had expereince with some backs that screw themselves off i loved the butterflies and wanted to try them my daughter has had them in her ears for a few weeks now and we haven t had any problems i keep checking the backs and they are on nice and tight i wanted a good quality earring so she didn t have problems with infections and we havent i will definately order from here again
1,maybe it s because i was upgrading from an older version but i found the new features to be very good for example the junk mail feature works better than any other i have used it was catching junk from the very beginning and has missed very few things i have only had one thing put in the junk folder that was not junk email also the security features are far superior to the version and the calendar is more flexible and easier to use installation was seemless i think it might be a little overpriced but considering how long i will keep it it s not too bad

0,this was the only bertrice small book i could find in the gift shop of an airport that should have been warning enough not to buy it rosamund was an unlikeable character she left her young daughters so she could make love constantly and then was oh so superior with her maid when annie did the same i guess being a rich snotty noblewoman means you re not held to the same standards of behavior as the mere household help i found the love at first sight meeting to be flimsy and contrived small s readers are smarter than most so i m surprised she expected us to swallow it like some other reviewers here i thought it was more lust than love it was clearly a mid life crisis hook up for patrick and if rosamund truly loved patrick she never would have left him when he was ill memory loss or not not planning to read either rosamund or phillipa the other books in this series it was hard enough getting through this book let alone another one with her uppity daughter the good stuff getting to meet patrick leslie again but it was heartbreaking to witness his grief over losing his daughter janet decades ago if you ve read the kadin you know that janet eventually returns to her home but only after patrick has died
0,amanda pete is sexy and there was a bit of nudity but otherwise this film did nothing for me a bunch of guys who get together once a week and talk about their conquests i can t even relate and they re trying to convince me that women are just as ruthless in their hornyness yeah right see it if you re a big fan of fart jokes or whatever
0,it s not very accurate because the sleep function sometimes takes some time to wake up but what was worse was that after i owned it for two weeks the thing stopped working it was never dropped or damaged in anyway it just stopped the display just faded away and wouldn t work again even with a new battery this one was such a waste of money i ll definately buy a different brand next time
1,i received this for christmas from my amazon wishlist i wanted to give it a couple of months of use before reviewing i was a long time user of norelco shavers but switched to a blade since i couldn t get a close enough shave now that the whiskers are mostly gray you can t tell for a few days if i shaved or not so closeness is no longer an issue i typically use this shaver in the shower and have noticed that if you wash your face first it takes more of the cool skin creme to give a smooth close shave just a hint guys for the most part this shaver does a good job of getting around the wrinkles dimples and adam s apple cleanly with very little drag my only complaint is that the trimmer head is a separate attachment and that makes it difficult to trim the stash sideburns while showering small complaint that doesn t remove any ratings stars all in all a great shaver
0,i am so disappointed i ordered this scent after hearing about it from friends and reading great reviews all of the reviews i read mentioned the lack of staying power that this product has but i never expected the product to be so extraordinarily weak don t get me wrong i do not want my fragrance to enter a room before i do after all it is not the s anymore lol but i also do not want to have to sniff my wrist so hard to detect the scent that i take off skin the scent is beautiful i would love to wear it but minutes after i sprayed it on i could barely detect the fragrance as sometimes it is harder to smell your own perfume i asked my hubby and friends for their opinions they could barely smell it either i would happily wear this scent every day if i could enjoy it at all if philosophy can create this scent with staying power they will have a customer for life as it stands now i would not recommend anyone buy this product it is a very disappointing waste of money
1,great improvements over the original dvd enhanced for tvs with scenes that are now clearer and actually widescreen ratio the original dvd claims an aspect ratio of approximately which was not true i own both versions and have compared viewing aspects of each clearly this dvd is far superior and well worth the purchase price this plays very well on my hdtv monitor i ll give the old version to someone w an old tv

0,oh how i wanted to love devon s book he was such a charming rascal in wicked and such a bore in sinful there was no meat to this story the back of the books summarizes it nicely what would have made a better short story in an anthology was dragged on for over pages i admit i only made through about half before skimming and realizing it wasn t going to get any better there s no sizzling tension the love scenes weak and the mystery is predictable i had such high expectations for this boscastle book since drake s was brilliant and devon s character seemed such a lovable rogue not a keeper for me
0,wow this toy was made as cheap as possible shame on crayola for not spending the extra pennies to make this more durable and a better quality product great concept but poor designers steps aside crayola your name doesn t stand for much anymore
0,the diamonds sold by this company contain heavy carbon deposits as a result the diamonds are dark in color and don t sparkle like one would expect for the money paid i m still waiting to receive a full refund after returning almost weeks ago i do not recommend purchasing from this company if you re looking for a diamond that truly catches the eye
1,review by mike watson with the recent slew of victory records releases not to mention the wide variety one can be to say the least skeptical of any of their assortment of new releases however picking through all of the less notable releases from the label the up and coming band the forecast have stepped to the plate and scored a home run on late night conversations the forecast are a perfect blend of male and female vocals over a very modern rock soundtrack executed flawlessly over a ten song full length late night conversations is an album confronting different topics ranging from relationships to the teen trend of mutilation and loathing the harmonies arranged by both vocalists are undeniably catching and well written and the music follows closely in suit leaving your head bobbing back and forth to the beat and your feet tapping almost involuntarily the forecast is not only a great recorded band but bring the same toe tapping energy to the stage with both great stage presence and cohesion as a band the forecast will defiantly be one of the new big bands in poppier rock music and checking their victory records debut out is a must for fans of the genre
1,this is a charming little book it s very concise profusely illustrated and it covers the basic geometry of platonic and archimedean solids it delightfully summarizes the work of plato theaetetus archimedes euclid kepler and euler in only pages half of which contain only illustrations as a model builder who attaches no special religious significance to polyhedra i was a little concerned when i looked at the other books in the series that this book might be about sacred geometry fortunately at least from my point of view it does not contain a word about it except for a cursory reference to the elements plato associated with each of the platonic solids a table at the end includes the dihedral and central angles and edge radius ratios for all the platonic and archimedean solids all the info a model builder needs this book won t impress anyone with a mathematics background but for a layman like me it s a perfect introduction kudos to sutton for putting this material in such an elegant and accessible format
1,after i read the reviews on this toy i wanted to cancel my order thankfully i didn t because my kids love it i have two boys and they love bowling with this toy my kids have played with it since we got it in feburary in the reviews people said the toy broke soon after playing with it my kids play with it all the time and we have not had any problems everything still works great the pins the sound and the ball return
0,the external antenna is a plastic decoration only and does not do anything functional false advertising
0,when we bought this i liked the versatility it offered i quickly noticed however that it is mostly good for strewing the soft pieces everywhere there are actually too many pieces to keep up with and frankly i m getting sick of stepping on the cow my mos old likes it for a couple minutes until he s rolled away from it my year old thinks it s interesting but she just ends up taking it apart and the pieces end up all over the place after a couple days of playing with it i usually put most of it away and keep out only a couple parts to complement our other toys the water play mat lasted until my year old stepped on it once or twice then that was gone
1,great movie delivery of the order came in good time this disc collector s edition comes with some interesting extras i found the offtakes blubbers to be in bad taste but the rest of the extras were worth seeing personnally i would avoid watching the extras that describe the making of the movie although it is interesting to watch especially for those wanting to go into the movie making business i find that it then takes away from the enjoyment of watching the movie itself just my personal preference no doubt others will have different opinions
0,i bought this set for my daughter the bedding is such a poor quality that my daughter won t sleep in her bed she says the sheets are itchy the comforter is so hard it is like a big piece of cardboard i would not recomend this set to anyone
1,this is a good battery and lasts for a long time good value
1,i was a little surprised at the size and weight of this watch its almost thick and the bezel is a full across so the case is a bit bigger than that the mineral glass crystal seems substantial and durable but the clarity is just average in addition to having glow in the dark markings which don t work too well on the hands and dial markers it also has an indiglo style back light which does work well the bezel only rotates counter clockwise and it seems very tight at first overall it s a decent everyday watch
0,i have a with a cell number that has been with me for over years perhaps blinded by this incredibly good price i thought my fulfilled contract i am on month to month now meant i could qualify for a new account and keep my number no such luck after wasting a few hours dealing with cingular and then someone in india on behalf of wirefly i had to return it it is ironic that someone who has never had a cell phone can get a price lower than a loyal year customer i will take the next carrier that offers a reasonable price on a even though i would prefer the
1,to begin with i wish these so called reviewers would stop giving away the plots of the movies they extol that said this is a rare case the of its kind of a movie being better than the play it was based on the general framework was of course the same but in the play judy holliday s part was taken by josephine hull a very funny little old lady who also scored both on bway and on the screen in harvey and arsenic and old lace to name the only that i know of and the love interest on stage was only hinted at around the edges it blossomed in the film one problem there simply were no witty lines either in the play or the movie this is odd for kaufman though the play was produced in very late in his career but about par for burrows early in his career but still it was clever and interesting the play had more structure than the movie typical of kaufman but the movie did things with the plot that were suggested but left undone in the play which surprised me very much and made me wonder about kaufman also the flick left out all the naughty words which i m sure hull barked out with delicious abandon note kaufman co wrote the play burrows adapted it for the screen this i think was more a sit com than an actually witty kaufman comedy and finally judy holliday did not play a dumb blonde she only did that in born yesterday
1,i have been studing leadership for over years both by reading and experience i consider this book to be the best book i have read because it describes leadership as a learned activity it also says that leadership is in motivating people to do their own work in solving difficult problems i found that as president of my congregation i was continually going back to the concepts in the book to lead it through a very difficult situation involving placement of the flags in the sanctuary it was very difficult to get people to do their own work and not try to step in to solve everything that would have been impossible anyway i found that he described president lyndon johnson as a successful leader civil rights and unsuccessful leader vietnam his discussion on leading without authority is new ground for me if you want to discuss the book with others there is an on line book study at the work and worship institute website i found it was a good way for me to get more from the book this is a great book with great stories of a variety of leaders in our society
0,i have used turbo tax for the past years so this year like a drone i purchased it at amazon great price by the way well i receive the product and try to load it and find out as of july it isn t compatible with windows now i have to send it to turbo tax for a refund its great that they are doing that but they should have put something on the front of the box after a minute call to turbo tax they finally agreed to credit me the difference of for the purchase of their online software the online software was the same exact program i purchased from amazon but they charge more go figure it sounds fishy and deceitful to me i will never buy their software again
0,i had the clever idea to compare this version with the new movie what a mistake the original pink panther is an absolute bore there is really no story essentially peter sellers spends much of the movie trying to get his wife in bed major parts of the story make no sense don t waste your time
0,this item was fine when it came to pictures tattoos were not visible on film for the first part of our wedding however i was told by a few of the guests that it looked like i had been in a fight before the wedding make up should not look like bruises the make up also started to fade not long after the ceremony ended and it was a short ceremony by the end of the reception four hours later you could clearly see the tattoos also i was told that the make up would not rub off onto clothing if i used the special setting powder together with the cream not true i now have make up stains on one of my brides maids dresses i realize now that i should have just let the tattoos show why have a tattoo if you re not willing to show it off
1,i could not remember the name source of our previous petit fours so i ordered them from wisconsin cheeseman because i had never had a problem with previous orders from this company the order was delivered on time these petit fours were more moist and flavorful than those from our previous source everyone who received them as gifts commented on them

1,i have been using the family tree maker products for a number of years i love its ease in the ability to add new people into the genealogy charts i am a little disappointed in the change that moved the screen away from looking like a tabbed folder i feel that the old style was a lot more user friendly both visually and functionally
1,i am years old and started out in photography as a kid with a contact printer and a box camera i have had all types of cameras over the years mostly film canon slr s i too bought all sorts of these mp point and shoot digital cameras before returning to my true love slr s i have had my digital canon rebel xt about a month now and i can t keep my hands off of it it lacks nothing although the kit lense is good i bought a canon zoom lense with image stabilizion and have produced stunning photo s with it i love the way you can use the points to focus i mainly use only the center point with focus lock and never get an out of focus picture i guess the nicest thing for me is that i now don t have the urge to buy every point and shoot camera that is paraded out on qvc or hsn that has a wonderful new feature like low light or non shake this canon has every good feature in the known universe and you can t outgrow it its a camera that will let you be as good as you can be it won t hold you back the battery life is great the built in flash is good but i bought a and that s even better i never figure i m wasting money buying accessories for this camera as it will be my main squeeze for many years to come i always missed my canon slr s and now feel that i have an old friend back again only much much better believe me you can t go wrong getting this camera its beyond description

0,m night shyamalan s the sixth sense is a noteworthy example of how the technique of misdirection can be employed in cinema however the mere use of misdirection does not guarantee that a film will wind up being any good psychologist malcolm crowe bruce willis returns home one evening after receiving an award for his work with children a former patient awaits him there and shoots him in front of his wife time passes and crowe tries to put the incident behind him by immersing himself in a new case crowe takes on a new patient named cole sear haley joel osment who claims that he is able to see dead people around him the sixth sense created a sensation upon its release as filmgoers relished its twist ending yet if the truth be told the ending will not come as a surprise to fantasy and science fiction fans or to those who are actually paying attention to the events unfolding onscreen rather than sitting back and just going along for the ride the entire success of the sixth sense hinges on whether you are able to figure out the ending ahead of time and unfortunately shyamalan s use of misdirection just does not mask the final revelation effectively enough from the beginning of the film one knows that something is amiss and the twist becomes more and more obvious as the story continues to unfold the acting is first rate with willis osment toni collette and olivia williams turning in great work willis in particular turns in an interesting performance that is a departure from his more action oriented roles however even with all the quality acting on display you just cannot shake the feeling that the the sixth sense is essentially just a drawn out twilight zone episode when all is said and done
1,i d be stating the obvious and preaching to the choir if i said that care of lenses for slr cameras required a decent lens cap this one snaps into threads on the end of many lenses canon and otherwise so just be sure to confirm that that it s the proper size for your lens
0,i have subscribed to discover magazine for years but have recently cancelled my subscription the magazine which once served up well written news of present and future science has become a hack rag from juvenile sexual humor and associated photos couched under the guise of science to supposed factual articles that seem ripped from my local papers op ed page the whole magazine has degraded into a worthless pile of trash

1,this gel based mascara does an excellent job of creating long separate and well defined but natural lashes if you like your mascara to have some oomph to it you would want to look elsewhere for those who can t stand a single clump you may have found your new favorite if you ve ever gotten a mascara in a slender green tube in a clinique gift with purchase this is the one the one you buy is in a slender and slightly larger silver tube you can brush on coat after coat of this gel like wonder and not get a single clump wow this mascara is fiber free and has been opththalmologist approved for contact lens wearers the jet black is a true black and the jet brown is noticeably brown on the wand but looks great on the lashes as with all long wearing eye makeup products such as mascara this one needs to be removed with an eye makeup remover
1,this album is essentially a fusion of great musical minds the legendary khan payes more attention to making this a better experience for the western audiences of the sufi music by playing more with his brilliant vocal skills then with the lyrics micheal brooks music stands out and enhances the experience further this is not to say that the mainstream indo paki audience won t enjoy this album this is one of my all time favs it is fabulous background listening while doing work which may need focus for those who need music to do such things for those who have been thinking of testing out sufi music this is the place to start this is a fine introduction to the great nfak and sufi music

1,rings ding s are the best snacks out there for many a reasons first off they are the best after dinner snacks out there it s really like a cake just more condensed and not as fatty or filling also these things are addicting in my life i cannot even count how much packs i have consumed since i have been eating these things everyday since i was young and let s just say now i am very old if you cannot afford drugs then go for the ring ding s the only negative about these things if there isn t enough cream then you get a mouthful of chocolate most people i know like the chocolate but i personally would not like a mouthful of it another bad thing is in the summer they are melted and can only be slightly revived if refrigerated they kind of lose that good flavor edge in the summer which makes this the perfect snack for the winter alright the anatomy of a ring ding dun dun dun first off you get a chocolatey outside that is pretty soft in the center is a creamy sensation sorry if that sounded dirty get your mind out of the gutter that really makes this product go from good to great put that together and you get probably the best snack out there right now they come two in a pack and are made by drake s usually drake s is in the shadow of hostess yet i feel drake s destroys hostess in terms of their cakes if you are actually reading this please don t destroy me for saying that ring ding s totally annihilates anything hostess has ever put out wow i managed to make a food product two paragraphs long two short paragraphs i should say i would put the whole history of the ring ding in but that would probably be taking someone else s work i guess i ll stop now anyway ring ding s for the win

0,i paid for this aesthetically pleasing scale sure it looks nice but if it doesn t do its job it s not much of an accessory for the bathroom it took me a while to figure out how the scale works there are a lot of beeps involved essentially to program your info you start by pressing the mode button adjust your height press mode adjust your age press mode select your gender press mode select between normal and athlete press mode and you will hear a beep to confirm then to store press either the up button for memory s and or the down button for s and press mode and there will be another beep to confirm still with me if you just want your weight you just step on the scale but if you want to get your body fat and water you must press the up or down button to find your memory then press mode and wait for the beep before you step on the scale now i don t know about you but this procedure is a lot more cumbersome than any other scale i owned so fine i ve now figured out how to work the thing getting even somewhat accurate results are another thing when i stepped on the scale i would sometimes be surprised by the weight i didn t think i could gain pounds in one day i eat very healthy and my weight range is usually between pounds but if you step on the scale again like some other digital scales it seems to remember your last weight and won t give you your real weight so i have to put some other object on it to get a reading and then the scale resets i step on the scale again and my weight is now pounds less than the original reading the body water didn t fluctuate too much and the body fat was higher than the reading on the last scale i owned conair thinner brand all in all i am returning this scale and going back to the drawing board in finding something that is even the least bit accurate

0,i am not impressed with tiffen filters i got in this set the finish of the rings are poor despite of previously poor reputaion i recently purchased some quantaray filter from the local ritz camera store which are of much better quality compared to this set of tiffen filters i never got tiffens before had good experience with hoyas i will probably stay with those from now on now come to think of it ritz camera indicated the quantaray they had were made by hoya the glass on all the filters are quite a bit more reflective compared to the hoyas and the quantarays not a good sign the circular polarizer had some smudges and some lense swirl that after sheets of lense tissue and quite a bit of cleaning solution failed to be fully cleared off quite frustrating all of the filters came with lint and a few little smudges on them not sure if the store handling or the manufacturer handling was to blame but none of the other filters i got before had this kind of problem right out of the box the set might be cheap but it sure is for a good reason

0,being a starsky and hutch fan since i was a kid i was looking forward to playing this the graphics are cartoon horrible and the need for vr points becomes annoying after awhile the bad guys are like something from a chinese kung fu movie you can shoot at them accurately and it takes all day to kill them and that s with playing with a gun i can t imagine shooting with a controller which makes you lose the mission because you are down on vr points the dialog gets annoying too and you can t skip hearing it either
1,i have thick coarse african american hair that is relaxed permed straight i usually use this product on wet hair after a shampoo when blow drying my hair straight it makes it really smooth and shiny i have received a lot of compliments on my hair since i have started using it in warm temperatures it does melt down but in my opinion it makes it easier to use when it is a solid you are supposed to rub it in the palm of your hands to liquify it and then put it in your hair it does have a smokey scent to it but no one pays attention to that they are looking at how great my hair is i love ojon s conditioner it is the very best i have ever used but the shampoo in my opinion seems to dry my hair

0,i use the extension cable that came with the adapter to extend the gps device further down the dashboard this adapter apparently can t sustain the weight of its own extension cable leaning against the clear plastic cradle i ve only used it twice first time it snapped off the back half of the cradle and the second time finished off the front half the connector sticking out of the adapter still works with the cable but i m going to try and super glue the cradle back together before using it again i don t want the connector to snap off next
1,this lounge chair i bought two exceeded my expectations for quality i ve been shopping retail stores for months and can tell you that you can t beat this deal they are very sturdy and attractive don t be in a big hurry as they would have arrived quicker on the back of a snail you can t do better than free shipping but remember that you get what you pay for i made seperate appts with shipping company to deliver these items first there was a miscommunication second they had no record of the appt third they finally arrived but after their promised delivery time aside from the delivery frustrations i am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend these for your backyard they look great on our pool deck
1,this book still does not address many areas i find interesting in james brown s career but i find it a natural companion to the three other jb books in my collection cynthia rose s living in america the soul saga of james brown geoff brown s biography james brown and ofcourse the brown tucker the godfather of soul james brown all three dig deep into this metaphysical musician s mind but this one has a stronger narrative a bit less guarded his late fall is described in a more contrite way for example his scientific study of his audience is perhaps something new in his dialogue but he broaches the subject of how music motivates women in a different way than it does men then immediately moves on to the next thought even by standards his live albums contain some of the most overt sexuality obviously directed at the female fans ever recorded similarly his admonitions to admonishes contemporary rap hip hop artists are eloquent but must be deemed a bit self righteous there is alot of adult content in his catalogue which can t be explained away as art however fans can trace his development into more cerebral music with more and more sensitive ballads and socially conscious tunes being produced from the late on i was happy to read his description of little richard s assistance in his early career but a bit disheartened when he suggested that penniman was basically a rock and roll raver i find it hard to believe that this publication brought out his true feelings about his georgia neighbor the influence is quite obvious and not just on chonnie on chon another depressing ommission is with marva whitney his popular lead female vocalist from c to a recent documentary reveals that marva traveled to vietnam with the star but here he simply says that he was only allowed to travel with a small part of his musical backup despite the above concerns with this book james brown has shown the literary world that he is a writer ofcourse this was obvious to the musical world just listen to don t be a drop out i don t want nobody to give me nothing the man in the glass i m not demanding it s christmas time and peace in the world

1,i am very pleased with my moleskin small address book i can fully appreciate why picasso and hemingway used the moleskin notebooks the quality of material used to produced my address book is clearly of the highest that can be found what i especially liked about my small moleskin address book is that the pages are ruled for you to use as you like unlike other books that have designated space for street addresses or phone number as you know sometimes all you want to do it keep the phone number while with other contacts you want to keep a biography on them their birthdates their children s birthdates anniversary email addresses etc i think its a perfect address book i liked it so much i bought three one for my mom my sister and myself

1,first published in this is the poirot book the superintendent battle book and the colonel race book and has no narrator it s the first case in which superintendent battle mrs oliver or col race appear together with poirot or each other and the only case in which all do so at once the story opens at an exhibition of snuffboxes where poirot encounters mr shaitana a collector with a catty manner and a knack for gossip shaitana deliberately cultivates a mephistopholean pose which at first makes him seem like the potential quarry in the case but it becomes clear that he s a victim waiting to happen for shaitana like a few other collectors in christie s universe has succumbed to a foolish temptation and begun collecting people and not just people of talent or genius but murderers and being a connoisseur he collects only the best those who have gotten away with it he amuses himself on this occasion by boasting to poirot of his hobby without naming names and inviting him to a little supper party to meet his collection of tigers poirot having just pointed out that he himself could admire a tiger but would do so from outside the tiger s cage having respect for the danger poirot accepts the supper invitation however to find that there are seven other guests including the three other detectives as well as four guests who are presumably the murderers explorer major despard a strong silent type mrs lorrimer a middle aged widow who is very serious about bridge timid young anne meredith and dr roberts a loud and jovial general practitioner shaitana drops hints referring to four possible methods of murder but otherwise the subject does not come up and the guests proceed to play bridge after supper arising from the final game to find their host dead stabbed sitting beside the fire in full view of the players this is of course poirot s fantasy case as he once remarked in the abc murders because there is no tangible evidence against any one person more than another there are only the people themselves and their memories of the evening and the bridge scores reflecting how the evening progressed solving the case depends entirely on being able to understand the people involved but how to get them to reveal their true selves to an interrogator or to uncover the crimes that shaitana believed they d committed and gotten away with rather than following poirot s viewpoint in third person throughout some chapters follow battle race or mrs oliver as they conduct their own enquiries into the case each represents a different style battle is a professional police officer race an empire builder type secret agent and mrs oliver a writer of detective stories battle of course has a duty to investigate shaitana s murder and does so in an orthodox style cultivating an image of plodding hard work that tempts one to underestimate him race deals with checking out major despard the explorer who s most clearly his kind of person mrs oliver for her part works on worming information out of not only anne meredith but her roommate rhonda whose attitude is that anne could ve lived like a duchess for the rest of her life on blackmail if she d been paying attention and of course there s poirot he s really fascinating to watch in this one as he interacts with each suspect in turn pursuing two major lines of questioning describe how the bridge games played out and describe the scene of the murder the elaborate collector s room in shaitana s house where the bridge games were played see if you can figure out where poirot s questions lead before he reveals his reasoning to his colleagues and what he learned from the responses he received
1,after reading the reviews i was hesitant however i ve gotten a perfect cup every time so far with my senseo the coffee is very good but it has fallen a little short of my expectations i ve previously brought kona back from my hawaiian vacations and ground it myself the pod coffee is not quite as good as fresh ground update for my next shipment this two cup style was backordered aloha island coffee co sent me the equivalent amount of coffee in single cup style pods instead i ve found these pods to work better fit the senseo machine better and this coffee now does tasted just as good or better than fresh ground whole bean kona i think the single pod style is quite a bit more expensive than two cup style but the difference is definitely noticeable
1,i bought this deck about months ago it has performed flawless in every aspect as soon as i turned it on i could notice a big difference in the sound quality from my old poineer deck i have taken all of my cd s out of my truck because there is no need for the cd player if you take advantage of the ipod interface the ipod function is flawless and easy to use just plug in your ipod and search by artist album song title or playlist this can get a little tricky while driving ecpecially if you have a large library so i would suggest using playlists the output of sound quality from an ipod is amazing also there is a very useful bass engine that is very useful if you have subs this function allows for flawless bass output and easy ajustment this deck is the best overall i have ever listened to

0,interesting story line but shallow and goes nowhere kubrick style drawn out and paced shots are unimaginative poorly composed and add little or nothing to the experience looks like the ending is just a contrivance to exit a lost story line i ve lived in rural japan and it s the most boring place on earth perhaps the intent here but hardly something you d pay money to suffer thru or for masochists only you dont think the younger generations flee to the cities for no reason at all

1,i should first confess my bias i have often been tickled and sometimes awed by mortimer s way with english prose for years so in picking up this book i had the high expectations one might have before meeting an old friend or beloved teacher no disappointment even if some of these essays are slightly less effervescent than others all are at least wonderful and several are both brilliant and touching mortimer has given us a collection of short essays conversational and often wryly funny which he intends as a kind of spiritual bequeathal to his family and other heirs the chapters range across a broad range of subjects some perhaps outwardly frivolous like the cooking of eggs but in the main mortimer touches on matters of great substance the nature of beauty how to be happy surprising ways in which our world has managed to be unjust places and times for sex how to dine sociably the love of children faith and reason the terrors of the writer facing blank paper and many more i found these essays to be wise and absolutely delicious i suspect that readers who have enjoyed rumpole or mortimer s other biographical essays like summer of a doormouse or clinging to the wreckage will be quite pleased with these sketches mortimer may sadly be nearing the end of his life but at present he seems to be on a literary tear i for one wish him many more prolific years
0,i was so excited about how great this product worked when i got it i had purchased the fm transmitter for my wife and they do not work so great so i thought since my car had a tape deck i would give this a try i was excited that i had all my ipod music with me but after less than a week it the sound started going down hill to a point where i couldn t listen anymore with it it is now in a landfill somewhere my guess is i will need a radio in the car that is ipod compatiable cable for now just have the radio and cds i burn

1,after being into the techno scene since my first party in this is one of the best videos i have seen describing the dj feelings you really get a feel for how a dj thinks if you at all interested in the dj lifestyle or are interested in djing this is a must have it have great insights in the minds of some of the best djs around plus nigel richards does a great job with the how to dj part not only is this for the newbies but for those who have been around a bit plus he makes learning fun with his comments and body mannerisms wow that sounded like an infomercial

1,what a great movie and it s still believable after all these years even with the mainframe computer consoles and tape reels and camera monitors the panscan is very well executed and hardly noticeable or annoying the print that was used has stood up very well this is the movie that got me interested in programming computers when i first saw it before there even was a microsoft i had dreams of one day building my very own super computer under a mountain somewhere the damn things can now fall deep inside your ear canal and lodge inside your brain if you re not careful i wish the movie had more story to it instead of just being a rather quick build up to an even quicker ending but this is a movie i can watch over again and again wow this isn t just any movie about a mainframe and its keypunch operator this one s the real mccoy

1,if i had to choose a fragrance that was the most feminine i ve ever smelled it would be marc jacobs yes it s a gardenia based scent but definitely not your typical musty heavy gardenia by any means marc jacobs is different in that it is a wet gardenia like you re smelling a bunch of gardenias that have been swirling around in a bowl of fresh water intoxicatingly alluring the notes of this fragrance are gardenia wild muguet skin musk cedar ginger the gardenia in this is faint but lovely it isn t a knock you out strong gardenia but very mellow and mesmerizing it ll follow you like a breath of fresh air and you ll have people sniffing the air you leave behind if you ve ever smelled michael by michael kors this is different michael is not gardenia but it is a tuberose scent it is very strong creamy heavy and thick if you like michael you may like marc jacobs as your spring summer alternative they re in the same family in terms of florals and such but different in terms of how they wear marc jacobs being flowy and michael being heavy the oz retails at and the oz at it s quite expensive but it does have that brand name smacked on the front i think it s worth it the lasting power is decent even when you may feel it is gone it s not and people will compliment you try it out and see how you like it on your skin

1,i was happy enough with the function of office xp and held off upgrading for a long time what pushed me over was when i switched to using outlook as my email client accessing quite a few email accounts for various websites getting a spam filter to work smoothly under that circumstance was nasty i spent many hours in addition to the fees for programs that were clunky and could never be kept working well office s outlook comes with it s own spam filter it works it s simple and it s unobtrusive the other programs have a nicer look and a few bells and whistles but the upgrades i appreciate most are in outlook

1,needed it s just as informative as macworld but more fun too read to me macworld is like reading a text book while mac addict is like learning the same information from a really funny professor i especially like the do it yourself projects that macaddict walks you through each month they range in difficulty from how to build your own mac os x icons to how to program your own video game in visual basic to how to void your warrantee by soldering crazy stuff to the motherboard these guys are seasoned mac geeks and they aren t afraid to help you become one too if you re a super sensitive person macaddict may rub you the wrong way sometimes their editors make jokes that draw hate mail from the readers like when the polish editor in chief cracks polish jokes i don t mind these silly things but some might to me all of the jokes usually help their articles make a more concrete and lucid point throughout the year macaddict has special issues devoted to topics like maintenance practical jokes digital media preventing disasters detailed os x guides etc i find these invaluable i m the guy my friends ask for mac help not because i m smarter than other people but because i ve been reading this great magazine for year
0,my nephew was very excited when he saw the box and the picture unfortunately the inflatable suit is not really inflatable it requires constant air to keep it poofy looking it is basically a costume that has elastic bands around the neck and wrists and requires a blower battery operated to blow airs in to keep it looking inflated the battery is heavy and will not stay put on the two inch diameter hole on the back side of the thin vinyl suit everytime he moves it pops out the fan is noisy so he ran around in the clingy deflated suit for a few minutes and begged to be let out of it as the elastic bands were restricting him he loves superman and loves having a cape he opted for a regular white towel over the thin red vinyl cape the costume came with i suppose we got what we paid for cheap prices doesn t equate to quality i felt like my nephew got only a couple of minutes out of this toy would not recommend it to anyone else unfortunately

0,this step stool is a safety hazard the sides are not angled enough so a two year old can easily step too close to the edge and tip it over in fact the stepping surface is so small that it s hard for a little guy to stay in the middle of it and when the stool is tumbled over a little explorer can hurt himself badly when he falls onto the sharp edges of the legs

0,i love the style fabric fit extremely comfortable but it is a t shirt i m and it doesn t come past my hips
0,this product falls into the category of not worth the cost of shipping for me the bag is a basic black nylon bag that is adequate for holding a large yoga mat the bag was shipped in an envelope via usps first class mail for samfe was the retailer that amazon used for this transaction so free super saver shipping was not available samfe charged for shipping i generally stay away from retailers who charge shipping in order to boost their profits hence the low star rating for an otherwise adequate product
0,there s a reason this thing is only bucks it s absolute junk i put it into the cassette player in my car and the sounds were completely distorted the voice constantly skips and the casette sometimes clicks the quality of sound in my car is usually amazing and basically there was no bass sound coming through my speakers using this device i ve tried both sides but still no avail i plan on returning it if shipping doesn t cost more than the product itself
0,prior to buying this phone i had heard a lot of people say that motorola s hardware was very good but that their software left a lot to be desired nonetheless i decided to try this phone out when it came time to start a new cell plan i had made the decision to switch to t mobile and this looked like one of the best phone options right off the bat i found out that the people who criticized moto s software were right on the money there are a host of poorly designed software aspects of this phone not the least of which is the frankly idiotic way the phone book is designed eventually i made peace with all of the things i disliked about the since at least it seemed to work well enough as a phone as time went by i started noticing that i was missing a lot of calls the phone would be in my bag or in my pocket or sitting on my desk when suddenly it would ring with the voicemail notification from a message that i had received anywhere from minutes to hours before during the course of the last few months the phone is less than a year old i ve also found that it has begun crashing a lot opening or closing it will result in a white screen of death putting it on the charger will cause it to switch back and forth between the messages that it is charging that it is unable to charge and that it s sim card cannot be found after a few minutes of which it will simply shut itself off with a full battery charge it will continually shut itself off at this point i am forced to conclude that this phone is an absolute piece of junk i am also forced to conclude that it isn t the only model which is none of my coworkers has ever had a good experience with a motorola phone my wife s motorola has shown its own host of problems people working for t mobile at several stores i have visited have confided that they never ever recommend motorola phones to anyone in fact i ve had t mobile employees urge me to not buy any phones from them but rather to shop for an unlocked nokia online so that s what i m going to do until i can buy a new phone all i can do is recharge this phone every night restart it five or six times a day and keep apologizing to my friends family and employers for always missing their calls
1,i really enjoy playing with this harp whenever i get a chance to because it produces a very good sound without having to blow or suck a lot of air in i found it very easy to bend notes in fact this is the first harp in which i was able to bend notes on the roundedout edges are also very nice on the hands and it makes it easier to hold it is made of plastic and not wood but that hasn t caused a problem so far so i would reccomend a hohner golden melody in any key to anyone although i would choose the one in the key of c if you re a begginer because it would be easier to learn on i think
1,i shopped online for probably two months before finally settling on these headphones i wanted nice headphones to compliment my ipod yet at an affordable price the akg k is the perfect solution after looking at other models by akg and other brands like sennheiser and bose i thought i would have to spend at least in order to get quality but then i found these and i snatched them up the sound is excellent when i first plugged them in i thought they were a little quiet but then i discovered that there is a lanyard style volume switch on the headphones themselves which is fantastic i don t have to reach into my pocket to turn the volume up or down on my ipod the sound is very crisp and articulate with deep accentuating bass and because these headphones are designed for portable players my ipod is powerful enough to really push the drivers of the headphones the soft ear pads offer great comfort for long listening and sound dampening they block out a lot of ambient noise but the headband takes some getting used to as it is a little bit tight once you adjust to it though you can wear them for hours the last thing i will mention is the style these headphones look great and the colors compliment the white ipod really well they also fold up to an incredibly compact size and they even come with a travel pouch now that is convenient if you are looking for great headphones for your portable player i truly say look no further i did so much research before settling on these that i feel like i became an expert in the audio field the akg k offers amazing sound great comfort compact size and best of all affordability
1,we were concerned about using a regular crib bumper for our tall toddler but we needed something to keep his pacifiers in his crib at night this crib bumper does the job when he stands on it it collapses so it s no help boosting him over the side my one gripe which i m not sure there s a way around is that there s a gap between the front crib corners and the bumper that attaches to the front rail the one that slides up and down because our little one is older we put stuffed animals in the corners but i m not sure how comfortable i d be using the bumper with an infant who might get her legs or arms caught

0,this is without a doubt the worste game i have ever purchased it is basiclly one big empty landscape with about or so bosses that you have to climb on to beat they could have made this a decent game so easily just by puting in some minions and some characters to talk to and buy stuff from as it is right now it s just a really really really crappy version of zelda orcarina of time if you have any respect for decent video games you will not buy this video game unless it is for the sole purpose of setting it on fire and stomping on it
1,this is a sleek sharp quality watch and the lowest priced model that i ve seen in the arctura series if you can catch it on sale i think its a great buy however be prepared for the weight this is the heaviest watch i ve ever worn and probably the largest if you re used to wearing stainless watches it will probably be fine for you i m used to leather bands and the weight difference is quite noticeable wish i could find this watch in titanium that would be perfect overall if you re not bothered by the large size or weight it looks great and i m sure the quality is also
0,season of veronica mars took me by surprise and i really enjoyed the ride the second season however doesn t live up to the quality of the first instead of one large mystery in season two viewers are treated to several smaller mysteries to solve there s nothing wrong with that approach but it seemed that as fast as one mystery skien got solved another would pop right up without any resolution for the first many episodes ended with my friends and i turning to one another and asking is that it where s the rest of it this happened quite a bunch with the child abuse investigation episode as perhaps the most jarring are we really supposed to believe someone as determined as veronica would just pick up and call it quits because she gets a weird slap on the wrist that s totally out of character yet we never see that family the abused girl or hear about the incident again that type of confusion and weird plot points kept popping up the major villain of the season comes out of left field to be the murderer and his motivation for murder ends up being really weak and unbelievable because of the all the loose ends go nowhere plots and the surprise villain who was probably a surprise to the writers up until deadline i m giving season a star rating season of veronica mars still has some funny dialogue and some clever episodes but it doesn t deserve all the and star reviews i ve seen i ll continue to watch however as veronica mars has a lot of promise hopefully the producers can get things in gear for season
1,i came in a timely manner and was exactly what i expected the person that received it loved it
1,excellent little known movie with viggo mortensen as an f b i agent under deep cover to infiltrate japenese mob great performances by all michael nouri a little over the top great action and sentimentality when viggos character is torn between man who treats him like a son and duty as an agent after f b i makes deal with mobster nouri to make a hit on the yakuza
0,my wife and i both got this phone at the same time i chose it because it claims to be rugged and the price was right well we have had them for around six months and they are both not working right my wife took hers to one of those stores in the mall that can change the case so her now wears pink shortly after it started resetting itself randomly she would pick it up just to find that she needed to enter the sim password over time it started doing it more and more at first i believed that it might be due to damage done from the case change but later my phone started doing the same thing now my phone will reset itself at least four or five times a day i absolutely cannot believe that such a product is even being sold with such a bad defect anybody can ship one bad product but to get two phones with the same problem is unforgivable shame on motorola

0,the forgotten starring julianne moore and domnic west is a slow tepid and hard to grasp film the previews for this film were better than the actual movie i guess that s a bad sign that the movie isn t going to be great i ll try and remember that next time the only reason i am giving the fogotten stars is the scene with alfe woodward you ll know what i mean when it happens the scence is scary and comes out of nowhere very intrguing spurprise awaits anyways the forgotten is a movie you should see once and that s it happy viewing

1,i have bought two of these units one for seattle and one for a condo in southern california and they ve both worked well the seattle unit is constantly wet like the city and its residents and the palm springs unit has no problem with temperatures well above degrees at times neither one has failed yet it is a pain to change the batteries you ll need the world s smallest screwdriver to remove the screws that allow you to get inside the unit to change the batteries and the cheap metal bracket that allows the remote unit to stand up outside you ll lose that within a week
1,excellent product really protects you my dermatologist recommended this product and although it s more expensive it s worth the protection for your skin i m glad my children are using it
1,the mother is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality a woman who isn t ready to stay home watch the telly and vegetates after her husband of nearly three decades and a controlling dominating chap at that packs it in with a massive heart attack may anne reid is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect indeed demand a future of happiness but she is also inescapably vulnerable she s fishing in uncharted emotional waters who controls her relationship with darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand much less resolve in her sixties she s still a work in progress something s gotta give showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited after all it s jack nicholson and the always beautiful diane keaton cavorting in the world of the rich and to insure that no serious psycho social issues were explored keaton s young girlfriend amanda peet daughter of keaton not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old er would be lover never hopped into the sack not on this film people probably gasped when may writhed passionately in bed with her younger hunk lover darren daniel craig or later saw sexually explicit drawings by may when this first came out on theaters i doubt the audience was aghast at the nudity or the drawings content as much as feeling uneasy at seeing a woman in her rapturously enjoying sex it s to be inspected that anne reid s inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others i truly ejoyed this film last night and will never forget it kudos to director roger michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy
0,looks great but not worth the money my son begged for this toy and it was a big dud almost impossible to fly i think once out of tries were we successful made out of flimsy material it chipped and scraped right away do not buy this toy
1,i have tried other systems before and they took the long way around about getting to the rock and roll stuff i wanted this one however jumps straight into what i wanted to know about rock guitar the teaching method is fantastic the program shows not only where notes would fall but includes a virtual fret board so i can see exactly what to play this feature includes a slow version to start with then a normal speed version that in almost every case is exactly like the song being heard i have played guitar that is fooled with guitar for about twenty years this program got me playing and learning every day for a couple hours now i have much more fun jamming and playing songs i have heard i recommend this for anyone beginners to intermediate

0,anna netrebko s i puritani selections are way below the art and skill of callas sills sutherland caballe and gencer she has no passion no trills no high notes that are deep and rich her best is in the russian repertoire and possibley some undemanding mozart her broadcast from the met live of the i puritani was alright but scooping avoidance of repetitions running through passages like a locomotive and an ending that would have brought the wrath of most opera houses in the world scooping again and a tight awful sounding high note the same tentativenes is also here on this cd she should know this her beauty and acting and allure are what interest the masses not the voice which is forgiven everything too bad she could be a lovely tatyana some day also too the traviata is not that great anna moffo renee fleming m caballe and of course maria callas listen to these and hear the difference

1,we purchased this monitor based on other great reviews i would have to say that it does work well the only issue we had was that it only worked on one channel for it to have clear reception from my daughters room to our master bedroom also on that channel if it was on and the cordless phone rang it had a large amount of static and you would have to turn off the monitor it has given me peace of mind that i don t have to run in every sound she makes i can look in on the monitor and see if she really does need me i would recommend this product
0,i work for a software company so i know a little about the user interface concept this is one of the worst packages i have ever used i just spent an hour trying to draw my house and get the dimensions right the automatic dimension builder did not work i had to draw it and redraw it to get the dimensions right then i added a few windows and doors and porches then i tried to use the camera to get a vertical view the whole file blew up can t find it anywhere the manual is useless and the tutorial cd is just an overview of each topic what a waste of moeny
0,after being greeted with much excitement this program wouldn t properly install on my not so fussy computer the web assistance was of little help at all and we had to send it back very disappointing
1,heh i m joking everybody has a right to an opinion turns out this film has held up well i d seen it in the and have always wanted to give it another go the material involving a young naturalist leaving his family and big city life behind to live in the canadian countryside is most appealing to me i imagine it wouldn t be the most desirable plan to kids of today but you never know i ll admit the young actor his bares a striking resembance to the home alone actor but not so much as the cover suggests i mean he doesn t exactly make friends with the bear either just an attempt to sell it to kids anyway i thoroughly enjoyed seeing this film again and was quite happy with the image quality well done paramount
1,great salt scrub and it really does get warm on contact and leaves skin baby sooofft
0,i love peterson s guides but the birds of mexico is severely lacking the art certainly holds up to the standard set by the guides to north america but unfortunately it can only be considered complete if you tag along two other peterson guides perhaps a good addition if you wish to complete your collection of peterson guides but otherwise buy howell s or edward s guides both of which far outshine this guide when considered alone howell s is certainly the most complete but edward s guide is a bit handier in the field
1,about two years ago i became a subscriber to shape mainly because i had received it for free as part of a package deal with another magazine i had always liked browsing through issues of shape in the supermarket and i thought that being a subscriber would help support my fitness goals overall i have enjoyed shape and found it to be useful but there definitely are some negatives and the magazine might not be for everyone but first the good like many others have mentioned what i most enjoy about shape is their real life weight stories featuring a nice variety of women some of whom actually needed to gain weight in order to be healthy i also love their relatively new feature in which they follow one of their own staffers on a year long weight loss journey many of their other regular features are also excellent particularly the body part focused strength exercises and other how to exercise guides and i especially like that shape uses reader models with so many of their articles real life women of various ages although admittedly mostly in the range with normal healthy strong bodies finally their featured exercise plans each month often offer some unique variations on traditional exercises and the recipes are often quite good as well the main negative has already been brought up by many others here the use of too skinny not overtly fit or strong models to illustrate much of the magazine i find this extremely disappointing i understand that to sell magazines the models probably have to conform to some traditional standards of attractiveness but those of us buying the magazine want to see women who are not only fit but also strong show us some muscles now and then as i said above the reader models are great the women are usually quite fit but they have muscles and curves too which is wonderful to see shape may be trying to make some improvements in this area as the last few covers have featured famous women who do exercise such as denise richards but they still have a long way to go and while they re at it i hope they will return to having their cover models dress in fitness wear not bathing suits they can still show off their model s physique and showcase cute fitness wear at the same time similarly i would like to see the magazine get rid of the fashion segment at the end unless they start focusing it on exercise clothing not haute couture if you are overweight and or new to exercising you may find the magazine discouraging but if you can get past some of the negatives it can also be inspiring i think it s up to each individual to determine whether a magazine like this is likely to hurt or help her fitness efforts for me it is helpful but this definitely might not be the case with everyone

1,choosing our first grill really was a simple decision we knew we wanted something quality and that would last us for a while weber was the only way to go in our minds now that we own this grill i can honestly say that hardly a day goes by that we don t use it i m really glad that we opted for the one touch rather than the smokey joe by the same manufacturer this grill has a hook inside the cover to hang on the side and ash clean up is very easy and for the two of us this grill is enough to keep us or even guests well entertained highly recommended
0,terrible product confusing not easy to use like mcafee not meant for a basic computer user
0,i received my order today and discovered as with all of the hasa products in my order that although more than one item is pictured only one comes with the order the item itself is very small x that fine i can accept since the cost was under two dollars and since the item is made of wood lifesize would make play a work out for most children however shipping only one without a clear statement that each order is for one item and does not include all the items in the photograph is false advertising
1,great delivery of a quality product and the speedy service is one reason i still use amazon today is b c of sellers and products like this thumbs up
0,the reviews are worthless unless the writer mentions the model of device they are using the batteries for fifty percent of the reviews here don t mention what they were using the batteries for do this service justice and mention the type and model equipment for which the battereis are utilized
1,hi this is the gate we have had on the top of our stairs some were difficult to open when you are also holding a child some were so noisy you could never slip down stairs while baby was sleeping and others simply felt like a strong sneeze would topple them over this one is great i love the fact that the lock is difficult enough that a year has trouble but not difficult enough that grandma has trouble
1,i find this game to be very indepth when it comes to the ability to change formations and plays just by what you see however my major disappointment comes from the graphics i understand the doesn t not have the standards of the but this was false advertising showing this very detailed game and not showing which system this ran for i just hope when the comes out madden will rerelease the game for it to give the owners something to whine about ea should be more infomational in giving what things look like to the consumer rather then just showing the best picture they have
0,must be in the window with direct sun cheaply made very low air pull best advertising campaign since salad shooter and chia pet it will not perform to the expectations that the tv ad promises glad that i did not buy more than one of them

0,first off i m a huge geek i love programming and computers and the internet you d think wired would be like some great magazine for me but the whole thing is just so whiney and worried about all this bad stuff in the world it makes you sick for every cool article about japanese robots you have to wade through like articles about how america is doomed whatever they need to man up
1,i just recently baught this weight tree since i had a weight bench and i needed a place to put the lbs besides the floor the the weight tree does hold that much weight and could hold more the only thing i do not like is that it does bend in a little when you put the max weight on a slot but it does its job
1,i wanted to buy a claddagh ring for my son and came upon this ring when it arrived i really was in awe of just how beautiful it is it is a larger more bold ring definitely more masculine this is a gorgeous gift for someone looking to buy a quality piece of jewelry for someone they love it s too bad that the ring will eventually be outgrown because my boy is only hopefully i can have it resized later or find another one that is this nice
0,i ve ordered this product a month ago i had mild acne i ve used a lot of benzoyl peroxide products etc persagel clearasil etc one day i saw a commerical for this murad product which looked too good to be true i ve ordered the product because the price was cheaper than some of the other products and it had real people saying the product worked i did follow the instructions on the products less than a week my face broke out even more i had some cystic acne which i never had before it was astonishing but the company said there was a purging state which i held out hope that it would be a minor setback weeks later again i started breaking out on both sides of my face and under my neck and chin area i am so dumbfounded that this product said it would make a difference within a month it s been month and weeks and i am so disappointed i ve stop using this product for the last days and my skin is getting better and i ve cancelled any future products from this company don t recommend it

0,poor quality construction the bristles on mine started falling apart on the first use plus it was much rougher than something like loofah you might as well tie a couple of shoestrings on a dog brush and use that
1,this is a pretty original horror movie starring two very likeable and attractive stars of the era katharine ross and sam elliot it s just fun not really all that scary or even too tense basically sam and katharine end up unwilling guests in a spooky mansion where the guests are dropping off like flies while waiting for an old spooky man to pass away and leave them an inheritance roger daltry makes an appearance the deaths are all way over the top and it s just fun dvd is the movie plus a trailer that s about it but the transfer is great considering the age of the movie great spooky flick for a cold night by the fire
1,the bowflex series treadmill is as good as advertised it was easy to assemble and the instructions were thorough it is also very easy to program and operate no time is wasted figuring out the instruction manual i also love the quietness of the motor because the machine is sturdy you will need some help moving it into place go ahead and get it ma
0,i will be honest i like dolph lundgren a look at his filmography you see b movie classics such as the punisher universal soldier and blackjack dolph has been going trough a slump storm catcher and the startlingly routine jill the ripper and the awful minion aka fallen knight but with agent red dolph lundgren hits rock bottom agent red first of all steals it s music from predator and it s plot from counter measures oh i m not finished yet it steals footage from storm catcher the scene where jon penner steals the air craft while posing as dolph lundgren now penner is dolph lundgren is for goodness sake yet they try to pass it off as dolph lundgren as the soldier stealing the aircraft for part of a mission this scene made me wanna throw up but i hung in there it turns out more footage is stolen i swear i saw footage from iron eagle and iron eagle ii i saw footage from crimson tide and i saw footage from counter measures what the heck was dolph thinking when he signed for this junk i have no idea when i was a teen when showdown in little tokyo came out i thought dolph lundgren couldn t sink lower then showdown in little tokyo then when i saw the minion i was almost sure dolph couldn t do worse well i pray he can t do any worse because agent red is one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my life this is coming from a guy who likes don the dragon wilson bottomline on agent red s cover it says once exposed you cannot survive take this as a warning
1,ok this definately looks very promising i saw a version of this on the flix channel about three nights ago it was good if that is any indication on how good the show is then this collector s edition box set of the older series should be better i am going to purchase this soon once i purchase it i will let you know how good it really is i ll give another review once i purchase this boxed set and have an opportunity to view the episodes a month ago is when i really learned of this series so i am truly looking forward to watching this series goddess anjanee
0,it s a gimmick looks good on tv doesn t do what it says i m embarassed to admit i even tried it
1,i like the story line of this movie but most of all i remember watching it when i was a kid of seven it was scary back then even with limited special effects and no graphic details watching it now was very enjoyable i found myself going back in time this film is in its own right a science fiction classic
0,i m pretty good at getting devices up and running but this thing is a complete mess they don t have the software figured out and the instructions for trying to fix it when it s not working are preposterously complicated note that it comes with no directions of any kind in fact it arrives with an unlabeled mini disc with no indication of what it s for what it is how to use it whether everyone needs it or anything else nothing but the blank disc note that this device failing to work is a frequently asked question on the polar web site and they have a list of about thirty things you re supposed to check most of which they don t explain as far as what it is you re checking for in other words they say check the whatever setting but they don t tell you anything about what that setting should be or what might be wrong with it most of the instructions are outdated don t apply to current version of windows or don t reflect current versions of their own software mine will be going back the first thing from amazon i have ever had to return

1,my three year old takes a rest instead of a nap which means he stays in his room for a quiet time so mommy has some sanity he can t tell time so he would come out every minutes to see if rest time was over in order to keep him in there for an hour i purchased this clock so he can see and hear when his time was up it works perfectly and he isn t anxious about when his time is up he understood the concept of the clock changing from green to yellow to red quickly and knows when the clock is red that his time is almost up i set the clock to announce when his time is up and then he comes on out no more is it time yet i get my full hour of sanity uninterupted
0,this unit will be lucky to be within deg of actual out side temp after several weeks of conversing the company sent me a different sending unit which turned out to be no more accurate than the original unit i would not recommend this unit to anyone
0,this product does not work it is suppose to make it so you can transfer data from cell phone to computer i wanted to take my pictures from my phone and upload to computer no way the cable comes with a id number on it and you have to get the driver off the disk that comes with it i have tried on different computer systems to make it work i dont know if the cable was marked with the wrong number or what the problem is the disk has files on it i dont know if one of the other drivers would work but i am very frustrated
1,this camera is amazing out of the digital camera s under i ve used this is by far the best beating out the kodak and the sipix i originally bought the sipix and it was junk don t buy the sipix that s under the kodak for some reason didn t seem like it took as good pictures as the finepix but the software was a little better being from kodak this camera can take pictures of resolution up to megapixels but i don t even use that option because the megapixel pictures are so amazing it comes with a removable memory card so you can take around pics at around at and it takes short videos for about seconds in mpeg format at a x resolution or more on a lower setting the lcd screen can easily be turned on or off to save battery power and the aa batteries it takes lasts pretty long it has a nice sleak design and the software has no issues with windows xp at least the only cons i could think of are that the only zoom it has is digital zoom which is pretty much useless and i never use it since it s the same thing as zooming in with your picture viewer on your computer so you can consider it not having any zoom the software for it works well but it could be better options wise the filenames of the pictures will default to a number depending on its order on the memory card so if you transfer pics to your computer more than once in a day since it creates folders based on date you ll have to rename each pic but i hardly complain since the pictures come out so incredibly well i m so happy with this camera if you want a camera under this is the one to get don t even waste your time with the kodak unless you want the one with optical zoom but that s i use it for general purpose taking pictures of freinds and such once in a while i take a picture of a sunset at and that will be photo quality printed on a full page creates crisp and clear desktop wallpaper size images and will created good smaller images to put on websites there s no reason to buy anything else go with the fuji finepix
0,i am a jane austen fan i love pride and prejudice and there are three very good to marvelous adaptations of that great novel however mansfield park is jane austen s most complex and serious novel and on the whole it is my favorite fanny price is the most difficult of the jane austen heroines not the wittiest or most beautiful but the one who knows the difference between right and wrong she is mentored by her uncle the righteous and honorable and i don t use the terms loosely sir thomas bertram somehow the adaptation of this great novel has twisted sir thomas into a sadistic sexual pervert moreover fanny is constantly babbling to us in jane austen quips that are not part of this novel they simply missed the point of the book the acting is okay the settings are okay the directing is sad but the sense of disappointment and betrayal by perverting the essential theme of the book has left a very sour taste
1,i had looked at numerous stands for my yamaha keyboard and didn t want to spend a ton of money for a professional grade stand at professional prices with that in mind the yamaha double x portable keyboard stand is a good choice at i had seen other stands that were not as sturdy single x stands and cost about the same price tips for assembly don t read the instructions just look at the enlarged image of the keyboard on amazon and assemble the stand the way it s shown the bolts for attaching the arms and legs come screwed in to the stand use the included allen wrench to remove them pros low price solid sturdy stand works for just about any keyboard the stand s height is fully adjustable and can be done in several seconds without having to unscrew anything cons there is no way to attach a keyboard to this stand no screws bolts or straps are included even though most including my yamaha keyboards have pre drilled holes for screwing the board to a stand the keyboard simply sits on top of the stand i was very disappointed about this the included allen wrench did not work for one of the bolts the bolt came screwed in to the stand way too tightly to be removed using the included tool the allen wrench only stripped the bolt it did not loosen it luckily my husband had a better allen wrench of nearly identical size and that one worked without it we would not have been able to loosen the bolt
1,as far as gps software goes there is nothing better available than streets trips and autoroute there are dozens of features that you can t find with the self contained gps units it is easy to add multiple stops and to optimize them into the best order night view is another great feature as are the topographical maps the new feature offered this year of easy linking to satellite photos of places on the map is also a welcome addition the only reason i m giving it a four is because of the following there is still no ground level or view of the roads for use in the gps function they still haven t added an option to exclude roads that ban trucks or commercial traffic form using them there isn t a lot of coverage for eastern european countries most notably nothing in russia nonetheless it is still better than any other gps software on the market
1,i just got this game last night and i am amazed ea sports really delivered with this one the race for the heisman mode is simply amazing all the problems and slowness of the game from last year have picked up and the presentation is a lot more appealing the game is probably the best football game i have ever played definately a must have for any football fan
0,all i can say is do not buy this i just got this stuff and used it for the first and last time it smells horrible it left a wax like film over my hair that was so bad i could not even get a comb through it i had to wash my hair with a different product of course at least times to get it back to normal again what a complete rip off
1,this is the way comedy should be done warm funny heart touching with a little craziness thrown in hector elizondo and raquel welch are perfect he s understated she s over the top just like the movie the story never bogs down but zips right along nicely the sisters bicker their father worries hortensia welch does her best to snag him and we laugh great fun a note on the rating for parents like me who wonder about the rating one can never tell these days there s one woman shown in skimpy underclothing and one sex scene along with sexual references and jokes so this would not be suitable for kids
0,i don t think so contrived movie with a little cycling thrown in to make up for a poor script think about it take a dump on a stock and get wiped out now you are a messenger i do not think so i know of a few new york stock exchange brokers who blew themselves up on trades but this is crazy thank goodness they kept the new york scenes to a minimum yes he was suppose to be at the nyse and not the pacific stock exchange as a previous reviewer wrote

0,this movie is the story of a gay cuban writer who eventually makes it to the u s to escape the persecution he s suffered in cuba and that s about all that can be inferred from this movie there are large chunks that are spoken in a different language but there are no english subtitles so you have no idea at all what s going on this disrupts the already choppy flow of the movie so that it has almost no cohesiveness at all whatever the message of this movie is whatever it s trying to convey it s lost in the plotless story
0,it took forever for this magazine to get to the address and it also is shipped a week to weeks after the magazine is already on the stands what s the point of having a subscription if you get the magazine later than everyone else i will never order a magazine from amazon again i ll go through the actual magazine company instead
1,i purchased these for my parents who are both in their s in order to bring some resistance training into their exercise programs my dad takes mile walks and manages the snow blower in the winter my mother does some treadmill walking they really enjoy using these bands and i think it is benefiting them they are simple to use and effective as if you work hard enough you can definitely feel it

0,i would not recommend this product when i plugged it in it would not stop chirping the directions said it might chirp a few times while powering up but the thing chirped all day also the volt battery that came with the product did not fit into the battery compartment the company that i bought it from told me to just throw it away although i did receive a full refund

1,first off i loved the book cover spine and all one of my all time favorites it s what first attracted me to this book amongst the other forward facing covers on the store s front table then the title i loved that just as much both share the characteristics of being straightforward to the point and revealing both are perfectly simple i read most the essays and came to think that a this guy really does his homework and b he has a vocabulary more voluminous than the decimal numbers of pi i constantly begged for my dictionary it s probably what gets him the press i knew before i picked this up an intellectual snob i guess he got that from the oprah incident but i also guess that there s lots of worse name calling that can happen to anyone in their career what s up with this culture that it s so unacceptably horrible to be labeled an intellectual snob and so enviously warming to be called a pop culture icon the attraction to franzen s work is that he investigates and reveals in a binary way he s researching facts he s listening to feelings he s processing both to give an opinion the best example of this is my father s brain in which he relates the alzheimer induced decomposing of his father s brain there is lots about the history and science of memory in this essay as much as there is about how a family discovers and lives with its loss reading it you sympathize you empathize and you learn equally as insightful are lost in the mail a look into possible reasons behind chicago s underperforming mail system the reader in exile a great reflection on the intellectual and emotional fruits of reading first city a historical and pensive piece about what pulls us towards cities meet me in st louis a piece that shares the two sided feelings in a trio of situations including the oprah incident
0,this is a very capable program that has too many nuances for just a simple dvd burn it is far to complex definitely for the advanced user i am sorry that i spent the money
0,this pedometer is easy to use and pretty decent looking those are the only good things i can say about it it simply does not stay on i too have had to use a safety pin to make sure i don t lose it maybe i have a defective device but this is anything but accurate i consistently walk a measured mile route every day one day the steps will be the next day the next day which is accurate are any of them i can t rely on it when testing the device for accuracy in walking steps it never got it right most of the time it was over the steps times it was way under the steps i would not recommend this one

0,i bought the version of this cable with the audio pair for an outrageous at circuit city out of dire necessity i have never liked monster cable because they use physics mumbo jumbo and deceit to market some seriously overpriced cables to unthinking consumers i opened the package at home to find that the color coding on the cables was incorrect and that trial and error would be the only way to get the right connection at their usurious price point i find this type of defect absolutely unacceptable and furthermore i would note that the cable construction was unimpressive using a cheapish vinyl jacket on the terminations thanks to circuit city s return policies i was able to return this junk and get my money back caveat emptor cable buyers spend your money wisely and stop the monster cable insanity

0,ok booty rap was good in the s when it was offensive and raunchy like live crew disco rick and the dogs poison clan etc but this is just wack weak lyrics corny typical krunk beats that start all sounding the same and is it just me are these guys as rappers just horrible there voices all raspy and annoying and one the guy s from the groups always does that annoying shout thing in interviews like hahhhhherrrrrr what is he on crack or something so if you like radio friendly pretty boy music then the ying yang twins are for you peace

0,although the product is very easy to use and the rice sticks together perfectly to make a sushi roll the rice is tasteless because it has neither mirin vinegar nor sugar nor salt in it commonly called sushi vinegar the nori wrappers are too small to make any decent sized roll and too thin to withstand any handling i have had better sushi rolls at the worst japanese restaurant the soy sauce is ok but without wasabi mustard you cannot achieve the taste of real sush
1,i would say that this is the closest that cheap trick ever got to making a perfect album there are only two songs on here that i m not one hundred percent crazy about the slow and gloomy depressing title track and on the radio which i think kisses up to radio d j s too much i love the rest of this this album was my introduction to cheap trick and i would definitely recommend it to anybody as introduction to them surrender is an out and out classic and possibly my favorite cheap trick song of all time like most of the rest of the album it s heavy it s catchy has great singing and interesting lyrics and it says all it has to say in three to five minutes auf weidersehen is another favorite tune of mine it may be one of the heaviest tunes c t has ever done i particularly love bun e s energetic drumming on it zander really rips his vocal chords to shreads on this tune another great hard rocker is stiff competition of the more pop oriented songs i would say taking me back is another personal favorite of mine probably should have been a hit dang it how are you shows off the band s terrific sense of humor i particularly like the reference to one of their earlier songs the other tunes from the first half that i didn t mention are also terrific particularly on top of the world my only complaint about this newly remastered version is that it doesn t include the lyrics which were included on the original lp version that is but a minor complaint i don t think cheap trick ever made another album quite as great as this one

0,interesting premise but the plot is like swiss cheese this review will just be a point by point of all the major things that i found so implausable that i couldn t just suspend disbelief and enjoy the ride spoilers alert i wasn t able to make the leap to believing sarah s sudden turn towards malicious opportunism as soon as she saw the cash when questioned about what she would do if she found some hypothetical millions she insists with chirpy disinterest that she would certainly turn it in just one scene of her looking longingly at a brochure for a holiday she couldn t afford would have established some repressed dissatisfation with her life situation but her general demeanor seemed to suggest not only comfort but satisfaction why did hank decide he would burn the money instead of return it if it turned out someone legitimately owned it surely it wouldn t be too difficult to anonymously return it without being implicated in it s disappearance the first murder after the old guy regained consciousness why did hank not try to negotiate with or threaten the old guy to keep quiet about his brother assaulting him for hank finishing the job his brother started didn t seem like an absolute last resort it seemed like he took the murder lightly when hank got home apparently he volunteered information to his wife about what he d just done what like he knew she d be understanding about it or something hi honey i m home by the way i just killed a man to protect the money wtf when jacob shot lou to protect hank why didn t hank just give the tape back before it got to that point the shotgun impact on lou s wife was cartoonishly ridiculous sending her flying three feet into the air when the blast didn t even hit her at an upward trajectory and the final ridiculous flaw jacob taking the fake fbi agent s gun and instead of just shooting himself before his brother had time to react he hands it to his brother and charges him with the responsibility of killing him setting up the final emotional crescendo of the film supposedly the explanation was that it wouldn t look like the fake fbi agent shot jacob if the shot was fired at point blank range but why not why couldn t forensic investigators at the scene believe an altercation could have transpired where jacob charged at the gunman from behind when he was about to shoot the sheriff wrestled with him and wound up taking a point blank shot to the head it really makes no sense one inspiredly believable moment i will give them film credit for is hank s difficulty in finding the bullets in the sheriff s office and loading the gun a lazier writer would have just had him find the gun loaded if the major plot developments were fleshed out in more detail to be made believable this could have been a great film as it is it s a frustratingly flaw ridden glimpse of what could have been and a waste of time to watch

1,i found this book to be very helpful it doesn t just give you the steps to do little tasks like some of the other books i looked at it explains the features and why you would use them and shows you how to do things from start to finish it also has a lot of helpful hints that aren t related to the exercises last night my husband installed vista business edition and couldn t find a feature he wanted and i was able to find the solution immediately in this book
0,i ve owned this camera a little over a year it was my digital camera it always had focus issues in low light i thought it was me but after working extensively with the manual after i finally had some time i discovered that it was the camera you really need a tripod for those low light shots i wasn t able to return it so i ve taken hundreds of pictures with it it takes beautiful pictures with good light and has a really nice size screen however the lens will no longer contract and i get an error message that is unresolvable unless i pay at least i m just going to get a better quality camera i will not buy sony again
1,i bought the cooler for my dell inspiron which tends to get hot because i work it so hard it s cut down the time the internal fan kicks in drastically is very sturdy yet light enough for me so i bought another wide screen black version for my hp pavilion which has more ram and so doesn t have to work that hard now its internal fan virtually never kicks in in both cases the fan is so quiet that i have to turn it on off to make sure that it is working the only improvement i would suggest is more usb ports stars because is perfection

1,i purchased the earlier version of this product two years ago i was disappointed that i wasn t able to use it for my second pregnancy most likely because it had been dropped too many times this new version comes with a cloth pouch that makes it much more user friendly also one set of batteries aa lasted for weeks the batteries in my old one would last days if i was lucky my daughter just turned two in january and is extremely smart verbally advanced and a joy to be around by months she knew all of her colors and could recite the abc s by months she could recognize all of the letters i believe we are well on our way to having a reading child by the age of do i credit the baby plus who really knows but we decided not to chance it and are using it again for baby

1,this dvd version of the movie looks great and is very enjoyable hayley mills is her usual irrepressible self and the supporting cast is top notch the feline actor in particular i don t quite understand the anger from some other reviewers about the fullscreen format it didn t bother me at all disappointment i could understand but this kind of vitriol it s still a very watchable and enjoyable film for all ages and i found it a refreshing change from the dumbed down kid s movies they tend to make these days adults will enjoy the suspenseful story retro style and feline antics just as much as kids will i d skip the remake and get the original

1,i ve been using avon products since i was a teen i started using the eye serum a couple of years ago after avon discontinued their wonderful eye gel i will be this year and have no wrinkles around my eyes and few on my face either though i am a dry skinned redhead contrary to what someone else here said i find that it does absorb very quickly i buy it because it is not oily oily makeup around my eyes makes my eyes burn and this gives me no problems at all also i have sensitive skin so i have to use hypoallergenic makeup this fills that bill too try it it s great
1,this is a wonderful film it has powerful messages there are numerous examples of how teamwork acheives something my favourite is the tale we are told in little scraps about how the kid sister got wounded driving a guy to the air base so he could fly a fighter and shoot down some japs the film is emotionally very powerful it is designed to make you hate japanese people and to support bombing of enemy cities there was a war on there was a need to get people to support such policies since the official policy was to put japanese americans in concentration camps the film justifies the policy similarly the film portrays the effectiveness of us military equipment such as bomb sights in a positive way they were hardly going to portray it as hopeless the film is not historically accurate it would not have been helpful to have produced a historically accurate film cnn reports about kosovo in were just as inaccurate for the same reasons

1,this science magazine should be held as a standard for the intelligent general science minded person articles are good not overly technical in depth at times it gets in its doldrums of articles but generally it holds it own you don t have to be a specialist in the field or hold degrees of the same but it doesnt treat you like you were an idiot it does at times takes some thought of getting used to their special topic issues may be avoided unless you want compendium issue of that topic well received for the high schooler either as the magazine or the website at least the layperson can be science informed the title of the magazine says it all

0,my husband and i loved the original amityville and were so disappointed by this remake with the special effects we have nowadays i thought this movie would have been great i was wrong it was pure hollywood garbage
0,this type of machine just cannot make good espresso espresso must be made with a fine grind of beans correct temperature of water and high water pressure to extract the right amount of flavor from the beans for the right amount of time with a quick no fuss machine like the tassimo some of these ingredients are missing from this machine s process so the espresso turns out rather sour adding the latte milk covers up the worst of it but it s not a great latte either stick with regular coffee in the tassimo and although it s not wonderful either it might get you through the morning
1,i m told by fellow film enthusiasts that buuel s later films do not show this spanish master at his best that his earliest films his famous collaborations with salvador dal for instance show an edgier more fascinating buuel whatever i saw his film the phantom of liberty for the first time recently and i immediately fell in love with it there are those who swear by his more popular oscar winner the discreet charm of the bourgeoisie but somehow i think the phantom of liberty is even more entertaining than discreet charm there is no plot to speak of in phantom this film is basically a collection of surrealist sketches that finds buuel playing with all kinds of different ideas and different images monks pray for a woman s sick father and then play poker with the woman and smoke a group of people sit around a dinner table on toilets and go to the bathroom to eat in private two parents desperately try to find their missing daughter even though she s right there in class when they call her name in the universe buuel concocts in the phantom of liberty anything goes the amazing thing about this movie is that instead of seeming like an irrational series of surrealistic sketches the phantom of liberty has a broad theme to support its free form structure it s buuel s comic vision of freedom run amuck sure the idea of liberty is appealing to everyone but as buuel seems to be suggesting even freedom has its limits the opening scene of the movie is set in toledo spain in as napoleon s troops attempt to liberate the spanish and are greeted with cries of down with liberty there can be times when we want the assurance of authority rather than the freedom to act in whatever way we please buuel doesn t take a stand one way or the other really he s just an artist who is intrigued by the idea and his interest fuels the free form structure of the film and its content almost anything and everything he can think of within the bounds i suppose of the same themes he covered throughout his long and illustrious film career is thrown into this movie and while some viewers may perhaps prefer the comfort of a movie with some structure i found its elegant chaos exhilarating only a master filmmaker who had absolute confidence in what he was doing would dare make a movie like this i think buuel pulls it off triumphantly here somehow he makes the movie seem almost logical the way it progresses the phantom of liberty is a sheer delight highly recommended
0,the characters are not appealing and the story is not interesting an effort to watch make up dyed hair costumes poorly done one man s eyebrows the suitor s are altered like a woman s no scenery or homes of interest except a glance at the sailing ships in the harbor not a pleasant pace without humor without intrigue a lesbian undertone in one scene the only positive thing i can think of is this good line of jane austen quoted fanny sums up in one sentence why she will not marry him women who have spent hours within romance in uncertainty will wish to sum up their certainty with ms austen s line his sole interest is in being loved not in loving this line is an exception to a lifeless script there now you do not need to endure the painful movie here are two lines re written by me for the woman dealing with a trifling man no man suffers pains of love on the stage for dealing with the infatuated man you have wounded yourself but not with love this movie should be re made by someone sharing the ideals of jane austen there is plenty to be mined from the novel to create a pleasant film humorous with singing with interest a movie can take the best of the book in the spirit of the book which this movie did not carry and make a movie better than the book this movie is bad any which way well made period romance films are pride prejudice wives daughters north south fairly made is under the greenwood tree i rated persuasion at stars for the wooden acting however persuasion is stars compared to this mansfield park persuasion has attractive scenery costumes beautiful singing and an uplifting plot though of interest only to women preferably who have already read the book
1,after the release of star wars episode iii revenge of the sith in theaters we got lego star wars a game that was a lot of fun to play simply because it emulated the movies rather well with all the characters being made entirely from legos lego star wars ii the original trilogy is even better for the simple fact of nostalgia any star wars fan will enjoy this you ll begin the game in the cantina in mos eisley this is the hub and from there you can go into any of the three episodes and play through them at the start you ll only be able to choose a new hope but after completing the first chapter you can choose the empire strikes back or return of the jedi as you go through the three episodes you ll some of the most memorable moments of the movies acted out entirely with legos these moments aren t only memorable but they re given a hilarious charm these moments are also from the actual original versions of the movies as well in other words han solo does shoot first the game is visually striking seeing your favorite characters from the original star wars films as legos is quite a treat not only do you get to have nostalgia with star wars but with legos as well even better are the hilarious antics of most of the scenes to benefit the nostalgia even more is how john williams classic score accompanies each and every level of the game for a star wars fan this game is the ultimate nostalgia as you play through each of the classic episodes you ll be in control of several characters not all at once but you ll end up having to switch at times you may only have two characters at others there may be as many as seven in your party at once your characters depending on who they are also have their own unique skills they can use jedi for example can double jump and use the force those who wield blasters have a grappling hook that allows them to ascend to accessible platforms the droids can open up special doors for you other characters like the jawas and ewoks will be able to go into vents and access areas the other characters can t in all actuality they re really no different than their counterparts in the original lego star wars also like the original lego star wars you ll constantly have to switch between characters in order to get through each and every area you ll have to switch to to open up a door for example more than one person can play at a time which is also really cool you can also beat up your allies if you wish and they respawn instantly the gameplay isn t completely the same though there have been some small tweaks made here and there the additions to the gameplay aren t huge but they are welcome as you progress through levels all your characters may be able to assemble certain materials together to form a droid to help them fight in the original lego star wars this ability was only given to the jedi but here everyone can do it there are also moments when you ll have to dress up as a stormtrooper in order to gain access through certain doors you ll also be given the chance at some point to dress up as a bounty hunter and you ll be able to use thermal detonators characters also have their own unique abilities chewie for example can rip a stormtroopers arms right out of his sockets all of these are welcome additions and that s not even all there is to the gameplay from time to time you ll be in command of vehicles landspeeders the millennium falcon the x wing and more as you take on some of the more memorable moments from the film like destroying the death star it will probably only take you five hours at the very least to complete the story mode of all three episodes however lego star wars ii is full of extras each time you dispatch an enemy whether it be in story mode or not you ll earn money you can also destroy certain objects and obtain money you can use the money you gain to purchase cheats and hidden characters each time you get a new character they ll walk around in the hub and you can switch to them purchasing characters isn t the only way to get them you could easily just use one in story mode and you ve got him or her you ll also get hidden characters if you ve got save data from the original lego star wars just unlocking all the characters takes a lot of time the importance of unlocking characters is so you can play through certain aspects of the free play mode there are places that in story mode the default characters couldn t reach these hidden characters might be able to reach it though and so you will find yourself playing through levels again the good news is these levels are so much fun that playing through a second third or even fourth time is no hassle at all free mode also offers a way for you to customize what a character looks like you could put yoda s head on luke skywalker s body for example this is mostly just a lot of fun to mess around with some combinations are just all out crazy you could for example put chewbacca s head on leia s body from when she s wearing the slave outfit in return of the jedi this really doesn t do a whole lot for the gameplay as a whole but it is quite fun to mess around with and the combinations are endless the only real problem with this game that i can really think of is that there is little if any challenge at all each time you die you respawn right where you left off and you have infinite lives there s really no such thing as a game over if you die the only penalty is that you lose money however the sheer fun factor of the game is enough to do away with that and still makes lego star wars ii a treat lego star wars ii surpasses the original in just about everyway it s a star wars game for the classic trilogy done with instant perfection if you love the original star wars movies you ll definitely want this game on the positive side based off the original theatrical versions and not the special editions beautiful game addictive gameplay co op mode several extras and hidden characters customizable characters tons of replay value on the negative side the story mode is quite short while not really much of a con for this game it s got very little challeng

1,of all the games on the ds no other third party title has made this good of use of the stylus and touch screen than atlus trauma center under the knife playing as a young inexperienced surgeon you use the stylus to cut suture bandage and more in an effort to save your patients you have a certain amount of time to do these tasks as well as keeping an eye on your patient s vitals while doing such surgeries like removing glass shards and re starting the heart of a flatliner there s a storyline to trauma center but it s only here as a way to make the game move along the highlight of the game and what makes it worth picking up is the fact that this is one of the titles that makes the ds the best portable system out there today the level of interactivity is inituitive but the game loses steam because it is ultimately too short after completeing each surgery you ll be able to re play them to boost your surgeon rating which is a nice little bonus in itself all in all trauma center under the knife is a definite must check out for all ds owners but keep in mind that the game isn t for everyone

1,this mix starts off heavy and never lets up with the quirky yet hard hitting vocal track grace anxiety by troy pierce as louderbach starting things off in a very energetic way this track worked well in sascha funke s boogy bytes mix but it was deep into the mix i feel it s even more effective starting a mix off things quickly lighten up with the bloopy claude vonstroke next and then it s into the m a n d y remix of tiefschwarz s excellent track damage featuring tracey thorn of everything but the girl on vocals two solid tech house tracks follow especially touane s snappy track bassic and it s right into the gritty churning techno sound of thomas schumacher s incredible track rotor the mix then hits a very slight snag in track which i feel is one of only two so so parts of the mix it s not bad it s just a little too light and bubbly tech house for my liking it s quickly forgotten as the mix races through with solid tracks in a row and right after the melodic freefall it s into tiefschwarz s own remix of a depeche mode track this is the only other slight miss in the mix for me as i feel the track was a tad too long at nearly minutes and could have been trimmed to better fit the flow of the mix another solid melodic track is next and we end with the dubbed out vocals of kate wax overall it s an exciting tech house mix that s a full lineup of solid tracks with not a bad one in sight and very few dips in the scorching pace of one very sound top to bottom mix do not miss picking this one up as it s easily in the top techno tech house mixes this year
0,don t waste your time or money with this dvd the best part of the dvd is probably the trailers and most of those are garbage also my dvd came loose in the package and scratched too bad it didn t do any damage to ruin the movie i couldn t wait until the movie was over i would have stopped it earlier but wanted to see if any damage was done you ll be counting the minutes and seconds after watching the first half or even earlier the last story was stupid and horrible and should have been left off don t waste your money spend it on the cheap horror dvd s because at least those can be somewhat entertaining

1,the lisse crepe microfiber hair turbans from aquis are very soft absorbant and they dry quickly the diva darling hair towels are not quite as nice hair turbans stay neatly on your head and are more convenient than a big fluffy towel if the turban gets sopping wet that means it s doing its job my parents taught me it s impolite to come to breakfast without a towel covering my wet hair this turban is not only great at home but also in college dorms
1,i love this car seat stroller it goes from car to airplane in no time flat great if you travel with small children with just one adult also great if running errands and your child falls asleep no need to wake them up to get in and out of the car however the older they get and the more they weigh the harder it is to get the whole thing in and out with them in it i still love this product
1,the card works great in my camera no problems i would recommend the product
0,the concept is cute although the size makes it a bit difficult to store when you are not wearing them but the main problem is that they give you hat hair compressing your hairstyle with the band that surrounds your head regular glasses go in between the hairs so everything fluffs out if you never take off your reading glasses have a buzz cut are bald or otherwise wear your hair flat against your head but be careful of buns the clic connect reader may be fine for you otherwise conventional glasses are a better bet
1,for two years now i have not had any problems with my motorola cell phone which is serviced by telus nextel over all i would rate the service as good not excellent rarely i will have trouble getting service in a area where i would normally get a strong signal this problem will normally last for roughly under a minute before my phone is once again operational i m a daily commuter between canada and the united states my phone doesn t miss a beat it will automatically switch from telus a canadian server to nextel an american server and still have the same great reception the cell phone itself is big bulky heavy and ugly it does not come equipped with any of the cool picture or video features it does have a direct connect feature so you can use your phone like a walky talky when talking to a friend with the same option on their phone that is neat and fun the reception on the phone is clear and crisp it will seldom cut out of the conversation therefore i did not expect the quality of the sound of down loaded music to be so poor what is most impressive is the phones durability this cell phone can really take a beating i have dropped my phone numerous times i have thrown my phone across a room to a friend who failed to catch it more then once one of those fancy little phones would have smashed into a million peaces on a road trip my phone had fallen off my lap out of the car and sat on the side of the road for three days in the rain i finally backtracked and relocated my phone i had recharged the phone and it worked as expected my phone has never let me down i have always gotten service and the battery has not died on me thus far the battery when fully charged will last for about thirty hours in low to moderate usage if you are looking for a quality phone built to with stand punishment and do not desire all of those new phone gimmicks this phone is for you
0,even though amazon specifically recommended this bag for the panasonic lumix dmc camera and even though i had to return it because it was too small and even though my camera does not appear on the compatibility list shown in another customer s review amazon annoyingly continues to recommend this bag for my camera to add insult to injury amazon tried to deduct shipping from my refund by claiming that the error was not their fault it took two emails to get the full refund and that was even after i put a large message in my return box not to deduct shipping aargh regarding the bag itself construction seemed sound and this might be a good bag for a small point and click camera that requires no accesories
1,tangled is actually a really good movie you have to pay attention or you ll get lost in the plot but other than that it was a great movie
1,i consider this to be one of the finest live coltrane recordings out there it was also one of the first coltrane albums i picked up and it was a fantastic gateway to some of his more abstract live recordings on followup releases like live at the village vanguard again and live in japan this is much more similar to afro blue impressions which is another overlooked release by this point in time trane had already done some work with eric dolphy and his playing was growing in a much more abstract direction as we would hear on a love supreme just one year later one of the reasons why this disc is overlooked is because elvin jones is replaced by roy haynes while jones was serving some jail time the absence of jones is noticeable but i still think this is worthy of five stars the first tracks are from the newport jazz festival and in addition to haynes and trane we have the remaining quartet members mccoy tyner piano and jimmy garrison bass tyner is especially amazing on my favorite things which i consider the best version of that piece in trane s entire catalogue i consider it to be a bridge to some of his later recordings this is because we get trane s two sides first of all there is great tone and lyricism in the first part of the piece however the song still goes on for minutes and the interplay between tyner and haynes for much of it is amazing rounding out the performance is billy eckstine s i want to talk about you with a mesmerizing credenza which is a staple of trane s technique followed by a minute version of impressions again we hear trane s two sides on one hand we hear where he is coming from which is the confines of other jazz gods like miles davis and thelonius monk on the the other hand we can see where he is going which is a much more abstract free jazz approach once you can begin to understand trane s more abstract side you will find later recordings less challenging such as interstellar space meditations or a love supreme in addition to the three newport recordings there is an extra track from november of from the village vanguard chasin another trane is played by haynes and trane as well as dolphy on alto sax and reggie workman on bass the presence of dolphy and the removal of piano makes this the most avant garde piece on the record almost reminiscent of early ornette coleman coltrane really cooks on this record and the sound quality is also pretty decent it s not as crystal clear as his carnegie hall concert with monk but nevertheless i consider it a great place to start for trane fans who are reluctant to embrace his later music
0,i received this sheet and was immediately disappointed the quality is very cheap and it wasn t a perfect fit i am surprised that this is made by graco usually their products are good i would not recommend buying this i would buy a regular crib sheet instead
0,this entire book reads like an grade research paper from an uncountable amount of grammatical and spelling errors to numerous repeated sentences literally quotes retyped word for word pages apart it s difficult not to get irritated while reading this the information on weezer is great but often times the author veers away from focusing on the band and gives too much information on things that even the most obsessed fan won t care about unfortunately this appears to be the only book on weezer out right now so if you want to learn more about the band in book form this is all you ve got i suggest just browsing around their official website because it s obvious that s where the author got quite a bit of his information don t waste your money
1,i have been buying plastic hummingbird feeders that attach to the window so i can have an up close view of my favorite birds i found this wonderful glass feeder that will not deteriorate and get brittle i had to replace the plastic ones every year i was concerned that it would be too heavy but the suction cups are very effective and the feeder was accepted immediately by all the hummingbirds right now there is snow on the ground temperatures below freezing at night and i still have a faithful hummer visiting every day when it gets warm enough for him her to move around great product
0,the author is a sociologist and tells of testing the opinions of two groups as to oj s guilt there was no test as to the extent of their actual knowledge you won t learn anything new from this book it has a long list of books on the subject but the author gave no ratings or summaries on them were they all equal in quality the oj case received more publicity than the oklahoma city bombing or the clinton impeachment the national association of editors and publishers has never told of the reasons for its play in the news could it have been intended as a distraction from other news in may the newspapers carried stories on how north korea was ready to attack and start a war this was repeated weekly in i read that president carter had been sent on a diplomatic mission to north korea must have been a success since the propaganda stopped could the double murders in brentwood have been well publicized as a distraction isn t two murders a day the usual la statistics how many other waiters just from mezzaluna were murdered each year are murders by organized crime often solved the book killing time noted that restaurants and health clubs in la and elsewhere were often used a fronts for drug dealing and prostitution if this explains the murders you won t find much in this book my experience is that most white americans made up their minds in june and never let the new facts interfere with their prejudgment

0,i recieved it promptly but it didn t work i took it to walmart to get a battery and they recommended going to a jeweler i did that buying a battery for twenty dollars and still cannot get the time to set right i ve read the manual over and over my sons did the same it looks nice but doesn t work and its been very aggravating i wouldn t recommend it
0,i had high hopes for this book there are too many parts that feel self serving and pointless i felt like i was reading the author s autobiography rather than reading a book on innovation the material on ideo could have so much better from a content perspective but it stopped short of providing practical information to the reader i found the preface by one of the author s former professors to be the best part of the book i would not recommend buying this book
1,like everyone else i was looking for a way to destroy cd s dvd s primarily those used as backups now that it s possible to back up almost an entire hard drive to a very few cd sized media it s important to maintain possession and version control the possession is obvious i wouldn t toss out an intact hard drive for fear of identity theft etc the same is true of your backup media version control may be less obvious but by dating my latest backups and then shredding any older versions i only have the latest there are good reasons to keep your older media i m just not going to debate them here the point is that this is an excellent shredder look closely at the illustration and you ll see what i mean desktop it s really compact and it does an excellent job i ve run all sorts of media through this bad boy and there s nothing left but confetti with shredded paper you could if you had enough time a flat surface and unlimited patience put the original document back together again not so with this shredder for paper i ve got a royal confetti cut paper shredder also purchased from amazon it s great and the two of them take care of most of my shredding needs my office is starting to look like oliver north s
0,i remember not quite four years ago when this magazine actually had pc substance and catered to a sophisticated pc oriented market now it s thin hollow interminably off topic and ad choked

0,while i only am a little over half way through this book i m finding myself hating will he s pathetic and boring and not at all a character that i can cheer for this book has been a tedious read overall i keep pushing through because i feel like it has to get better yet so far it has not i m happy that i checked this out from the library so that i can return it and not have it collect dust on my shelves the only reason why i m even writing a review is that i m so shocked about all the positive comments this book has received thus far i looked on amazon to see if my thoughts were shared by others i m surprised that they are not i usually like this genre of fiction but in terms of this book all it is is a bunch of whining and self loathing
0,i have enjoyed reading family fun magazine but unfortunately have only received issues i have not received any further magazines and am completely disappointed in the service i will not order another magazine from amazon because of this poor service i tried to get a refund and have only gotten the run around

0,we bought this toy for our month old daughter who just love to make noise with anything she also loves to stick things in her mouth because she s teething one day she was trying to stick the shaker with the bells in her mouth the metal from one of the bells cut her lip we let her play with the other ones still but the one with the bells is put away at least until she s older
0,office was a pretty good product the programs were powerful had a decent interface maybe not as good as the claris products of the early but not bad and came with a ton of features all on one disc the office release for mac was pretty much the same thing the only thing that really got annoying for me was the office assistant paperclip but it is easy enough to turn off office was a bit of a disappointment for me i felt that the improvements were minimal aside from a bit more stability in word anyone who has ever used word on a regular basis knows it s prone to crashing and in fact detracted from the ease of use one example is the clip gallery which went from being one of the best organizers ever created to becoming a program that wouldn t have received decent reviews in another is powerpoint s outline feature i always turned this off because it ate up monitor space and therefore made the actual slide smaller when you use smaller displays like i often do this is a problem the menus which hide some functions until you go to the bottom of them were also an annoyance the manual went from being a nice thick book to one half the size office continues making the program uglier now there are many tasks crammed onto one little panel on the right of the screen again this eats into the workspace the clip art system is even more cumbersome and many of the clips are online only now the help feature tries to point too much in the online direction as well now some people may not complain but what if you re using a laptop in the middle of the country i feel that the program is basically an uglier version of the same thing that was first seen in in fact the version was more pleasant to work with and almost as powerful on my macs i ve switched to keynote for presentations and pages for some of my word processing because the new office versions on that platform are similar some of the templates also look very apple s programs are updated on a regular basis and their templates look very modern now i know microsoft adds some new ones now and then but they should consider redesigning many of them such as replacing the overused arial and times new roman fonts with something a little more classy the program is bloated way too heavily i can run office comfortably on a with sub hard drive but can t even get on it a final gripe is that access is not user friendly at all file maker is a better alternative as it is easier to use and friendlier
0,released by atlantic five years after it appeared in australia presumably to meet high demand for ac dc s music this international version of dirty deeds done dirt cheap is a farce once again somebody had the rather strange ideas of altering the song sequence and replacing both r i p rock in peace and jailbreak two of the strongest numbers in the album s aussie version with t n t s rocker and love at first feel an ok if not spectacular song ah and problem child already featured in atlantic s version of let there be rock is also included in here the same song in two different official albums marvelous oh yeah and somebody hired hipgnosis in order to re design the front and back covers that was a cute detail but the aussie version s covers classic mid s cartoonish artwork are far more appealing who s to blame for this rip off somebody at atlantic records some members of ac dc maybe both who cares anyway once again now that i ve got used to the aussie album listening back to this product feels worse than a hangover from consuming adulterated low quality spirits every enthusiastic record collector knows that both warner music and sony music are serious labels that took and still take risks by signing up cutting edge artists and by respecting their will so it seems that with their approval of this re issue the surviving members of ac dc are the ones to blame for this farce to go on and on and on if this is so well guys we the fans made you filthy rich we deserve the real deal available worldwide at a reasonable price i only give this product a star rating just because love at first feel remains unreleased in australia how unusual a final word about this re issue i don t own it in the words of pete townshend i won t get fooled again in order to get bonus material you must go through an irritatingly cumbersome internet gimmick if bon scott undisputedly the band s most uncompromising member ever was still alive i believe things would be different by the way if you are interested in the real stuff please be so kind as to read my review of dirty deeds done dirt cheap import other items to be avoided the skimpy retrospective ep jaibreak and bonfire a rather steep box set in which at least songs are repeated twice in different versions none of these titles include all the songs left out by the adulteration of ac dc s first four aussie albums

0,this clock includes a chip that was designed to change the time when the new daylight savings time was effective the clock would not reset to the new time interestingly the manufacturer has not removed the clocks from inventory or attempted to inform buyers of the issue as of yet other than that it is a beautifull clock
0,though i am not a vogue reader i picked up this book out of curiosity to see what anna w s splashes in the tabloids were all about while the subject is only mildly interesting to me the author s prose reads like a page deposition against anna wintour from everybody who had has a major or minor gripe with her it s a heavy and boring read gossip if one can get over oneself and admit that it is entertaining should remain light and diverting in this book it is difficult to garner much sympathy for the subject or its author much less derive the slightest enjoyment from it i was very happy to put it down perhaps this lackluster effort will compel someone else to attempt a better job but then again when that time comes anna wintour may be have disappeared completely from public interest
1,in the beginnig of the s the turks would have succeeded in making the whole world forget about the armenian genocide that took place in turkey did succeed in putting pressure on the us government in though when a movie was supposed to be made based on this book so the then us government again put pressure on mgm not to make this movie a foreign government coerced censorship in the unites states just imagine that i hope the the making of the movie

1,i m more than satisfied with this scale i was concerned that i would have to buy a more expensive scale to get good accuracy see reviews of other digital scales in this price range but i ve tested it several times over several days and my weight varies by pounds or less over the course of the day my first weigh in of the day is pretty much the same as previous mornings sadly the neutral color grey and glass would blend in well with just about any decor and the lcd screen is easy to read with inch high numbers the only thing i don t like about it is that it creaks quite a lot when i step on it even though i m nowhere near its pound maximum load that problem is in my head more than in the scale i don t think it s going to break but it sounds like i ve got two people standing on it at once i m not that fat am i an added feature is that when i m craving i go into the bathroom and look at it and know that it isn t going to fall for any of my excuses tomorrow morning so the last piece of cake still sits in the fridge the scale has intimidated me into not eating it accurate easy to read easy on the eyes and intimidating i think it s a good deal
1,the kids at our church campout had a great time with the aerobie skylighter lighted frisbee s we bought for them they took a pounding and one spent the night in the pond and still continues to work
1,but a good debut album this is when i felt proud knowin ja was from ny no radio friendly s here just street for the most part but i guess when you were never really gangsta in the first place you can t keep talkin about it which is why i guess he changed his style now the subject i wanna hit has anyone noticed that guy named progressive why does amazon allow goofs who hate hip hop trash our culture and everytime i turn around its some damn rocker junkie hippie last time i checked rhythm and melody was part of music i dont hear none of those when i through on heavy metal or rock i m tired of our music bein trashed you know what im a go trash one of they artist right now
1,these little flosser tips put an end to my problem with bleeding gums flossing with traditional floss hurt because i always cut myself and deeply it probably saved me from serious gum disease and that i understand is expensive to treat so i d rather put out a few dollars rather than a few thousand dollars in keeping teeth and gums healthy

0,this sounds great in theory being that you don t have to get under the car to drain the oil fantastic but while this has still seemingly been made out to be a great thing for boats and cars i don t quite agree you still have to get under the car to change the oil filter so i d suggest saving and taking the ten seconds to drain the oil from under the car which is actually faster than using this device
0,on the whole bicycling is a huge disappointment i agree with some writers that the occassional tidbits of information are good but i don t pay for a subscription for a sidebar or two i read those in the newstand further as i will mention below once and a while there is a real gem of an article in the meantime almost everything else they do is poor the entire magazine is pitched at the readership as though we were all budding pros training obsessively and fighting with that last of body fat the reality is what bicycling s readership principally is is rich in their own pages they recently listed average household income of a subscription at so it s not people with the ability tor ride like the pros ride it s people with the ability to buy what the pros ride the result is a majority of articles and reviews that focus on just this bikes and as one reviewer said the occassional review of more reasonably priced choices around wait is not chump change advanced training and eating techniques etc as opposed to real world riding centuries and club rides touring commuting gasp etc even it s racing coverage is terrible its recent spread on the san fran gp one of the three most important races in the us was pages of photos of which were of people watching the race not the racing itself for me though the worst part is its hypocrisy in a recent issue there was a truly excellent article on what the author called invisible riders low income laborers who depended on their cheap bicycles to get them to and from work sites everyday yet the author mentioned several times albeit with embarrassment that he was riding a seven while doing research on people whose lives depended on bikes the author commented on the significance of these riders commuting everyday a movement which riders like bicycling readers had never been able to mobilize maybe because they all drive to work and the magazine does little or nothing to encourage bicycle commuting and the five bikes reviewed in that issue ranged from really really sad one star for invisible riders and the like and that s it
0,this handlebar mount mirror was most disappointing the adjustable mirror shaft has next to no memory and creeps into a position which is totally unusable don t risk your safety or your dollars on this product it s simply not worth the inexpensive price
0,okay i ll admit i bought into the hype oooo no sulfates oooo essential water oooo all natural no animals sacrificed in the making or testing of this vegan shampoo and conditioner i headed into the shower with confidence that i had finally dumped on a shampoo and conditioner set that would make a difference to my fine straight hair and what a difference it made the volume created by the products was all flyaway hair styled by the static electricity generated by my hair being devoided of any moisture that it once held by this lovely dessicant shampoo and no amount of the so called conditioner helped to right the wrong i tried various amounts of conditioner and left it on for longer and longer periods of time without any change in results after days of feeling the wicked witch of the west was having better hair days than i was i returned the product this product truly deserves stars
1,the bike arrived in fine condition no problems with bent or rusty parts like other people have reported it was really easy to assemble once i had assembled it i tried it out and found that it made a really annoying noise as the wheel went around as if the gears were scraping against something so i undid all the screws a pain and opened the plastic enclosed base there was a bracket that was meant to hold the pulse wires out of the way but the adhesive on it had worn off or something and it was just kind of hanging and would interfere with the gears so i taped it to the side closed the plastic up and that was that since then the bike has worked really well i wish there was more ability to move it back it is a good length for me but i can see how someone taller could have trouble with it the seat is not terribly comfortable which gets to be a problem on longer rides but it s fixable with a pillow or cushion the console is great has all the information displayed all the time plenty of resistance overall there are some problems with it but for under two hundred dollars i suppose i can t complain too much definitely worth the money

0,save your money you will go over an area several times i went back to my basic razor
1,i thought my first issue of your magazine was a little sparse it was a very thin issue the models were beautiful this was good but you knowif you would include more in depth articlessuch as really in depth stuff about skin and hair like i said before aging skin needs more done to it and some things like micro dermabrasion could be helpful also glasses a water a day is the most helpful thing a woman could do for herself beside plastic surgery theres not much for them to do but i will saythis to enlarge lips i put a vitamin e capsule on my lips and then honey and then a good lip moisturizer and leave it on overnight it doees make the lips plumper also i use baby powder on my face as a face powder sometimes i use this just on my nose and chin sometimes i use half mayonaise and conditioner and mix them together to make the mayonaise smell better on the hair sometimes i use vitamin oil in my bath water such as vitamin e a person can buy this at the dollar store im not rich but i do some things to help the way i look at my age then you could include pictures of mountains and rivers and stories of people then you could have articles on celebrities like frank converse robert blake really interesting ones like that paul newman has always got something to say interesting also what ever happened to actor richard hatch who starred in the hitchhikers someone told me the other day that the most handsome actor there was or is was yul brynner i didnt see that as i should i dont know if you agree with that or not but it would be interesting to see a profile of the way he lived i like brad pitt and those people are always great i love jennifer anniston because she she is higher up than most women in her thoughts and actions angelina jolie i really like too beacause women do like these women i miss johnny carson and they really need to find someone to replace him yes there is people like that still in the world ive found some of them well thank you
0,like many other negative reviews i ve experienced the same problems with this razor i guess less blades is more and i m going back to the power i ll be brief about the problems there s more pulling when you shave it felt like the hair on my face was being pulled out than cut the razor is harder to clean off i would get slight razor burn and i never get razor burn it s more expensive than other better razors out there so there you have it if you have to try it out hey it might work for you but please keep your receipt and packaging in case you want to get a refund if you re reading this is chances are that gillette s money back guarantee will no longer be around however there will probably be a gillette razor with blades by then
0,here is the short version i bought a fujifilm finepix digital camera for camera stopped working correctly snapshots have alternating bright dark horizonal strips across them i sent the camera in to fujifilm s service center for repair stating that the camera was always handled with care and that a camera should work for more than just month after its warranty expires the service center sent me a repair estimate for tax and shipping totaling i spent to send it to them so my total expense would have been for the repair if i accepted i contacted the service center and stated that i think they should stand behind their product and fix the camera once they verify the malfunction was not caused by user abuse and that i don t think that it makes sense for me to pay to repair a camera that stopped working only month after the warranty expired the service rep named christina asked me to fax her a copy of the original reciept and she would see what she could do i complied fujifilm returned the camera to me unrepaired with a note saying that i did not reply to the estimate now i will now send them the camera and its memory card and a printout of this review asking them to refund the cost of the camera its memory card and the shipping i paid

0,bobby bare is a great singer one of the most underrated country singers ever however most of the songs on this cd pale in comparison to his earlier work like detroit city and millers cave
0,tom berenger must have been desperate for work when he signed up for this embarrassment of a film it has the feel and tone of the kind of made for television movie you might watch out of sheer boredom and exhaustion on a sunday afternoon when you re too tired either to locate the remote or to fire a bullet at the television screen the acting is wooden and unnatural and the music which is supposed to be awesome sounds curiously like a bad rip off of springsteen even though the flashbacks in the film when most of the musical scenes occur are set for the most part in when nothing sounded like springsteen worse yet the sets do not look like this is very clearly a cheap production doomed from the start by an awful script terrible acting and a devil may care attitude about capturing the feeling of an era here s the premise of the film years after eddie the tempestuous and dumb lead singer of the cruisers has disappeared he died in a car accident but his body was never recovered a reporter decides to write a story about the band she has a theory that eddie is still alive and believes that the band may be on the verge of a renaissance if the missing final recordings named a season in hell can be located she forces her presence into the lives of the remaining band members who are by the way dull as dirt to piece together the band s history the reporter is so creepy and annoying that she d probably have a restraining order slapped on her nowadays ironically enough a season in hell describes quite acccurately the viewing experience
1,i love this scent it smells warm and spicy on my skin the eau de parfum is strong but not overpowering at all and the dry down is wonderful it also lasts all day long which is great because i m a spray it and forget it kinda gal

1,i purchased this tripod from street photo through amazon com the tripod appeared to arrive in good shape except that the operating instructions were not included i immediately emailed stree photo at the customer service address printed on the flyer they included with my shipment i asked them if they would be able to send me a copy of the operating instructions they did not respond to my email so a few days later i emailed them again once again no response i then emailed amazon com and informed them of the missing instructions and the non responses from street photo no response from amazon either as far as the tripod goes it appears to be a very good value for the money i gave it rather than stars because due to the missing operating instructions i cannot be certain i have properly checked out all of its features however i am certain that both street photo and amazon com rate zero stars for customer service i will use neither one again

1,i ve been playing video games since my atari and my lucky neighbors calicovision and i m happy to say that someone who grew up around the same time decided to start a magazine at play they go out of their way to show games that they think are great but that are never going to get any press anywhere else also since the mid s i ve been into anime but have only been able to go by word of mouth or more recently by what i see on tv thank you anime and cartoon network now i have play to read as it has extensive pages of quality anime reviews the reviewers are more than competent and may actually posses brains unlike the reviewers in most other game magazines they realize that their reader is not only the thirteen year old grand theft tony hawk player but also people like me who need humor and intelligence in my reading material finally the quality of printing and lamination on the pages will make you want to keep each one forever and i have reread and consulted past issues over and over thank you play for giving me something other than bills to pull out of my mail box
1,a great learning tool for childern of all ages
0,the eye piece that comes with the scpe is practicaly unuseable but of course you can buy the eye piece that really works separately from the manufacturer the whole thing was a waste of time i gave it to my five year old to trash at least he will have some fun with it that way it s realy just a childs toy

0,wedding crashers is the kinda film alot of people will love because it is stupid but alot of others like myself won t enjoy two womanizers fall in love one because he finds out that his gf is not actually a virgin like first off what does virginity have to do with love second who would actually believe that she was telling the truth when she said that she was a virgin then owen wilson s character fall in love with rachel s mcadams character and well that s the usual predictable romance plot the problem with this film is it s not that funny it seems to think it s better then it is i don t think i hardly laughed during this film the part about the supposive gay guy like people think he is gay so therefore of course because it s this kind of film he ends up being gay and of course he tries to hit on vince vaughn s character in a scene that is beyond creepy lets just say that gay guy is prob one of the worst actors i ve seen then we get a cameo from will ferrell alot of people i know find this guy so funny but i don t get it it just wasn t funny to me u know i loved the classic american pie that was just stupid for its own good but it delivered the goods to make it a great comedy this film wasn t so much funny as stupid for the most part i m not going to remember this film in years from now because it s just an average film
0,this game is heavily developed based on the actual movie if you haven t seen the movie and or your kid was too young to understand the plot then they might not get the game most of the adventures are based on the story plot a lot of the adventures are a bit dumb like mcqueen bumping alphabet tires into a truck mcqueen tipping over the tractors based on counting smoke rings mcqueen herding the tractors back into the pen mcqueen driving down a long road and picking up shapes mcqueen driving down a road looking for mack based on memory mcqueen dodging the firetruck water blast etc the only adventure i liked was the forklift picking up tire numbers odd vs even and installing them on the race car don t buy this game unless your kid is obsessed with cars
1,very nice bag and well made however i bought it for the canon dvd camcorder and found it a little small for carrying all the equipment cords and charger
1,i have had this awesome little device for about years now in that time there have been two attempts by car thieves to take my car a honda civic the first attempt it looks as though they saw it and moved on door was open things shuffled about this was while it was parked at my school in the midst of a string of honda civic thefts there had been no less than thefts of modified civics in the past two months which is what inspired me to buy this given the context of the situation and since nothing else was taken or disturbed the only logical conclusion is that they were after the car itself the second attempt was by a much more aggressive would be thief this one worked at the clutch lock for a good long time when i got to my car the next morning the clutch pedal covering was broken off and the pedal bar itself was bent slightly off to the right however the lock remained solidly in place they even broke into my trunk to retrieve the tools to try and pry it off they had no such luck the pedal cover was replaced for and all was well i would trust any car to this in any situation certainly you should use an alarm as well and be conscious about where you leave your car but this is a fantastic deterrent this product is the best bucks i have ever spent on my car get it

1,this software is wonderful i have been trying to find a good program to scrapbook digitally for many years i ve tried broderbund sp whose interface was too clumsy nova which was rather difficult at times many things you can t do and now this when i first took this out of the package and installed it i thought i had made the wrong decision with this software since there were very very few backgrounds templates or embellishements even when i opened the xtras cds that came with this i truly did not feel the xtras cds were worth purchasing since there are very few things on them but then i found the tutorials that are included on the cd and watched the one about making collages i didn t get halfway through the video i had figured out how to do it i have now created some of the best scrapbook pages i ve ever made within hours i had a beautiful collage letter to send with my holiday cards my husband s first impression was a heartfelt it s lovely what has so throughly convinced me of the abilities of this software is that i can take any image and make it a background i can create and manipulate text almost any way i want i ve been able to create my own embellishments as well as using downloaded embellishments from websites that sell it png format i feel like i have no limitations on what i can do now i imagine this software is not as sophistacated as adobe illustrator but then it probably isn t as complicated to use from what i remember that program has a rather steep learning curve you can also use the eyedropper tool to pick up any color from any picture background or element read anything in the program i was able to take the background colors and make embellishments that matched i can take a color from one of my pictues and make a background that matches you can also remove backgrounds from photos it takes a bit of time to do but the area around the image will be transparent this functionality has many uses you can also save your files in many different formats including jpg for file sharing etc there are so many more features i couldn t possibly list them here nor would you want me too too much time if you only use premade templates and don t feel ready to venture out on your own yet this software may not be for you unless you find a website that sells templates for this software you could start with something like nova scrapbook factory deluxe which i liked and when you start becoming really frustrated by its limiations it may be time to move up to this program you may also want to read a book about digital scrapbooking to give you ideas and alert you to possibilities the great thing about this program is that it isn t just for scrapbooking you can do all your photo manipulation in it i have always liked paint shop pro so much that i haven t been able to afford to upgrade my copy since version but i kept using that version i m so glad i got version as it is very user friendly too but please know that version which comes with this package is not the most recent version version is out now if you don t want need the xtras cds that come with this package you may want to just buy the most recent version and buy some embellishements from a website that makes png files portable network graphics format or make your own i hope you have as much fun with this software as i am having i highly recommend the training videos on the cd they really help
1,i found this smoker to be great i am not a pro so take my opinion as such i bought this last week and put it together in about a hour the only problem i had was that a flimsy weld on the control panel broke which meant it did not hook onto the bottom of the smoker neatly it was nothing a little electrical tape could not fix and was probably my fault for forcing it i plan on fixing it with a bolt and nut later this week the rest of the unit looks well built as far as smoking it did great i put some garlic and water in the water pan a mix of apple and mesquite in the wood chip bin and put the smoker on low as long as i had the vent wide open it stayed at f if i closed the vent the temp got up to f the whole chicken i cooked was great after four hours of smoking on my back patio the chicken was moist and had a delicious hint of bbq it was smoking pretty good for a couple of hours my wife had doubts about me buying a smoker now she has a bbq menu planned for next week all in all i would recommend this to a friend it is easy to use and keeping the heat consistent throughout the smoking is very easy with the propane controls and the vent
1,we played this game with couples and all of us enjoyed in very much we laughed the whole time it was a very enjoyed game for all
0,suit was too small not enough information available on the site for it i called amazon but even the customer representative was not sure the size i bought the suit as he suggested but it is too small
1,the nike system has really been a good motivator for me as a new runner i need all the motivation and positive reinforcement i can get the challenges and goals are a good way to keep on track as well i didn t buy the nike shoes i use mine with the marware sportsuit relay set up it s a great system and a lot cheaper than spending for a pair of running shoes when i already have a couple good pairs in the closet both products are highly recommended
1,this is a great book i love it and its very interesting great information and pricing
1,i am gluten intolerent or what ever you want to call it i get asthma from wheat flour so i ve spent the last years searching for the perfect flour i ve been using this for years now i love this stuff i use it for cookies cakes crepes pancakes waffles madalines yorkshire pudding flouring meats for crispy frying thickening soups and sauces etc etc the only thing that it hasn t worked for is bisquits i think because this flour needs a binding agent such as eggs or xantham gum with just the butter the dough after baking falls apart flakey and yummy but a total mess it also tastes kind of bitter raw but once it s baked or cooked it s exactly the same flavor and texture as wheat flour you can t go wrong with this alternative go forth confidently and experiment with all your favorite recipes using this wonderful flour i love trying martha stewart s cookie recipes this flour works perfectly for all i ve tried some recipes may require a little extra leavening agent baking soda or baking powder such as waffles madalines and pancakes
1,what i love about this case is its softness and its superior quality it fits just like a glove and it protects the camera at the time it never poses a danger to it i have had other older cases that scratched or even crushed the cameras this one seems to be an improved model it does not need to have handles because you are supposed to use the strap on the camera highly recommendable
0,peter segal s anger management is a film with nothing going for it it is best described as boring annoying and devoid of laughs mild mannered dave buznik adam sandler is sent to anger management counseling after an unfortunate misunderstanding he immediately develops a problematic relationship with buddy rydell jack nicholson the self help expert leading the sessions as the two men spend more and more time together buznik starts to wonder if his counselor is the one who should be undergoing counseling anger management just does not get as much mileage out of its premise as it would like it is essentially a one joke film that wears out its welcome very quickly sandler and nicholson are saddled with a script that fails to produce even a snicker furthermore the parade of cameos throughout the film add nothing to the story and just feel like a lame attempt to squeeze in as many recognizable faces as possible into the proceedings truth be told anger management is one of those projects that was green lighted because of the talent involved and not because of its quality
1,received exactly what i ordered at a fair price
1,this is the only political magazine i will read it is a great read if one is a conservative but someone with liberal ideas may not care for it
1,i think it s kind of poetic that i ended up getting the film adaption of ray bradbury s fahrenheit it was because i couldn t find the book anywhere i don t know how good it is as an adaption but i found the film thought provoking well directed and clever the film is set in a world where books are banned and burnt nothing is to be read except for the numbers on top of the bottles of pills and sedatives people of this age often take books have contradicting ideas the book burning firemen claim they make people unhappy sometimes they change people authors are raised on high in the world of literature as if they are more than the people around them for a happier society where everyone can be equal books must be destroyed they say montag is a fireman a talented one due for a promotion he has a wife he has a large television set in the wall though most people in this world have two and he considers himself a pretty happy guy a young woman approaches him on the monorail home having seen him around for so long on the trip home she felt she should say hello she asks about his job and wonders if he ever read any of the books he burnt it gets him thinking and he ends up reading a copy of david copperfield by charles dickens that is due to be torched like the firemen say it changes his life and suddenly this happy society seems a little more sinister than before i think it s a film that flows really well has a couple of nice directorial quirks and has that british feel in it s sets landscapes and colour schemes which i always like it s kind of strange that it s an english film since ray bradbury the author of the book is american ah well there s a lot of ideas being toyed with here the nature of memory of knowledge of oral traditions of control a lot to think about definitely worth a look for sci fi fans i think
1,this is my third skagen watch the design is ultra thin and the titanium consturction makes it ultra light the design is sophisticated enough for dress and sleek enough for sports wear they have proven to be reliable timekeepers and i liked this one so much i bought two more for my sons at less than each they are a real bargin
0,i used to have a graco metrolite stroller and i really liked it however i gave it to a relative because it went with an infant travel system i bought a used jeep liberty stroller thinking it would be an upgrade and boy was i wrong i will simply list the things i do not like it is quite bulky when folded especially compared to other strollers i ve had it is heavy awkward to carry and there s nowhere apparent to grab it handles i don t see any all tires went flat my local bike shop charged about to replace them all your mileage may vary my daughter was not interested in the steering wheel and since the battery that the previous owner left in it had corroded the sounds didn t work so i can t comment on those it creaks when you push it i m not sure where the sound is coming from but we oiled the wheels and it still creaks the player which is the cool factor and the only reason my husband has prevented me from getting rid of the stroller has these small speakers near the baby s head so in order to really hear the music if you re playing music you like you have to turn it up and the volume doesn t go very high for the same money you could probably buy some portable powered speakers and clip them to the stroller
0,anyone with a good taste in music will hate this magazine as it only rates bad bands from bad genres good reviews and whatever good bands are listed are often given bad reviews its all pretentious pop culture drivel for the conformist weak willed mainstream american the worst part of rolling stone is the greatest guitarists of all time list as they highly rate kirk hammett kurt cobain and tom morello all extremely overrated guitarists while rating eddie van halen at a very lowly and not even mentioning these awesome guitarists kerry king jeff hanneman slayer john petrucci dream theater trey azagthoth erik rutan morbid angel jeff loomis nevermore steve vai and joe satriani if you know anything about good guitarists those eight guitarists i just mentioned destroy kirk kurt and tom don t read this if you re trying to decide what good music is you decide what good music is think for yourself don t let mtv and rolling stone think for you
0,this has caused serious technical errors on my systems all new laptops desktops it will cause ms word to crash and also cause a number of errors on your file system possibly requiring you to re install your vista os worked well in windows xp and office environment and they claim this is vista compatible along with paperport the company will not offer me a refund i will pursue
0,ugh i did not even try to finish the book it is full of sexual content not recommended for anyone who likes clean literature

0,i have very mixed feeling about this tape when i bought it i did not realize it was for new mothers i have cindy s two previous workouts and love them both so i purchased this without question here are some random thoughts i enjoyed the different length workouts you don t always have minutes to workout even if you aren t a parent these workouts are lead by kathy kaehler not by cindy like her other tapes i found kathy uninspiring and uninteresting cindy does not seem as familiar with this workout as she is with the radu ones she is more window dressing in this video the amount of repetitions for the movements varies greatly which i found very annoying the warm up and cool down are very very short even on the minute workout c the music will put you to sleep i suggest hitting the mute button on your tv and listening to your own music if you are a new mother or beginner this is a good tape to ease you into a workout routine however i believe you will quickly outgrow it
0,looks nice when it was standing took several hours to erect doing it by myself had mile per hour winds and the thing broke apart and i had to throw it all out wrote to the company because it was only weeks after i received it and heard nothing back so if you live in an area that has a low to no wind factor it is a good buy but if not say goodbye
1,great features probably the best pedometer out there for the money the only reason i give vice stars is that i think the one i bought for my mom same brand and model is slightly more accurate a great way to track your fitness overall

0,a self absorbed mag that likes to pat itself on the back for feeling pity for the lower folks they named cindy sheehan in their january best of the best issue for best stand they are so diluded they think that nut is making an honorable stand only by using her son s honorable death to serve her ego secondly open the edition tom ford and you will be discusted with his self gloating and sexist photography of women i don t mind nude pictures but he only uses women like sex objects reese witherspoon highest paid actress in hollywood is showed holding a doll by it s arm with an empty stare into the lens the men are portrayed in sexual positions with the women and the african actors portrayed are dressed in animal skins revolting

0,we used these bottles for three weeks and we are very skeptical that they actually work as well as they are supposed to there are some additional drawbacks as well these leak in travel twice we ve gone to the park with and arrived with and a mess in the bag we see no difference in reducing gas and while these are designed to take gas away from the collar on what about all the air in the nipple where the air first enters is this a gimmic the flow is too fast we went from bottles with smaller holes and less flow to these which are far too fast for an infant

0,amazon is claming great entry level charger system charges four aa aaa nimh batteries in hours includes four nimh aa batteries it is only which makes these rechargeable an average capacity by today standards while if it was as amazon claims it would have been a nice step up shame on amazon oversight or misrepresentation charger is cheaply made it can charge aa or only aaa poor design the charger that came with my camera can do aaa go figure get something else
0,our library has just finished its magazine usage count and to my surprise the american spectator came dribbling in with only a couple of hits measured by current copies left on the table and check outs of older issues and yet our patronage here is very conservative perhaps people who once read this sort of thing no longer read at all or maybe as a couple of reviewers suggested with bill clinton out of office it no longer has the same appeal you can change my rating to five stars if you like for the sake of ideology but you still won t read the thing just like i don t read the nation anymore
0,i love the saitek wired gamepad so i figured the wireless would be that much better unfortunately my next purchase will be another wired pad to ensure no problems there s nothing worse than the few times i really need two gamepads that the wireless one poops out i bought this and the batteries died i sent saitek an e mail and they sent me two new ones great they worked then they died soon after hopefully their new wireless which runs on one aa battery will not have any issues however this one s a dud

1,i was unable to find my size in local stores and located this product on amazon for less than retail price even on sale was the jacket arrived in about a week its nice and warm very good quality the upper torso shoulders and elbow patches are covered in a heavy nylon which repels water and will help it hold up to wear and tear it fits great and looks good only small complaint is the elastic draw string around the bottom which cinches at the side and is a bit too long so it sticks out a little but all in all i m very pleased
1,i have listened to this cd for the last several years before going to sleep at night i love classical music and this is great music to help make my soul feel at peace and unwind after a taxing day
1,just as my title states this item was purchased as a gift my friend loves the pendant but upon arrival it had a small scratch on the body of the horse
1,i m so happy that this product finally made its way here in the states i was introduced to this particular brand a few years ago by a friend when i went to visit her in osaka and i ve been hooked since i m one of those unfortunate few who for some reason or the other always end up with panda eyes at the end of the day due to mascara run off i ve tried everything from cheap to expensive and from regular to waterproof mascaras to no avail somehow though this mascara because of the unique properties of the fibers will not smudge on the skin no matter how humid or wet the day is the cool thing about it is that if you rub your eyes the fiber will fall but not stain the skin thus eliminating the panda eye effect the fibers will coat the eyelashes and dry up forming a sort of tube around the lashes and are surprisingly easy to clean at the end of the day no special solutions needed when you clean your eyelashes you can actually see the fibers loosen up and leave your lashes without any residue i am also a contact lens wearer and this product unlike many other mascaras doesn t irritate my eyes and lasts practically forever this has to be the best mascara i have used yet and that is saying something even the expensive department store and specialty mascaras pale next to this and i even bought it at a local japanese drugstore never leave home without it it s possibly the last mascara you ll ever need

1,i ve had these chairs for about a week i bought two and they look fabulous on my front porch they are comfortable too my expectations were exceeded like another reviewer i too searched for adirondack chairs and found the prices to be ridiculously high this chair and ottoman for shipping is a steal the quality and construction seem to far outweigh the price i only gave stars because i can t comment on the durability and maintenance after only a week strathwood recommends teak oil a couple of times a year i also purchased the folding table to place in between the chairs what a set if you re thinking about this chair don t hesitate you will not be disappointed
0,the recipes included are good but this is not a cooking magazine this is a women s fitness magazine in disguise while i am all for a magazine that focuses on overall health and fitness it shouldn t advertise itself as a cooking magazine there is way too much other junk if i wanted a makeover or an exercise routine i don t expect to go to my cooking magazine to get that

0,this book is very disappointing as is most of gunaratna s work on islamist terrorism it s the sort of stuff governments and many of the public want to hear ie bin laden and aq are everywhere responsible for every terrorism attack and all regional terorist groups such as ji are aq franchises total bollocks the book lacks solid and verifiable reserach and is written by a scholar who spends most of his time doing alarmist media commentary
1,i was introduced to this book while staying with a friend and i was hooked i went home and bought it so that i could finish it i didn t know much about buddhism before i read this book ms boorstein s stories read a bit like the chicken soup for the soul books she has short wonderful stories that demonstate current day people practicing the buddha s teachings you do not need to be a buddhist to appreciate this book it s very inspirational since this book i have read several more books to learn about the teachings of buddha
0,i bought this carry case for my son s l max it works well for carrying the unit and all the games he has for it i wouldn t advise dropping it on a hard surface of any sort it is not nearly padded enough to be carrying a hand held gaming unit of any sort my son likes to take his l max to school with him for mornings before school begins i place it in the carrying case and then place the carrying case inside of his backpack to give it some extra cushioning if i had known how little padding there was in this particular carrying case i probably wouldn t have bought it there is a carrying case out for the nintendo wii that is similar in style but much more padded i almost purchased it but then thought that i should get something designed for the leapster l max if i had it to do over i would have purchased the case for the wii it might have been a little big but the extra padding would have made up for it overall it is not a bad purchase but for the money you should get something a little more protective after all the leapster starts at and the price goes up accordingly for the l max
1,i m an admitted soap snob so i ve probably tried just about every soap there is mistral soap is right up there with the best first of all i have to mention the customer service i had bought another brand of soap that came in a very pleasing scent combo that mistral didn t offer i emailed mistral s customer service asking them to consider making it i got a reply right away and after a few email exchanges was told they would see what could be done i like that being responsive to the customer what do i like about the soap for one thing the size it s huge at oz i also like the scents offered very pleasing combinations that stay on the skin in a subtle way once you rinse and dry best of all is how it lathers up on the skin and once rinsed off leaves no residue it does leave the skin soft
0,i made the mistake of subscribing to this magazine sight unseen i received a very good offer to subscribe that i didn t want to turn down i thought this was going to be like a better homes and gardens or country living but it wasn t this appears to be a good choice for design professionals i was just not very impressed

1,although each track is beautiful in it s own way it s their sum that makes this such an incredible album in my mind where felt mountain remained rather mellow and etheral thruought the entire album black cherry offers more in the way of diverse melodies and tempo the tracks seem to be placed specifically in a way that makes the album feel like a journey and personally like a lay s potato chip not able to listen to just one yeah i need the whole thing
1,but no calories count i love this watch despite that it s well designed the chest strap also links to the machines in the gym most that say polar ready so that was a great surprise the chest strap has a battery that is user serviceable as well as the watch so you don t have to send it to the manufacturer like the polar hr overall i think is a good buy but the is missing the calories count that would be my only upgrade
1,i installed it in my new computer with the easy to follow steps and i find that it gives me wonderful protection i would recommend this product to everyone i am very satisfied i feel my computer is very well protected
0,field in a bag claims to be the perfect way to get a baseball game going while this may be true the number of games you can actually play with this set will be one if the set even makes it through the game first off with these bases you must set up the field using the wooden mallet the pound a flimsy plastic stake into the ground with one of my sets i bought unfortunatly at the same time not knowing their reputation the wooden mallet wasn t even glued together it had fallen apart so i had to just use the head then when i put the stakes into the ground out of the sets i had at least in each set broke while i was placing them to actually place the bases the set gives you a string device that helps you measure out the field this was handy except for the fact that it took me min to untangle the mess and then when i went to second base realized the string was not long enough granted one could place and and then figure out where went but the picture in the set up shows that the string will measure the base however it definintely is not the right length after placing the bases the team is now ready to play however don t wear cleats with these bases the bottom of the base says not recommended for use with cleats and boy were they right with our game we had tball children using the bases and even their little cleats and not all the kids had cleats tore them to shreds our bases lasted about one hour before they were torn and the inside cotton coming out it was very unfortunate seeing as though we purchased three sets and all were done by the end of an hour this non profit won t see that money again so unless you plan on using these bases on the grass for easy set up do not plan on wearing cleats and not playing a true game of baseball softball you would probably be better off buying the flat bases for temporary use and they can be left outside afterward too just not impressed sorr
0,i m writing this reveiw on the company discount ramps rather than the ramps themselves they charged my credit card immediately upon ordering then weeks later when i inquired about where these ramps were they told me the manufacturer hadn t received the metal to build them yet and the build time is weeks just be careful people
0,the casting for this production could scarcely be better of particular note is the harrowing performance of judi dench and it s one of shakespeare s best plays that said this film of a production on stage doesn t quite carry the viewer s interest for the entire play there are times when the actors seem downright pretentious you feel as if they re tellings us we know how deep this is so appreciate it please that s too bad since macbeth is a work thriving with intense imagination with a few hallucinations thrown in so it should invite a great film sadly this relatively slow moving production isn t it there are of course wonderful moments with mackellan and particularly dench no one plays the scene where lady macbeth goes crazy better than dame judi i just don t know if that alone makes this a worthwhile purchase for my money kurosawa s throne of blood is a far better choice

0,i have a and year old and this device did little to deter or prevent them from raiding the fridge while their mom and i were asleep a couple of good hard yanks by your child and this device fails this might me a good product for infants and toddlers but if your child is over years old try something else like the lock release fridge latch by safety but be aware that even though these are by far superior you ll still have to place about of these safety latches on your fridge door to keep the little ones from defeating them that s what worked for us anyway i ll be so glad when they grow out of this fridge fascination
0,graco might be making a killing with this product as they charge over for something that appears to be made with less than worth of materials the seat is much too big to fit in a regular compact car such as a nissan sentra unless you decide to install in a center seat location which has the advantage of being safer but much more inconvenient the documentation in my opinion is very poor and i ve installed linux systems from scratch w less documentation bad documentation could lead to unnecessary infant injuries and deaths if people don t completely understand the instructions let s not talk about the styling wasn t black red and gray popular in the s or did i miss the come back somewhere i hope i can find something better i m giving this product two stars because it will do the job but i expect much more from a product
0,blind items has the same writing style as at least one of rettenmund s other books boy culture he goes on for pages and pages to describe something that could have been said in two paragraphs kind of reminds me of the articles you read in the sunday magazine section of your newspaper if you like this writing style rettenmund s books may be for you personally it drove me crazy and i set the book down after the first few chapters

0,this milk is advertised as vanilla milk but its regular white milk
0,the description of this product on the amazon site does not match what i received like another reviewer mentioned the product was actually shipped from the uk so it took longer and several features listed as being in the product are not there specifically exporting saving of loops is not allowed and there is no library of loops included either it seems to me to be basically like a demo version also even though it was advertised as being new in the box all i got was what looks like a used cd with no manual or cd key so much for upgrading later i am returning it the sku should be removed from amazon or the description should be changed to fit what is actually being sent out
1,a very funny and insightful examination of young adults all looking for love happiness and meaning the film takes place on new year s eve and follows many different young people who somehow all eventually end up at the same party which the hostess later wakes up to find she slept through elvis costello makes a cameo and provides a running joke in the last third the soundtrack is great all late s early s pop and new wave and the one who steals the show is dave chappelle as the cab driver who manages to give a ride to practically every character at some point dispensing equally silly and profound wisdom along the way on everything from friendship and destiny to life before an afro and how to get booty smiling at a girl is very important as is avoiding talking about death everyone knows they re gonna die someday they just don t want to hear it from you ben affleck is very amusing as a clueless suitor oh and courtney love was actually bearable all in all a very smart enjoyable ride
1,i have bought these krackers before at our local health food store and was delighted to see that they could be delivered to my door i received my shipment of these delicious spelt flatbread krackers this week however the sell by date on each package is a week old they seem to be fresh enough now but i am wondering about how long they will keep past the sell by date it also makes me wonder about other amazon orders and the sell by dates on them i will be wary of ordering other items with a short shelf life
1,i bought this as a present for my daughter i was very pleased with the quality and the finish of the ring if anyone wants additional instructions about how to put it together check wikipedia i believe there is even a video i highly recommend this ring for people who enjoy sterling silver symbolism and something just a little bit different
1,as expected the new razor delivers a close and comfortable electric shave even though it runs much slower than earlier models the slow speed does make it very quiet and the new cleaning method is very handy just noticable disappointments the external power supply is a rather combersome change from former norelco products the exclusion of a storage case is certainly an unwelcome feature of an otherwise good product at a premium price
1,after reading dozens of reviews for both this case and the psc i was still undecided on a case for my canon so i purchased both to see for myself which one would work because red is my favorite color i really wanted the red case to fit psc the camera will fit in the case but it s a very tight fit i had to shove the camera in the case to make the snap close the psc is still a very snug fit but allows for some extra breathing room which i feel is better for the safety of the camera in addition here s something to consider if you re deciding between the two cases the inside lining of the psc is more of a rigid nylon material while the lining of the psc is a softer felt material the case overall is still rigid but i like the thought of my camera resting against a softer lining based on that alone i m going with the psc i feel that this will be more friendly to the screen on the both cases are a very nice leather and are very attractive i m pleased with the canon brand
1,this item works for me perfect i had ordered two of them but found one did so well i have returned the second one there was nothing wrong with it i just had no need for it for the record i am not using this for a child it is used to restrain the movements of a pet it works perfect for that so i am sure it would do wonders for a child
1,i bought this vaporizer several weeks ago i feel better after i use this it created steam very fast about minutes after plugging you may have to fill some salt to make it create a lot of steam however a lot of steam means the water will decrease rapidly so if you want to use this vick for a long time about hours you may not need to use salt
0,as the director and actors of this mess should on their skinny french knees complete waste of film and your time not erotic sexy was that actress really a woman was her boyfriend really a man or visa versa damned if i could tell and that old man who tired her up ya think he had enough rope the movie was as clinicial as the gyno exam she went through french people are not pretty and this woman was not only not pretty but she drifted through the entire movie in a coma even when she got screwed she looked like she was in a fog save you money and your eyeballs and buy some french fries and eat them on your porch for the same experience
0,if you are a weightlifter or bodybuilder the yoke piping will cut into your lats and pecs unless you buy a larger size than usual this restrictive band makes the jacket rather uncomfortable the velcro isn t quite right either the material itself is nice to the touch but the design is flawed wasn t worth even the sale price

0,i wanted to confirm that i had the same experience as the other dissatisfied reviewers the everlast bar comes with nuts that don t fit the screws the nuts are laced with a hard inner plastic lining that requires you to use powertools to force the screw to chisel through i returned it for a new one thinking that surely this was a mistake but the replacement had the same pieces horrible however i was determined to make my purchase work so i put it together with force once i had everything assembled i found that the bar does not keep together by design even with the screws pretty secured the outer loops on the bar they are supposed to serve as multi purpose handles can unhinge and detach from the bar because their connection to the bar on one side is not secured by screws that s absolutely ridiculous when this is clearly supposed to be keep you safely suspended in mid air thoroughly dissatisfied i ve used the door gym and it s much more secure than this

0,now on their sixth studio album and second on a major label carbon leaf plays it safe with the inoffensive rock pop of love loss hope repeat lead vocalist barry privett has a warm pleasant way of delivering his lyrics and renowned producer peter collins fulfills his duties nevertheless the song collection is most notable for its power of subtlety in fact it is so subtle that not one song is memorable some lyrics are heartfelt the war was in color recounts a conversation between a grandfather and grandson lead single learn to fly regretfully summons up inner strength but with such flat by the numbers melodies these songs have little to stand on everything sounds just fine but nothing is endearing every guitar strum and drum beat can be predicted ten seconds prior to its appearance and privett despite his appealing voice could easily be singing one extremely long song this project is obviously well intentioned but many other bands have done this before and better these guys without a doubt have talent but this album will soon be forgotten for good reason next time they will hopefully carve out a more unique sound than the one on this record

1,philosophy products are very eye catching their smart clean looking bottles and the cool names given to each i work with skin care products and don t always believe what they claim there are usually far too many claims to be made that simply can t be done to someones skin this product however is pretty good it s a fairly good moisturiser that could honestly sell for less considering the cost of the product but it does do the job it promises the only problem i have with it is that for someone with sensitive skin there is far too much frangrant extracts in here it cannot be good for sensitive skin i d recommend this to dry skin people only
1,i ve been struggling with heat issues for quite some time with my gaming pc and have gone through numerous fans and combinations trying to find a way to keep it cool i had just about resigned myself to just running with the case open all the time until i bought this after shuffling my pci cards around so as to allow a space between this and my ultra i fired the machine up and closed the case and did some gaming all the while keeping an eye on the temperature of the card this fan easily dropped the temperature on the card degrees celsius when the graphics are running full bore once the chaos on the screen starts to subside the cooling is even better as an added bonus this will cool the card down quick once you exit your game i thought for sure that i would have to trade off cooling for a lot more noise and i was surprised to find that i had to listen for it in order to hear it about the only complaint i have on this is that the fan speed is manual with a slider on the back which i knew when i bought it so it is not temperature sensitive still deserves stars though
0,i am a personal trainer and i was asked by a friend to check this elliptical strider out for them i was suspicious from the price thinking that it really couldn t be an elliptical machine but checked it out anyway as i suspected this is simply a glider similar to what was on infomercials years ago except for the tony little tv glider most of those or more gliders that were on the market are all gone there is a simple reason that true elliptical machines are so popular in health clubs and that there are no gliders in health clubs with ellipticals and treadmills users lift their legs with each stride which of course is more like the natural motion of walking and running this of course engages many more muscles than the gliding or swinging machines of the past also ellipticals have a flywheel to allow the user to add resistance while still keeping a smooth motion i ve read the other reviews of this machine and realize that certainly any movement is better compared to doing nothing but it is a question of time you could swing on one of these machines for hours and while it might be kind of fun for some people it will never come close to a true elliptical i m not promoting any one brand and i have no ax to grind except that it is somewhat annoying when companies like sharper image continue to intentionally mislead the public because they know it sells products the reason elliptical machines are called elliptical is that the user s foot goes through an elliptical path gliders just swing back and forth like a pendulum if you don t believe me ask any trainer or exercise physiologist this is misleading marketing and no doubt they know they are using that name to cash in on the popularity of the real ellipticals my advice to my friend was to save a little more money and get an elliptical

0,if this had been the first album in the hip hop hits series it would not be a promising start there are a few decent tunes on here but as someone who admired the quality of the earlier source albums i must express an intense dislike for hip hop hits vol there used to be a time when the source gathered the biggest and best tracks from the rap indusrty for their compilations now benzino has turned the series into a shameless promotion for his own favorites how else do you explain ja rule being here here is a song by song analysis of this disaster youngbloodz feat lil jon damn c this song is perfect example of why people are getting bored with sothern crunk it s lame and boring as it shows lil jon becoming a one trick pony not a good song to open an album with wyclef the industry b wyclef is very talented but this song was never a hit it should be heard for its quality though even if it only touchs topics breifly it is clear that wyclef is above most of his peers in everyway sorta like chingy right thurr b not my favorite rap song its better than average though it kinda grows on you he reminds me of juvenile it s content is not original but chingy makes it his own with a relaxed flow and style young gunz can t stop won t stop c if this standard work is what roca a fella has in it s post jay z future the label is going to be in real trouble they re good but they have to be better than good to stand on their own westside connection feat nate dogg gangsta nation b it was nice to see westside together again the style and talent cover up for the somewhat standard material at the bare minimum the song is stylistic and very enjoyable ja rule clap back d this anti eminem dis is just border line pathetic and lame any eminem song is a bigger hit and better than ja rule s weak new stuff if ja rule wants to return to his position pain is love brought him to he must work much harder kanye west through the wire c kanye west has enjoyed chart success through alot of hype but i find this song to be very pedestrian for rap the lyrics don t define kanye as an original rapper and the use chaka kahn s through the fire doesn t make a very appealing beat gang starr skills c the group isn t that good to begin with and this song has none of the fun that militia had gang starr has a decent hardcore sound that needs to be refined in order to define themselves j kwon tipsy b this song is fun to listen to but that still does not make it any better than average it s not really about anything and gets kinda tiresome towards the end you may be looking at your watch he s too overpraised e feat clipse quarterbackin c the track is enjoyable but was never that popular and is pretty forgetable e and clipse just aren t that talented it almost feels as if it was made strictly for the madden football video games fabolous feat tamia into you a just great hip hop with style and substance it s so nice to hear a gentler more positive hip hop songs one that doesn t hammer the listener but brings out emotions lightly he is one of the best rappers of with both his album and it s singles t i be easy c he has been compared to jay z and nelly despite the difference that he lacks the talent those artists have plain boring generic rap from an artist who ofers nothing new to the game no more needs to be said one must also wonder why this was chosen over his bigger not exactly better though hits rubber band man and let s get away cassidy feat r kelly hotel b a sorta fun track r kelly does as much as possible but he even he can t make cassidy sound original to be honest this was a huge top hit though so it kinda does belong here ying yang twins feat lil jon the east side boyz salt shaker b surprisingly the beat and production make this song rather entertaining it s much more fun than it has the right to be given the non spectacular artists involved scarface recognize c scarface used to be an exceptional rapper but now he s trying to regain glory that is no longer his why listen to this when you could just buy his older albums the untouchables featuring benzino relationship with me my gun c just a standard benzino track tacked on for shameless self promotion i wouldn t mind so much if the songt had actually been worth listening to atleast bang ta dis on vol was a good song bottom line benzino has ruined the once great source series in the blink of an eye if you want to hear a great source album buy hip hop hits vol a source album with the biggest and best raps of a few good tracks are not enough to balance out all the mediocre ones to put it in short terms with so many good compilations out there why spend money on a bad one i would not buy this album with a gift card

1,i have been buying this brand of boneless and skinless sardines for years and still love to just open a can and eat them for a snack i know that being boneless and skinless lowers the calcium level but i ve never liked the crunch or taste of eating a whole sardine right from the sea and they are packed in olive oil which is loaded with omega s too so it s as good for you as are the sardines however i am not so sure about their actual mercury levels buying them from amazon with their off sale on purchases is a great price i ve even found that many of the local grocery stores as well as costco and bj s no longer carry this product or their price has skyrocketed it s great to be able to stock pile them from amazon if you like sardines you ll love these and they are just so nutritious for us all

1,whenever i think of the second world war the two places i usually think about in terms of carnage is the eastern front and the war between nazi germany and soviet russia the other is the pacific campaign between the usa and japan one of the reviewers wrote i m glad the russian won so am i and what a bloody war it was the number of casualties and amount of destruction make what occurred in the others parts of the globe except asia seem pale in comparison the russians suffered greatly at the hands of the germans and the german army paid one hell of a steep price also it was in the east where the germans committed some of the most horrendous atrocities known to mankind it was in the east where extermination camps were set up to murder millions of jews the german program of the final solution everything i have ever read about the second world war concerning the eastern front is one of brutality on a scope that is horrifically mind boggling it s as if life were cheap and each day may have been the last this documentary does a very decent job in attempting to address the fighting between these two armies from barbarossa to berlin it is one of the best documenatries out there at least for the minutes that the film devotes to the eastern front i don t believe this is the definitive documentary as more and more information is being released now that the soviet union is no more but for now i highly recommend this film stars

0,this review is more about the hi md concept in general than one particular player the sound quality was excellent the rest of the product and concept deserves to die in the marketplace complaints the only thing that isn t proprietary is the headphone jack and the aa battery beyond that sony s dual role as a content provider complete with nasty intellectual property lawyers and equipment manufacturer fatally compromises usuability of this line of players no macintosh support is just the beginning proprietary compression algorithms weird and twisted upload download rules wrong choices made at every point of the prd process recording speed make that on a good day speed is a specification that should attract the attention of elliot spitzer if he only cared the players are flimsy just walking with mine caused it to skip and one hard fall to the floor and it stopped working entirely sony will charge you to honor the warranty parts only no labor by contrast apple replaced my daughter s ipod no questions asked when it started developing hard disk hiccups trying to find hi mds offers the thrill of the hunt if you re into that kind of thing but their rarity suggests that sony is at best half hearted about supporting this device i used to be a loyal sony customer but now believe they have gone almost irretrievably downhill sleek designs do not compensate for disfunctional product management and shoddy manufacturing in fact i m planning an hd tv purchase next year and have sony far down on the list of possibilities you can find better quality and value almost anywhere else these days howard are you listening

0,flynn offers up a fast paced if unbelievable story unfortunately character development is paper thin and clearly portrays flynn s political preferences characters like rapp with a military background are guided by clearly defined ethical principles have all the answers and are always showing those good for nothing politicians how the real world works meanwhile flynn s politicians the majority of whom are democrats seem only concerned with public opinion and the next election while there are grains of truth in his characters flynn consistently goes for the cheap partisan stereotype i was looking for a well developed political military thriller i m still looking
1,eventually anyone who makes it their business to seek out quality horror movies is going to come to the conclusion that the ones that succeed in distinguishing themselves from the pack tend to fall into three distinct categories first you have the horror movies that are less interested in scaring you than they are seriously exploring their subject matter and probing into the nature of evil sometimes they go the supernatural route the exorcist rosemary s baby don t look now sometimes they stay grounded psycho henry portrait of a serial killer either way they are more disturbing than they are immediately frightening you acknowledge that what you ve seen has struck a kind of nerve but you won t lose much sleep these movies are intellectually compelling but they do not provoke any immediate sense of terror on the other hand the second breed of quality horror movies has no interest in psychology in the nature of their content and do not attempt to intellectually engage you they only want to make you feel as if you are in immediate danger the movies that fall into this category halloween alien do not provide food for thought but they know how to make you uncomfortable and they know how to push your buttons they are manipulative in the extreme but they are actively frightening and provide visceral experiences that the previous category of horror films cannot finally the third category of superlative horror films distinguish themselves by remaining conscious of themselves they want to frighten you but they also want to convince you that they are above merely pushing your buttons at the same time they don t want to go the intellectual route either these films scream dawn of the dead are made by people who know the genre know that the audience knows the genre and toe a thin line between adhering to genre conventions and examining those conventions explicitly these films are very effective even if they are too cool for the room you laugh knowingly and then bam something truly frightening wipes that smirk right off your face bernard rose s candyman is a rarity in that it falls into all three of these categories it is intellectually stimulating and it knows a great deal about the nature of evil but it is also truly viscerally frightening it is self aware and yet it is not too cool for the room and there is no comfortable distance to be found from the nightmare that unfolds on the screen it is as immediately frightening as the orginal halloween it is as thought provoking as the exorcist and it is as aware as itself as the scream trilogy you ve never seen anything quite like it before and you probably won t see anything like it again the plot of candyman centers around a woman who is as much of an agnostic when it comes to the intangible world as one could imagine she boldly pursues strides into the haunts of a malevolent spiritual force the cabrini green housing projects in chicago which are dangerous enough without factoring evil spirits into the equation in search of discovering the source of the legend of the candyman a man with a hook for an arm who can be summoned by repeating his name into a mirror five times she is convinced as any liberal pseudo sociologist might be that the candyman is but a projection of the fears the urban poor have of gang drug related violence the fact that there is a gang leader who has taken to calling himself the candyman reinforces this conviction for this woman the idea that there is evil in the world pure evil unconditioned by economic racial most of the residents of cabrini green are poor and black factors is unthinkable she does not believe that the candyman is anything more than an idea she is wrong the candyman is real and he doesn t much like the challenge to his authority posed by her skepticism furthermore she reminds him of someone from his past whom he wishes to be reunited with and thus he comes to view her as a conquest on more levels than one for about half of the film we follow the woman played by virginia madsen and her friend played by kasi lemmons as they trek through cabrini exchange notes and conduct the affairs of their lives madsen s grad student is no different from a lot of young people she is determined to make a mark on her field she s a little suspicious about her husband s fidelity she smokes she s pretty she s intelligent and she seems nice enough she draws our sympathy however midway through the film there is a decisive rupture and everything in madsen s life begins to unravel at an alarming rate the chain of events that follow a particularly frightening scene in a parking lot take on the logic of a nightmare that one is unable to escape from soon everything we have come to know about the young woman we ve been following all of the connections she has to her friends to her husband to humanity in general seem to be undone it would be unfair to describe exactly what happens but let it be said that the final fifty minutes of candyman are as frightening as anything i ve seen on film we thought we were safe after all the character we d been following had friends family a job a life of her own the possibility of coming into conflict with nothing less than pure evil was the farthest thing from her mind she and her friend were more concerned about packing the requisite mace for their journey through the projects more afraid of drug dealers than of demons after all the candyman is an urban legend and we know all about urban legends they re campfire stories there is no boogeyman not really rose plays on the self conscious approach we take to horror films by decisively arguing that it will not save us he engages us intellectually by toying with the idea of whether the candyman is literally real or only becomes literally real if enough people are afraid of him i ll leave that up to you to decide and he frightens us at an immediate level by pulling the rug out from under us at a crucial moment and by never allowing us to regain our footing it doesn t hurt that he has an uncanny eye for frightening visuals the bees swallowing the chicago skyline the candyman s self portrait plus the help of a terrific soundtrack from philip glass whose presence reminds us that hey this is a serious piece of art and compelling performances on all levels not to mention a great idea and yes the ability to push our buttons and manipulate us when he wants to candyman is as far as i m concerned the second most frightening film ever made the original halloween still remains the only movie that made me briefly fear for my own safety but i would argue that the horror genre has produced no more complete work of art no other film that engages the viewer on every conceivable level they could ask to be engaged on than rose s masterpiece halloween becomes exponentially less scary with repeated viewings as you begin to get the sequence down and figure out what s coming candyman s power remains undiminished even once you get the sequence down because the scares give way to the ideas don t miss it rated r contains some very graphic gore nothing that will really surprise those used to the genre but this movie does get pretty ugly by any standard seriously who said this wasn t gory enough some language and brief nudity not in a sexual context
1,best hair dryer ever i have long thick curly frizzy hair and after just drying my hair for less then minutes with the conair my hair is shiny and soft the diffuser is also amazing i can wear my hair naturally without any frizz by far the best dryer out there in this price range granted it s heavy but it cuts my drying time in half and i don t have to style after drying which is another plus it has a warm heat setting which is awesome and what could make it prettier than the rhinestones

1,i am thilled to see this book being available in hardcover and paperback as well i read this book about ten years ago and i read it regularly every couple of years the story is very compelling and the scene of the protagonist walking home through a run down community is a classic of american literature what this book and o connor s other novel the last hurrah apart is the writing in an era where writers seem to challenge one another to be more like faukner and less comprehensible to the average man o connor wrote very well and his language is beautiful from this fine prose arises really deep characters which are flawed and so easily identifiable to us all

0,this bag is so cheap looking i am embarrassed to use it when i saw it online it looked identical to a us luggage bag i bought at tj maxx which was stolen so i was very excited to find what i thought was the same bag on amazon to replace it when i got it i was shocked at how cheap it looks the handles especially are plastic leather and just hideous the return policy through ebags is such a hassle that i am just going to keep it and use it for bringing my laptop to and from work but i will still need to find a better travel laptop bag i m very disappointed if you re looking for a professional looking laptop bag this isn t it i should have known better for the price but like i said i thought it was the same as the other us luggage bag i had which was gorgeous and i loved it oh well

0,i keep this frame on all day and night the lcd backlight should last longer than months but mine just burned out the quality of the pictures are okay if viewed from a distance but the low res is not good if viewing up close there is no external power controls or a remote so turning this unit on and off is a drag regular lcd backlights should last a few years even if it stays on all day and night this one just lasted months so the image is almost non existant now in the glare you can barely make out the image so it s still there but with no backlight so good as dead i would recommend a more expensive philips ones my friend has had it for about two years and it s still going plus it s higher res and and has more controls such as a timer function and also can play video clips which this one can t
0,what does wild things have going against it from the get go a no denise richards b no name actors c being a crappy direct to video sequel d no denise richards naked what is wrong with wild things after the fact a a script that tries to overcompensate its idiocy with more twists than a corkscrew b one sex scene a weak threesome one of the few things even linking this to the original c sexy actresses who star in a sexy movie but decide not to be naked leaving us with a body double and naked from behind shot wait let me play that again if i seem to be dwelling a little too much on the sexuality aspects of this film maybe its because this is an erotic thriller did i mention no denise richards

1,just today i randomly selected a movie that movie was henry i had never heard of it before and i figured that i was in for your average run of the mill low budget slasher flick though it is low budget it is by no means your ordinary serial killer movie in fact the gritty film and minimalist effects only adds to the stark realism of this nightmarish character study meet henry a very quiet and serene man with vacant and staring eyes as well as a calm disposition watch as he goes to work watch as he hits the bar with his buddy otis and watch as he calmly and systematically butchers random people this film does not exploit the violence though it is very frank and direct treating it as though henry were doing nothing more than cleaning the dishes or taking a stroll in the park this movie is a lot of things and when it was all over i just had to sit back and take a few breaths have a cigarette and try to gauge my reaction s i was surprised to note that while this film is disturbing it is also pretty funny in some parts though only funny in the blackest sense of the term there is no social commentary in this movie nor does it provide any closure the dvd is great awesome extras including fragmented interviews with the genuine serial killer henry lee lucas awaiting lethal injection on death row very fascinating
1,beginning with the introduction i was taken on a fabulous journey these gifted authors write a wonderful narrative lande s snapshots add a lot to this impressive and comprehensive companion they are as engaging as any short story in the new yorker i found the collection of old posters designer appealing integrated with beautiful photography as one would expect from national geographic the guide is uniquely for both armchair and active travelers and two books in one the first carefully expertly evaluates top ten lists on everything travel related from hotels to hideaways national parks to international markets subjective of course we all have our favorites i particularly liked a chapter called ten best things to do on sunday afternoons in ten cities part two includes literary and historical journeys elevating this travel guide above all others ready made and travel ready i m on my way on the road to mandalay the book ends at lands end with a country by country supplement to best destinations what a travel kit national geographic s ten best of everything is passport perfect in every way you ll love every moment
0,my cd player has jammed in a similar fashion to those described above i called the harman kardon customer service line and they kept me on hold for ten minutes then i went to their website which is poorly designed and slow to load due to an overabundance of flash graphics the website told me to fax a warranty replacement form to harman i had to do that three times to get a response finally i got a return authorization after two days and several emails poor quality poor customer support guess what h k i won t be buying any of your products in the future this is a replacement for a sony changer that worked flawlessly for years and i may take hk to small claims court if the replacement doesn t work
1,i have twin boys that are and i love this chair it doesn t have a lid or removable splash gurad i have two other sets of chairs that the twins only play with putting the lids up and down taking out the removable seat and catch basin etc this simply constructed unit has no corners or edges it has smooth contours including the splash guard that does not come off and is attached to the catch basin the catch basin is a combination seat emptying pail which enables you to easily remove and empty it is easily cleaned and because of the simple design less appealing to play with i think the best feature is the smooth built in splash guard which you need with boys this seat does not convert to a toilet seat for the bathroom toilet which i think doesn t work anyway on the other potty chairs i purchased the seats slide and flop when you put it on the real toilet and then becomes unsafe i recommend the babybjorn toilet trainer for that

1,when i was in the sixth grade we moved twice and in all three of the schools from new jersey to connecticut to japan i got to study ancient greece in the history part of the class i also got a lot of mileage out of having read edith hamilton s mythology i still have my mythology report with my versions of all of the illustrations but in all the times i got to study ancient greece before during and after the sixth grade i never got to do any of the fun stuff that avery hart paul mantell come up with for ancient greece hands on activities to experience this wondrous age this kaleidoscope kids volume for kids ages not only offers activities but also a variety of information about the ancient greeks so this is not simply a book of activities that teachers can pick and choose from to give their students hands on experiences it is also a source of facts and stories that will supplement what exists in whatever textbook is being used throughout the book there are great greeks and things to think about after reminding young readers of the gifts that have come down to us from ancient greece hart and mantell get students acclimated to the idea of looking at the past from the perspective of those who lived way back when then the book looks at key periods of greek history meet the minoans the pre greeks of crete looks at the culture that gave rise to the greatness of greece with activities to make a greek yo yo a great mother figure a hamster labyrinth without the minotaur and a fantastic fresco that gives you an indication of the sort of activities to be found in this book before we even get to greece itself other chapters are devoted to the age of heroes where you get a super short version of the iliad and can build a trojan horse language unites including speaking pig greek the dawn of a golden age where you can organize a pentathlon and make a victory wreath and ye gods greek religion and mythology where you can design your own constellation in the last part of the book chapters cover classical athens the flower of ancient civilization where you get to build a greek temple with ionic columns or even build the entire parthenon think for yourself philosophy where students can make a monochord or hold a symposium and the amazing arts which covers create sculptures and painting pots in the first part and making masks to make up a greek play in the second part the final chapter covers a wider world alexander the great and the hellenistic age where you can start a library at the end students can appreciate how being a greek meant standing in the center of the world as least as far as the ancient greeks were concerned again there are some key issues to be discussed to go along with the activities students can debate what is the difference between a hero and a celebrity understand why every vote counts in a democracy and decide what makes somebody beautiful learning how to press olives or how huge blocks of marble were transported across the sea gives students an appreciation for how things were different way back when throughout the book hart and mantell show how ancient ideas live on in modern traditions which remains the biggest legacy of the ancient greeks i teach classical greek roman mythology not to be confused with modern greek roman mythology apparently but i teach it online so i do not really have any opportunities to have my students engage in hands on activities but that does not mean i cannot do them in the privacy of my own home or that elementary school teachers will not find these extremely useful for their unit on ancient greece although i am suddenly reminded of coming up with the sparthens a k a the warriors with the brains in elementary school but that is another story

0,the idea was great and i did enjoy the warm lotion however i used it three times and put it back in the box the on off switch is located on the top of the dispenser and each and every time i turned it off lotion squirted everywhere making a huge mess and if you leave it on all the time the lotion gets hard and dries out would love to recommend it but i just can t i use lotion a couple of times a day due to dry skin and thought this would be a great item for me it just didnt measure up

1,this has to be one of the most beautiful cds ever recorded damien s vocal range is vast his musicianship excellent but it s the crafting of songs at which he truly surpasses most artists haunting sensitive flowing crashing if i have one criticism it s the mixing levels at times his vocals are drowned in concert when he lets rip you really feel the power of his vocals music which unfortunately doesn t come over quite as well on the album a truly magical album

0,wasted hours trying unsuccessfully to install the driver for the iogear port usb card on a dell optiplex gx running this computer already has usb ports the main problem is that the add hardware wizard does not find a inf file in the iogear supplied cd folder and does not recognize the executable program that is in the cd folder user has to cancel out of the wizard and execute the driver installation file as a stand alone program this results in installation of drivers that show up in the device manager however the installation wizard comes up at every subsequent reboot and the user must cancel out of it just to get the computer going installed card seemed to work ok for a d link wireless adapter but did not recognize a digital camera that was satisfactorily recognized by one of the non iogear ports the following actions did not help swapping the card to another pci slot downloading and installing more recent driver file from iogear website three calls to customer support where i found sympathy but so solution

0,this piece is really quite over priced for what you get though not having the knife allows you to bring this on a plane with you i ve seen this unit marketed elsewhere as a travel friendly swiss army tool not knife nevertheless the unit i have is the version of asin which costs considerably less on amazon has the same usb drive and red light as the unit on this page plus you get a small quantity of swiss army tools including a knife unless you are concerned about going on a plane i d recommend the asin over the unit on this page btw i got my handy little unit which i d give four stars for if i had the option for only on clearance at target

0,despite the fact that hanegraaff s name is the bigger of the two on the front cover only the first pages of this very small book are worth reading and they are the writing of paul maier his research is helpful but so limited in scope that you wonder if he wasn t given a week end to write it and come up with as much as he could every topic needs futher information a lot more could be said and maier seems to be the kind of scholar who could have done a lot more hanegraaff contributes pages of defense of the historical jesus which is an even more surface level reworking of information covered much better elsewhere that said i would give this book to someone who isn t much of a reader but for whom the da vinci code has raised some questions it isn t much more than a collection of scattered soundbites but that may have been a good marketing strategy when there is already such a proliferation of secondary literature on what was only a piece of pulp fiction
1,let me preface this review by stating that if i had to do this minute workout in its entirety i d probably never reach for it it s just too long but in its dvd format karen voight has thoughtfully provided a menu that has made this otherwise excellent program usable and doable it s set up so that you can follow it in logical sections and best of all you can completely skip the squat sequence and just do the amazingly thorough floor workout which is terrific for those like me who suffer from knee problems which prevent us from performing squats and lunges i am able to successfully break this whole program down into warmup arms abs cooldown stretch mondays and thursdays and warmup floor legs cooldown stretch on tuesdays and fridays and each intense workout is about minutes music and clothing especially the men s outfits are dated but i can get over it though i m sure there are others who cannot broken into shorter segments i rate this stars which i round up to

0,before i saw this movie i thought i would enjoy it i enjoyed watching the miniseries when i was a kid however nothing could prepare me for what i was about to watch on screen it was an absolute disaster of a film i do enjoy superhero movies some recent ones i like are the spiderman series and batman but the hulk did not inspire me at all it was like going to the dentist to get a tooth pulled the character is a cartoon like green figure totally lacking in his emotional capacities not even his rage convinced me it looked like a video game more than a movie this film had no serious plot worthy of mention it was just plain painful to watch if i could give it half a star i would
0,this software now constantly tries to get you to upgrade to a better package the schedule c for small business i used to like turbotax but it has really gotten to be a pain and finally i spent two days trying to e file always getting a server busy message from intuit this is after they got my credit card number and to file the fed and state tax returns so i had to hand assemble the return and make the trip to the post office intuit lobbied the gov to let them keep this big plum and then screwed it up they had this same problem last year and it is worse this year time to call all our representatives and get e file free from the irs it saves the irs money far more than it costs why is intuit allowed to suck this much more from us after making big profits on the package

0,i got norton ghost with my new dell pc so i thought i would use it for backups to an external usb drive after about months of trying to use it i finally gave up and uninstalled it reason most of the backups somehow get corrupted and the software seems to have trouble working with it twice i removed all the partial backups and started from scratch but again after a few weeks the backup agent would hang while doing an incremental backup now the software is good for making a complete clone of the hard disk or restoring system from an image but it does not seem to work well with incremental backups

1,if you liked the first disgaea you will just love the second one the game builds upon all the strong points of the previous game now instead of taking forever to get powerful characters you can achieve characters like the archer ninja etc much quicker the main characters are still hilarious and i love the fact that you get to see laharl etna and the gang again in this one go prism rangers once again the plot isn t too twisted but it is enjoyable back to the game play though its similar to the old one but you have more options for one you can join the dark assembly in the item world you can not only level your item but go to an assembly improve the luck of your item and purchase items such as alcohol and bombs to influence the assembly there is also the new addition of the subpoena these are felony charges that your characters receive based upon too many murders too much hp etc etc these are medals of honor in the demon world and allow your characters more prestige not to mention they once again make you want to go to the item world another bonus you can transfer the bailiff for your subpoena onto your item so you can get a felony charge and level your item at the same time this game is a fabulous addition to any gamer s collection and i highly recommend it enjoy
1,if you are even remotely familiar with home design or cad software then this is your product assuming you can t deal with the price or steep learning curve of chief architect base chief architect ca is the holy grail of powerful yet intuitive home design software but it s not cheap and it s not for beginners it is really aimed at pro s not home enthusiasts most home enthusiasts would be far better off with punch but if you have a brain some patience and like a challenge and want the best go with ca punch is the best product on the market in the sub price point easily beating out products like cadsoft envisioneer the cost in my opinion cadsoft envisioneer has no market if you are going to spend on pro software get chief architect for more if you don t need that much power that ca has ie you aren t an engineer or architect drawing formal construction blueprints than buy punch for less than envisioneer envisioneer is a product priced in no mans land it s a suckers buy back to the product at hand first punch isn t as easy to pick up for a neophyte ie complete computer design newbie as say home architect or better homes gardens both of which were spawned from the same code base but it is much more fully featured faster and much more powerful and less buggy it s ui is more standard and intuitive to windows software guru s and it s renderer blows away the competition not only in speed but quality it renders stunning scenes which blow away the competition visually at to the time plus punch recently and quietly acquired from riverdeep encore to supplement thier bottom end sub market in other words punch considers to be the bottom feeder and not real competition against thier product for which they are correct and it s derivatives are junk compared to punch every few years i review them all and punch has been on top for a while not just in features not just in speed not just in reliability stability but across the board toptenreviews recently gave punch the spot as they deserve punch has also been the top selling home enthusiast design software for the last years running it s not by accident it s because it is the best hands down users should seriously consider jumping ship to punch now that they own it the only reason to consider over punch is if you are a total clueless newbie once you are no longer a totally clueless newbie it s time to move to a serious program like punch even if you have a lot of content it doesn t mean you shouldn t start moving over to punch you can continue to use both until punch has a solid importer this recent acquisition means that punch owns of the home design software market for home enthusiasts this is estimated to be a million market and punch pretty much has it owned since punch considers to be the bottom feeder don t count on the title or code base to be drastically improved in the future in fact if i had to gues i would bet that over time the existing code base will be scrapped by punch and replaced with it s own code base w some of the power tools stripped in short if you are a professional who knows their way around cad and want the best for home design despite the cost get chief architect base or full it s learning curve is steep but nothing beats it if you are a home enthusiast who has a clue around cad or home design software then this punch as is your choice end of story buy it if you are a complete newbie and have never used home design or cad software before i recommend buying the cheapest or special edition you can find here on amazon for only it s very limited but will serve it s purpose go through the tutorials learn how to use it play with it until you know what is going on design something simple this way it costs you only to leverage all of the tuts included in and come up to speed with the terminology and concept of home design then toss it and buy punch as to do your real work it takes a real program to do real work p rhino

0,very politically manipulative primer that only gives of the story i add because the author does acknowlege some of the huge problems caused by unbridled global capitalism but then quickly glosses them over basically saying that these effects are unfortunate but that free global trade is best for everyone in the long run there is a lot of interesting incidental information as various terms are explained but too often this reference becomes a one sided sermon for free trade these are the same deceptions that robert reich started pushing under clinton repubs kept the song going without missing a beat most of both dem and repub reps support neoliberal policies the rich get richer in both parties feel free to read to learn about terms just be aware that the author is leading you down a highly biased path

1,the watch is solar powered and time is synchronized with an atomic clock i m not sure how that works radio waves but the watch is extremely accurate the watch charges easily put it under a light when you take it off and it has a powersaving feature that kicks in when there is no light source i e it s dark the buttons settings work similarly to a battery powered g shock but there is a little more complexity because you have to set your home city for the atomic clock sync to work right it s the first casio i ve owned with a metal band unless you re a gorilla you ll need to remove some links from the watch band i did this myself but you may want to take it to a jewelry store cause they have the right tools i love the watch it is everything you would expect from a g shock

0,i want to believe all of the positive reviews i really do but at the moment i m still having problems with the downloading and uploading of the firmware i know i know do it in recovery mode whatever that is don t worry i ve been to the site and followed the directions times and as for customer support i got a message giving hours and good bye i did called during the hours cs was supposedly open i had a mpio and wanted something more reliable but once again find the software package and manual so big and so little information are not intuitive or easy to use maybe the mac nation is right and as for that first review posted here on amazon com i hope that guy got a bonus he must be working for cowan don
1,this makes a great cake or cupcakes i used a modification to make it a chocolate cake it was a hit and also baked them in little bear molds the kids loved them i have little grandgirls and a daughter who are celiac and these mixes are the best thing to have in the house no one non celiac can tell the difference
1,this is the only music magazine you ever need to read this is what rolling stone should aspire to be there is really nothing more to say than if you like music this is all there is
0,amendment to below review mar my wife really likes them and wears them all the time i d upgrade at least one more star maybe two if i could my son wanted to buy mama s present this christmas so naturally we turned to amazon for computer skill training and the ability to view a lot of products easily the earrings arrived today very quickly but the stone is not nearly as robust as the picture depicts the stone is white like a fake diamond when viewed in other kinds of light you can see a slight tint of blue but nothing like the picture another issue the clasp or ear stud is flimsy i may return them need to ask my son but i don t think these earrings will last more than a couple of wears on the positive side it really is a nice design
1,i just got mine from amazon after a lengthly delay it is an awesome memory card it comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras i tested it on the camera and it worked great the real test was the compatibility with the sony psp no issues there the card worked flawlessly i ve already used up mb its a must buy plus at its much less than other retailers btw i ordered it at then contacted amazon about the price drop they credited the difference to me without any hassle and gave me the one day shipping at no charge because of the delay overall great service too
0,i thought these would be slightly sour like dried cherries i have enjoyed in the past no hfcs is high fructose corn syrup so these taste strangely sweet like weird raisins they are ok if i cook them in oatmeal or if i m really hungry but i wouldn t buy them again if you are looking for tart dried cherries look elsewhere
0,after reading her excellent halloween book i figured her halloween cd would be worth owning i always search for different halloween cds but this was filled with the same old stuff chains moans and spooky laughs then more chains moans and spooky laughs very dissapointing
1,my husband is in love with this razor he thought he was a norelco only fan until i bought him this model for christmas i purchased it due to the great reviews it received both from consumers and independent reviewers and also b c it cost less than it leaves his face so smooth whether he shaves daily or skips a couple of days in fact he can finally shave the hairs on his upper neck without getting razor burn highly recommended
1,i bought this rechargeable shaving system for my husband for christmas it was a replacement of a corded shaver he had been using he has been enjoying the features offered by this device he especially likes the ability to rinse it out after each use it gives a close shave and has a quick charge feature that allows you to charge it for a few minutes and gives at least two shaves he has used the razor for about two weeks now with no complaints it was a great price for a quality product
1,go read the review i wrote on the shampoo the same goes for this product cheaper at qvc then amazon like all the other or so products i have shopped around for in the last months go back into the stores people you will find prices cheaper than at amazon
1,microsoft office pro edition is a good product it installed easily over office pro i haven t had any problems with it yet it relies heavily on online links you probably should have a fast dsl connection or broadband if you are going to use the online links update i am using windows xp with office pro and today was disappointed to find that the help menu is not as user friendly or helpful as earlier editions
0,my husband and i recieved this as a baby shower gift and were initially really excited about it until we started using it and realized that the motor and other mechanisms that keep the fish moving and lights going are very noisy the noise the toy makes running is lounder than any of the music to sooth baby we were greatly disappointed
0,i thought these wipes would be a handy solution for the office or situations where i don t want to carry around a bottle and a microfiber cloth but contrary to what s promised on the package the wipes left big watermarks on lenses which ended up dirtier than they started the wipes work okay on a computer screen though
1,i honestly hate fighting games i think they re boring and they don t offer anything interesting to keep me attached to them as the years go by enter tekken tekken has been around for many years when it first came out everyone loved it it used to compete with virtua fighter on the sega saturn i was impressed then and i m impressed now all these years later the action is just a lot of fun you really couldn t ask for a better fighting game the graphic updates have really added more depth to the characters and the environments i love the game and i hope you do as well
0,i got this item for my coffee loving truck driver husband when we took it out of the box we saw the obvious problem the mug is tiny only a bit larger than an espresso cup to add insult to injury it took way too long to brew for such a small cup now it s back in the box collecting dust and we re sorry we wasted our hard earned money
1,i have tried the gerber nursing pads and one other brand these nursing pads are the best i have a large supply of milk but i have not leaked through these pads they are also very soft and they are not visible through your clothing
1,super comfortable provides great support coverage love the front zipper no fighting to get over your head
0,some of these reviews are amazing seems rather professional to me in most cases these are just brine shrimp people feeder shrimp for most fish you want to learn how to keep a pet buy one you want to learn how to grow food for it to feed off of then this is the starter kit it s not a pet it s a food
1,this battery has much better life than the battery that come with the q i would say you can do twice as much talking surfing texting etc while charging it about as often there are higher mah batteries available for the q but they cost so for or so this is a pretty good deal the only downside and maybe i just didn t read description well enough is that the battery door is silver which looks dorky on my black q
1,the car seat itself is awesome but the condition it arrived in was awful the box was smashed and caved in and it had been exposed to rain or moisture of some kind there was nothing covering the seat like a plastic bag so debris had gotten into the box and soiled the material on the seat it was a gift for my grandson for christmas so i didn t have time to return it and hope for a timely return it took alot of time and effort to clean the spots off the seat simply packing the seat with a plastic bag over it would have made alot more sense to me
1,learn catalan is a fun activity and a good learning experience for those with no spanish base however i have taken about years of spanish and found the cd to be fairly basic and while catalan differs in many ways many of the things they teach are not as useful as i would hope there are a lot of items and phrases neccessary to be a tourist i definitely have benefitted from this cd because i can hear the way the language is pronounced and become more absorbed in it overall great for beginners and only slightly helpful for someone with spanish knowledge
1,my son loves the jersey a little pricey but a nice jerse
0,this kit is just junk the deluxe blower brush is a cheap plastic blower in the tiniest size there is a tweezers that is just folded aluminum sheet metal there s no way that is getting anywhere near my cameras there are a few sheets of lense tissue and a few swabs to use with the cleaning solution the lintless cleaning cloth is an about x piece of something akin to reusable paper towels that you ll use about three times and then throw away this kit is not worth buying at any price because it s not worth the shipping charges
1,for the price you get a lot out of this camera zoom stabilized the images comes out great at full zoom stabilization mode the aid of a histogram will tell you the right exposure to set for your picture the multiple program modes just about lets you take a great picture under different situation controls are easy to use and get to in all definitely a great buy for the price the down side is that movie mode has no sound but if that is a factor then get the dmc or a camcorder
1,this case is vital to protect the lightweight which could be easily damaged from a drop the case does not detract from the convenience of the it adds virtualy no bulk to the camera so that it still slips in a pocket or a purse easily
0,this album is not what i call a album first trackz are the tightest with the tightest beats best track on here is i practice looking hard probably one of the best trackz he eva made in his whole career i love that song but otha than that captain save a hoe and mail man are a discrace he shouldnt have even made this cd until he got more track

1,i had heard of how amazing final fantasy vi was supposed to be so i thought i have to get this game even if to just fill out my final fantasy collection first off i will start with v i had heard from many sources that this game wasn t very good i in fact find it just as good as vi vi is just as good as i was expecting it s funny and has very memorable characters and dialog my only problem with the two games is that there is a bit of a lag the lag is not bad at all in v but is pretty noticable in vi while it was a minor inconvience to me most people may find it more irritating don t get me wrong i don t think the lag is enough to actually mess you up but it can get a little annoying overall i got two great games for the price of one bargain game i must say i am completely satisfied
1,i have had other apc battery backup s in the past and the only negative comment about the product is the size and space required for the unit given our power failures brown out and the high wind and storms in our area the apc does an excellent job i have not only my desktop pc but my scanner printer and digital camera on the system and it has saved my equipment numerous time for the power surges and failures
1,this sparkling juice really holds up to the description it has the perfect amount of carbonation not too much not too little is crisp to the taste and is very refreshing the oz cans sounded pretty weak but it turns out that one can is the perfect amount for a sitting since first tasting martinelli s sparkling apple cider at a new year s celebration over a decade ago i ve been a huge fan of carbonated apple drinks but none have been just right naturally i ve tasted the types that i ve come across over the years including martinelli s sparking cider which is kind of sweet tasting and not generally bottled for everyday consumption martinelli s sparkling apple juice a bit under carbonated apple beer non alcoholic good but has a slightly odd taste appletiser uk only good but uk only and a few other local organic brands all of the aforementioned beverages are good on occasion but seriously none compare to essn s sparkling fuji apple juice yeah it is a little pricey but its worth it
1,i have been impressed by tazo s china green tips tea strong is an understatement great tea i have throughly enjoyed i
1,i am pleased with the watch it is flashy and keeps good time however i am still trying to figure out why it stops from time to time i think i inadvertantly push a button that stops it it is a small annoyance but has happened times in the last month
1,i ve used on two cars of mine that had scratches i ve noticed it will permanently remove or greatly improve nearly all minor to medium scratches it really depends on the scratch and how deep it is it works like magic on some scratches and dramatically improves most other mild to medium grade scratches it works alot like a car wax as far as application removal you have to buff it off with a cloth and it will have a brilliant shine the only reason i don t give it stars is it doesn t completly remove all scratches
0,i originally planned to purchase locin floss to replace the dentek but i m not too pleased with it so far pluses each individually wrapped floss doesn t contain floride minuses flimpsy handle almost not usable wrap is not sealed flossing head is shallower and narrower than the dentek
1,i love these shoes they are totally cute the only draw back is they are kinda like satin over paper they aren t as soft as i thought they would be but i great buy none the less
0,i bought usher s on tape long ago and i remember liking it then a couple of years ago i bought it again on cd listened to it and wondered why i wasted my money maybe it s the fact that i ve grown but this album sounds so un soulful now it is just lacking any spirit sort of like an over produced record all studio magic but no magic from the singer even the songs that are supposed to sound heartfelt don t the album sounds dated not transcendent of time and era like all the albums that become classics the songs are very forgettable and i don t see any of them being seen as classics twenty years from now usher has yet to make a masterpiece addendum i was a little unfair in my rating the album deserves stars not unfortunately i can t change it
0,bought this to help myself achieve some punch with my existing waves all i got were crimps in wierd places found the instruction booklet completely not useful i tried and tried but could not produce anything remotely close to a wave curl etc save your money
0,the product promises good results but the instruction manual is very unfriendly and confusing and printed in such small fonts that one needs a magnifying glass to read it and a third hand to execute the steps that are indicated unfortunately as an average customer i have only two hands after several attempts i still have not been able to make the display light up permanently onto the ceiling i look forward to resolving that but the problem is that you need a combination of obscurity in the room to view the display on the ceiling but light on the instruction manual to read it
1,i like this album its got a nice mix of old and new material along with some live material great to see pe still at it in this ever changing rap game
0,it wasnt all that bad it had its moments brad renfro bully dominique swain face off keram malicki sanchez tv s buffy the vampire slayer emily bergl the rage carrie justin long jeepers creepers james king bulletproof monk and jordan bridges mona lisa smile son of jeff bridges star as camp counslers who have well a lot of problems peter stormare eight millimeter is the camp nazi and he doesnt want anything to go wrong in his camp emotions relationships and other crazy shtick happens along the way james king former model looks good dipping in that lake hmm renfro and swain are so wrong for each other they should be a couple in real life bergl is hot to the bone bridges is a bastard long is a hoot as a nerdy geek type of characer and sanchez is nicely cast as a kid who is not afraid to show his homosexuality to the others stomare is just weird plain weird and the kids are brats so if you liked heathers because daniel waters wrote it then this is the movie for yo
0,so this was my first digital camera got it last july for my birthday i go to a lot of concerts so i needed a camera that could take pictures in not good light and take pics of moving subjects well two days after i got it i was at a festivale watching my fav band perform and the the screen went white it would still take pics only you couldnt see them after changing the batteries and turnign it off and on it went back to normal alarmed i called samsung and they told me the couldnt do anythign until it was white again it only did it a couple of times after that so i never called again but that was only one thing wrong with it this is a horrible camera for concerts the pictures are always blurry shoot even when im at my house the pics still come out blurry sometimes tuesday i went to see my fav band again and the dumb thing goes white it woudnt stop no matter how many times i turned it off and on again now the flash is broke and i m ready to throw it against the wall you can t trust this camera you never know when it will take good pics or bad pics i wouldnt even consider buying this camera for a minute
0,i subscribed in late may to maximumpc and pcgamer early july i started getting pcgamer still nothing from maximumpc i called customer service and they said they had recieved my order june and to expect my first issue in late september thats nearly four months that is an unreasonable wait relative to the industry standard and clearly outside the stated wait on the order form i gave one star because the magazine is a good magazine but at a news stand price it is too expensive so i am left with the choice of spending almost to get the four months worth before my subscription starts more than the subscription itself or just missing out on those issue very poor customer service
1,my five year old wanted drums for christmas so my dad got her this she loves it and so do we it has volume control and you can use head phones with it it has good sound and so far isnt driving me nuts she hasn t had any of the problems other people described with thiers

0,the extendable arm breaks very easily i had two of them and they both broke within the first month the company does have a month warranty but you have to pay for shipping to send it back to them and i have been waiting over a month for my replacement very poor product do not buy
0,what should have been a fascinating book at the very least as a voyeuristic experience fails to deliver largely due to its poorly written pages the text stumbles along from incomprehensible link to allusive derailment making the mistake of huge chunks of repetitive material which inevitably detract from the fascinating subject matter perhaps more of an editng disaster than an author s failure at the heart of which lies a story deserving a more coherent telling
1,love the idea for these books perry mason nancy drew can t wait for the next one love the research that gets sprinkled in to make a fun book who s next mike hammer philip marlowe
1,this is my very first experience with a trimmer i was aiming to the plastic made products with the replaceable cutters but i recall my school had an old beat up trimmer and it seemed to still cut good so i went with the wooden type and self sharpening blade the quality is great it s very light to carry plus it cuts perfect
0,the concept for this game is strong and it s got some cute ideas but the voice recognition especially for the word blue and the character recognition is abysmal it makes the game an exercise in frustration more than anything else as to character recognition unless you write in whatever font the game is programmed to recognize it s going to record your answers as something different than what you wrote you are penalized when the system doesn t recognize blue or the correct number if the system is so rigid that it only accepts one way of saying blue then the system should have a sound file that tells you what it wants to hear as to the number recognition it should have a screen that shows you how the system wants the numbers written or it should be able to allow you to enter your numbers and correlate them to numbers within the system when i make this mark it also the intro content is absurdly long with no way to skip over it huge waste of time after the first you ve seen it i just got the game today and i ve spent hours trying to figure out a way to say blue such that the game will recognize it now i just wish i could return opened software i m very frustrated with the entire experience
1,my baby has used this since she was months old it has a sturdy wide base it has height adjusters you can recline it very secure safty belts but i do make sure my babies hands are nowhere near it when i buckle it thats the only thing i dislike about this highchair i dont find it hard to clean it comes with two trays and it has wheels and folds up definately worth the money especially now because it s on sale i paid full price
0,filmed in this movie is in black and white and might be considered dull and slow moving by today s standards an accurate chronology of the six wives of henry viii the characters of the wives are rather undeveloped and the movie does not delve very deeply into the important religious and political questions around which the marriages centered a good introduction for those who are unfamiliar with the basic story but the serious scholar will want to conduct further research
1,why the record company would put this out on vhs and not dvd is beyond me especially considering its release date the ultimate would be and they have done it before see both the doors and sepultura dvd releases to take this and add to it live at brixton and put it all on one dvd since this doesn t seem likely i suggest burn your own dvd and include not only ricochet and another bloody murder both left out but also mr bungle s one music video release happily while stripsearch is not listed on the back of the vhs box it is included fnm videos great great great
1,i m very happy with this case i was just looking for a simple belt carrier that would protect my treo but would allow complete access to the treo when i wanted to use it in other words i didn t want something that was attached to the treo permanently this did the trick it s simple but looks good seems to be solidly made as well
1,i borrowed this cd from a public library having liked the track crazy life on the empire records soundtrack and i was immediately blown away by how consistently good coil is the whole way through it is their most mature album full of gentle emotion and idealism and puts the listener in a good mood glen phillip s voice is unique confident and beautiful i fell in love immediately with rings and dam would break the haunting and beautiful harmonies captivate little buddha is so different but so good as well after i got coil i bought two of toad s older albums fear and dulcinea both are really good but something keeps drawing me back to coil it is achingly beautiful vibrant thoughtful and pleasurable it is hearing toad at their best
1,i ve owned this coin pouch for several months now and it has held up exceptionally well to repeated use proving to be an excellent and extremely durable holder for loose coins and eliminating the need to dig in one s pocket for spare change
1,a very good product but the fantastic part is sirius radio itself howard rules
0,don t get me wrong i really enjoy neal stephenson s books the historical content he winds into his plots is engaging however i have been working with the micro computer since before the command line neal you have the title wrong in the beginning was the monitor no doubts in my mind my right hand is still trained to enter octal codes on a keypad at lightening speed the command line came much later more like the coalescence of matter in the universe when clumps of useful things needed some impactful gravity the monitor was there before the clumps and after the octal toggle switches address load and register load momentary switches the monitor got the human fingers attached to the computer once and for all so stars because the title is just wrong
0,i am sorry to say that i thoroughly disliked of human bondage i know it is on every must read list for fiction which is why i decided to read it however i just wonder how such a boring story can continually be relegated to such a hallowed position in literature not only did i find it dull but i was becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the main character s perception of women i m not a feminist in the least but most of the female characters were described in such pathetic ways yellow teethed sallow skin dirty hands tear stained over powdered face it goes on and on i wondered if the author was uncomfortable women i looked online for some information about maugham to my surprise i found out that maugham was bisexual he did marry and have a child but for most of his life it sounded like he was involved with men in no way can i say this substantiates or confirms the tone of the book but in some way it answered my question or concern instead of this book i d recommend the following classics beautiful and damned by f scott fitzgerald madame bovary by flaubert at least in these books maybe the female characters are not the most virtuous but the characters are written with such sensuality that even though they might not be described as gorgeous they are brought to life in the pages by the author with a kaleidoscope of words that makes them multidimensional good or bad
1,i first picked up this book because i ve always been interested in what young writers have to say but i have to admit even i was a little surprised this story mind the mythicism is a real representation of what young children s minds sometimes go through that idea of a person you fabricated gaining more reality than necessary congrats to ms oyeyemi for her brilliant attempt to shine some light on this realm that few share conversations about she is one i ll keep in my mind for a while if you like young writers you should check out charles hedji s fields of discovery i m an avid reader once again
1,this product is excellent it will make it much easier on your back and also time efficient
1,my husband is away military and i was looking for the perfect small but clear pictures for him i didn t care about the frame only the small white digital system i was hesitant as my mil has a digital keychain and the picture quality is horrible i was pleasantly surprised at the picture quality and the ease of both looking at pictures already on an sd card and transferring pictures from the computer i love that i can use either batteries or the included plug everything was soooo easy that i did not even need to read the instructions to begin i also purchased the small case to put this in for travel as the album is just an added extra for later this is the best investment for anyone looking for something very small and portable perfect to send a military loved one lots of pictures to keep them involved no matter how far away they are then when he comes home it s great for a portable album to carry anywhere
1,the cable is exactly what i needed and was much more inexpensive than other alternatives drivers provided on the accompanying cd worked but were not as complete as i would have liked i am still very satisfied as it was only the cable that i was really after especially for the price at which i bought it
0,it was an awkward mess smushing gel over my teeth with a piece of flimsy plastic that barely adhered much less fit securely it d probably be easier without the trays i don t know if they work or not i gave up i want my crest whitestrips back
1,i purchased this a gift for a special friend as i know that she loves musicals and had this movie but only on video tape when she first opened the gift she could nothing but squeal with delight and run around the office showing everyone with much excitment she has watched the movie several times and invited other friends over to enjoy the experience i myself have watched the movie and must say it is enjoyable but not the best movie of this genre would only recommend for people who like broadway shows and musicals i m glad i got this movie as a gift for her as i will now be remembered for many years to come
0,i subscribed to this magazine in august and just received the september issue now budget travel s customer service is terrible i ve complained several times but am still missing the august october and november issues have asked for a refund but have yet to have my account credited
0,if you have had any exposure to good literature you will find this novel nearly insufferable the symbolism is cliche narrative style predictable and unoriginal and the book as a whole is this woman s self indulgent notion that the story of her family makes a good read if she had any creative ability she could use her family history as a starting point but she does very little to distinguish her writing as exciting and fresh dull dry predicatable callow and unfortuantly a requirement from a lit professor who has insulted my eight semesters as an english student
0,a serious snooze fest of course if you are a huge kim newman fan you ll be pleased literally every other story in the book is one if you must read this book check it out from the library at least that way you won t be wasting your money
1,we gave our nine yr old grandson this train for christmas he had a such a good time putting it together then running it on the track the train absolutely glides on the track so quietly and smoothly it is a great product
0,you will probably be more productive and less bug ridden if you stick with what you have don t expect to turn this version on and be able to use it many changes are literally imposed on you like the ribbons instead of the familiar icon bars missing menus and the auto double space setting every time you hit return there are new features which can be helpful to some but microsoft probably thinks you can afford a week for retraining the arrogance of microsoft not even to offer the menus everyone is used to as a classic or traditional option is incredible you upgrade for hundreds of dollars to get totally stuck and run out to buy a manual
0,these actually left my screen dirtier than i started with it left behind annoying streaks and film which i ultimately ended up having to clean off with my usual homemade solution i suggest keeping a soft cloth with some water and rubbing alcohol handy it s cheaper and more effective

1,great invention to those who don t want to be attached to an ipod and like an updated version of a juke box easy to use load unfortunately however it requires an receiving unit to broadcast the sound
0,clearly the tens of millions of fouls who read this racist crap fail to see it for exactly what is an endorsement of ethnic cleansing if the tables were turned and a jew or a muslim wrote a series in which anyone who disagreed with judaism or islam was brutally murdered than the same fundamentalists idiots who take such disgusting pleasure out of this garbage would go simply ape s t i do not know what is more pathetic the fact that there are actually fundamentalist lunatics out there who write this truly unforgivable racist garbage or the large number of dimwits out who eagerly wait to throw their money away on each installment of hateful filth
1,you have to be very careful how you apply this product the instructions state clearly to use only a small amount of the solution only then will it work if you use too much you will experience the oil and water effect the other rater stated otherwise this product works very well remember to reapply when you see the effects going away
0,this was my first and only purchase of a linksys product i unhappily discovered that it would not work with my multifunction printer then hooked it up to another printer only to have it die just out of warranty a completely worthless piece of chinese made technology that is so bad the manufacturer doesn t even stand behind it
1,i was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the items i ordered as well as receiving a discount coupon for my next order thanks
1,the legendary howard hawks directed this wwii classic about the mary ann a b bomber lead by captain john ridgely and featuring crew members gig young harey carey arthur kennedy charles drake george tobias ray montgomery and john garfield on a routine mission to hawaii the crew arrives just hours after the pearl harbor attack and find themselves thrust into war other stops include wake island and the philippines of course one of the purposes of this film was to rally the american spirit and it features some of the anti japanese dialogue you d have to expect but the film succeeds beyond the propaganda value the action sequences are well filmed and exciting with terrific aerial action and some good ground sequences too the camraderie amongst the crew is credible each member has his own small back story as you would expect but these fine character actors make it all very believable harry carey is a particular standout this film is a true wwii classic
0,an ok gadget but a large coffee cup with water heated in the microwave works just as well it does not have an automatic shut off so the water in the unit eventually evaporates leaving the exposed heating coil must unplug the unit after each use to prevent this
0,this camera takes blurry pictures straight out of the box one mistake i made was to not take my own sd card to the camera shop and look at the output i thought the blurry image i was seeing at the camera store was because of the low resolution screen but it really is the camera i ve missed too many pictures of my kids and am in the process of buying a new camera a short months after buying this casio support was responsive and tried to help but nothing appears to work and point and shoot is definately not an option i thought it would be nice to take quick pictures of the kids but none of them are worth keeping i ve taken over pictures and i will not print any of them
1,i have given this as a gift to both my husband and father in law they are both very handy and own older homes it is perfect i even enjoy reading my husbands for organizational tips
0,this was a present to myself for my birthday i thought i was purchasing a quality product two weeks after receiving the item it stopped working i took it to a certified jewler for battery replacement and a few days after that it stopped again i sent it back for a refund and not very happy i have to pay a restock fee for a defective item i will be rethinking future purchases
1,the lexar jumpdrive lightning flash drive has very impressive performance ratings of sec sustained read and sec sustained write speed capability this is one of the very few usb drives that lists the read write speed capabilities the reality of flash drives is that the smaller the file size the slower the transfer rate will be i ran some tests with the lightning to see what the transfer rate and the elapsed time is for groups of various file sizes medium files avg min sec large files avg seconds very large file seconds so even though the write speed capability of the lightning is the transfer rate drops to with medium size files which is fairly real world usage but don t let that dissuade you from considering the lightning the higher the speed capability of the device the better the transfer rate will be and the less time it will take to transfer those smaller files to prove this point i took one of my great deal cf cards that had no speed ratings that tops out at read write and ran two of the same tests medium files min sec large files min sec so compared to the lightning the great deal card took nearly times longer to write the medium files and times longer to write the large files so which is the better deal when you use the device over and over and over whether you are shopping for a card or a stick for digital cameras or a usb flash drive if the performance numbers are not specified beware what you might think is a great deal may get you a device with very poor performance that you will regret purchasing i know i have several in my drawer so my bottom line advice is look for the highest rated device you can find flash devices will last a looong time and our file sizes and amount of data will only grow so future proof your purchase by shopping for a high rated and large capacity for now and the future i have no relationship with lexar or the flash memory industry
0,i used herbalism for a few weeks after discovering lush products through a friend my face esp my forehead became very greasy and every pore on my forehead became inflamed i thought it was stress and continued using it until my next lush run when they gave me a sample of aquamarina my face cleared up instantly when the aquamarina ran out i went back to herbalism but surprise the skin problems reemerged now i m using aquamarina instead and love it though you can t get it through amazon for some reason check the lush website i m sure this won t happen to everyone but give that pink glop a try instead

1,working out used to be heh for me but after getting the door gym i made a rule anytime i enter my bathroom which is where it is suspended either before or after i have to do pull ups and neutral pull ups also since i purchased the broad reach of those as well it s working wonders within the first week of doing pull ups where i d use my legs just enough to complete the pull up i m now able to do regular pull ups i m very happy with this product only downside which i personally don t really care about is that depending on what kind of door frame you have you could get some denting on the front side the backside works just fine and leaves no marks on your walls so anyway i highly recommend this product to anyone who wants a quick and depending on how hard you want to work p easy workout
0,look the fact is feminism is about choice no more no less i have the highest respect for stay at home moms it is the hardest darn job on earth but this woman is way off base to say that feminism sold us a lie feminism gave us a choice it told us we did not have to pretend to believe we were june cleaver if that was not what was in our hearts and souls personally i could not have children and only feminists have not made me feel like an alien species i work with troubled teens my skills do not go to waste i spoil my nieces and nephews i am fulfilled and happy my sister is a stay at home mom with three beautiful boys she is fulfilled and happy feminism gave us those choices ladies we were not sold anything we were given much by the women who burned their bras before us if you feel belittled by staying home with your children and doing the world s most important job i think that is your issue and not now s stop blaming feminism for your insecurities if you are feminist stop blaming your mother for your insecurities you have choices because of feminism not despite it
1,even someone who isn t a dedicated hardcore fan of the halo series can appreciate the beautiful art and all the work that went into designing this game worth every penny
0,after reading the other reviews of this product i felt confident enough to go ahead and buy it as a gift for an year old boy he is learning multiplication tables now so i figured this was a great present unfortunately once the batteries were in it kept malfunctioning and when the dials were twisted to numbers it would read out two totally different numbers and give their result instead of the numbers the dials showed we tried over and over to get it to work but it is a dud i live overseas so returning it is not an option i am willing to pay the extra freight duty for i bought another leap frog product at the same time that i have not given as a present yet i really hope it works
0,this film is evocative of the quirky madcap robert altman at his best and worst we got it because we have a bud cort fan in the family and just to see him makes it worth it but the story is strange resolution less than satisfying if you re really a big altman or cort fan then you must see it just be aware that this is not a western i had it confused with john wayne s rooster cogburn and the dennis weaver s mccloud and kept waiting for it to start thinking i was seeing more previews the storyline combines an oddball who lives in unauthorized apartment in the basement of the astrodome who is trying to fly with a murder mystery and detective story this is one of shelly duvall s early roles don t miss her upside down false eyelashes
1,my husband and his friend likes to hike and one day he and his friend met some people out of state they wanted to share email address no one had a pen pencil so my husband s friend pulls out his pocket knife and inside it is a pen to write with everyone was so excited to know there is a swiss army signature with a pen to write with inside my husband looked everyone where in stores for this same knife set cause he wanted one just like it could not find it so i did some searching on the net and bought it for his christmas gift he was so excited to receive it on christmas morning thanks
1,every thing he sings is perfect i ve yet to find one song that doesn t move me this cd has some beauties daughter of mine is priceless steal away is very nice one small star brings tears this arrangement of voyage is probably the best i ve heard his traditional songs when you and i were young maggie and mary of argyle are beautiful i can t find anything on this cd i couldn t listen to for hours i truly love music and listen to it constantly i find myself reaching for the mcdermott cd s almost exclusively i have them all more please
0,p s has potential both grace and linney are great in it but midway through the movie loses its mystic and gets boring it s a shame because it could ve been a great movie great acting with a bland plot
0,this is the most ugly thing i ve ever seen in my life feels like plastic i hate it my boyfriend bought it for his friend he will probably be returning it way too expensive for the quality of this thing
1,the original jack johnson lp was my favourite miles record i also had an expensive japanese cd but all this would not prepare me for what i discover here over these cds one discovers the original sessions from which the record was made this is simply wonderful ok sometimes it takes quite a bit of patience to sit trhough all this but it is worth the time
1,i was testing a recipe using different syrups and got very similar results using light corn syrup and lyle s golden syrup
0,the description didn t say that the board game was sold separately i assumed a game pack had all the necessary materials it should hae said expansion pack it didn t so i had to go buy the original game it shouldn t be called wb anniversary it should be called scene it friends version we played one full round with teams and literally half of the questions had to do with the friends tv show all in all i was very disappointed with this product
1,tales from the crypt as you might know is the popular horror series that was on hbo during the early ninties so this film is the first movie to be made from that series the film is absolutley fantastic and has alot of gore nudity and humor in it unfortunately the sequal that was released after this was terrible and wasn t even worth it anyway the film starts of with a small segment where the cryptkeeper is directing a horror film then tells his usual stuff like some lame jokes then the real film starts with a car chase and offcourse billy zane as the collector was fantastic in his role he was hillarious and scary at the same time william sadler plays brayker who is a drifter that stumbles upon a motel and its inhabitants and is trying to hide from the collector who happens to want a medalion that brayker has the collecter also summons up some demons from hell in a very cool scene so he could create alot of havoc the film was also an homage to older horror films like the evil dead and night of the living dead as you ll see later when the characters are all stuck in this motel surrounded by demons all the characters were great in this film and you also get a bit of background with each one of them which is rare especialy in a gory horror film like this the film also stars jada pinket smith cch pounder who gets her arm ripped off in this film and thomas haden church who plays the obnoxious jerk and some other actors that i don t recognise all this makes for a great and enjoyable horror film that i highly recomend that you watch
1,with a cable modem took about hour and minutes to download unbox install the program and download the episode it s a great download speed considering the file is mb i was able to still use my computer ie and realplayer so the download is not a resource hog the menu bar includes a link to shop for more unbox titles which i found very convenient the quality is great but the video stutters in unbox maybe because it uses applications when playing video i chose to watch the episode on windows media player and i had no problems at all i ve bought and watched episodes all with the same results fast and unobstrusive download great quality and low price just use wmp or another player that can handle wma files to watch
1,we use these in all of our humidifiers and they do a great job
1,we received the original co sleeper as a gift we also considered getting a mini co sleeper and a pack n play or similar playard the main advantage of the co sleeper is that you can attach it to your bed so you can reach your baby without getting up the original co sleeper can also be used as a playard the playard capacity is up to pounds most brands are only rated to lb similarly the bassinet level rating is lb and most brands go to the co sleeper itself is about or pounds heavier than a typical playard the width is so the co sleeper can go through our doorways without collapsing unlike several playards that are around there is a trick to collapsing the top bars you have to pull the bar upwards when you press the buttons then it s easy otherwise you can push until your thumbs are purple and nothing happens this is explained on their website and should have been included in the manual i had a lot of reservations after reading other reviews here but am glad i chose to keep the co sleeper and expect it to use it constantly also the arm s reach canopy is really strong and beautiful and i m confident it ll keep the cats out
1,the bar itself is exactly what i wanted the only reason i m not giving stars is because of the troubles i had on the purchase the bar arrived literally hanging out of the box the box was really really torn up the collars that spin on the ends were not even with the bar needless to say the bar was useless untill i finally found some collars on ebay amazon refunded all my as soon as they were aware of the problem overall the bar is great
0,my daughter really loves this bus whenever it is in the room she rolls over to it and loves to sit up next to it she plays with the blocks and likes to discover how to hold them and also look at what is inside them the bad thing with this is that it rolls when she is holding onto it and the little piece with the shapes flaps up my daughter was playing with it one day and the piece flaped up and she ended up with her arm stuck in between it and the toy and she was leaning on the flap putting pressure on it against her arm but since that snaps off we took it off and there has not been an issue since
0,although this product is very nice i feel as though the wording that they use to describe it is incorrect to me the words charge all at once means that i can charge all the devices with only one cord that plugs into the wall however this is not the case this item is simply a method for organizing you devices although it is a nice idea it is certainly not worth the i paid and if it wasn t a gift and christmas wasn t days away i would return it i feel that by using the words charge all at once they are purposely misleading the customer
0,we got jason in space and we get pinhead in space this is pure nonsense words of wisdom to the makers of these sequels when you start putting horror movie villains in space to kill people it s time to stop making these movies
1,i am quite amazed that there are no recommendations or comments on this picture from folks once lived life of malik in ex yugoslavia the boy s very being does not becomes an expression of natural defiance toward the coming communist regime under tito and its spirit crushing regime cited re worded from last comment he is just stepping out of his childhood on june what a coincidence on a same date in turk army defeated serbian army on kosovo field and on a same date gavrilo princip in committed sarajevo assassination on austrian prince ferdinand creating excuse for germany to start great world war members of stalin s informbiro kicked yugoslavia out of membership of joint european communist party that event gives birth to this movie i would recommend much deeper research to interested party on happenings in yugoslavia ussr yugoslavia relations in order for that party to get a real feel for yugoslav society happenings after resolution of inforbiro bucharest eastern block sanctions towards yugoslavia few year plans to swim out of those sanctions and hostile breakout from east produced deviant political society of s yugoslavia why am i writing all this historical rubbish it is an attempt to make you watch this movie again with now seeing malik as yugoslavia his dreams as the yugoslavian nation dreams his sick and dying first love girlfriend as ussr his mother as tito his father as all innocent yugoslav political prisoners from early s his father s policeman jailer and friend as informbiro stalin his father s girlfriend as only good reason to spend some time in political prison etc etc and then comment me back or ask me for more info i am finding this movie context extremely complex being loaded with very hard to catch metaphors doesn t help its easy understanding

1,this is the first product i ve ever bought to work out my forearm so i can t compare it to anything else but i will say it does work i ve noticed a strength increase in my forearm in just a month of using it it s comfortable and easy to use i would like the highest resistance to be a little harder though
1,gave this as a gift to my father for fathers day he loved it said the steaks arrived in excellent condition packed in dry ice and we re very enjoyable one of the best fathers days gifts
0,jeunet shot himself in the foot with this nonsense i admire his attempt to create something cutting edge though personally i didn t see the whole film i walked out before the ending audrey tautou is probably one of france s least talented actresses yes i know we all loved her in jeunet s single sucessful film amelie which is probably the only film of hers that most american s have seen but please the girl can barely act has no presence and no joie de vivre since amelie had it s success tautou has appeared in no less than a dozen terrible movies the foreign shelf at blockbuster is lined with them i can hear the howls of dissent from the readers of this review right now angrily clicking their disapproval of my review but i ve studied film at nyu and have seen virtually every french film good or bad since before the nouvelle vague trust me on this one this is a crummy film a worthy effort at being cutting edge by jeunet perhaps but still a crummy film
1,this game is a great one i enjoyed this game it is one of my favorites i recommend this game for anyone who enjoys final fantasy or a good rpg
0,this camera looks cool but it s so so not cool the people responsible for this device should be ashamed of themselves this is by far one of the worst products i have ever purchased ever by the second day the lens cap no longer stayed in place it clips on but not for long the camera s internal memory is rubbish and the camera totally destroyed my memory card somehow it s complelety unreadable even with a card i could only take a few short quality videos you can shoot more video if you use the low quality settings and i m talkin low quality worse than any video you ve seen online more problems include the battery cover falling off without hardly even touching it the controls and interface are not intuitive you ll probably end up accidentally deleting files you meant to keep oh and the earbuds that come with the camera player hunk o junk are huuuuge they aren t comfortable in the least and the cord is too short i had the camera in my pocket and when i stood erect the earphones were violently yanked from my ears they re obviously intended for oompa loompas i m sure i could have found more problems with this thing but it eventually died on me for no reason don t waste your time with this you will be sorely disappointed in fact if i could give this product a rating of stars i would do so i m so extremely disappointed with this camera
1,the wine spectator is one of those magazines designed to reassure you that you re rich or that you soon could be all in the context of a shared love for the fruit of the vine there s lots of deadly serious material in this glossy pleasing publication but if you re a lover of wine who is not rich the category includes this reviewer you need to learn to take it with a sense of humor just enjoy the game that game includes a travelogue of the world s wine regions as well as the possibility of gaining a decent education via month by month reading in viticulture and wine appreciation itself this reader is in it for the long haul i hope to enjoy good wine at an affordable cost for the duration of this earthly slog and the wine spectator is my companion along the way my job takes me out for many dinners in various parts of the world that include wine splendored places like france south africa chile argentina australia new zealand and of course northern california but with wineries now in of the usa s fifty states what s not a wine region these days on those business treks i find myself out for dinner as often as not it s personally satisfying to know just enough to order a pinotage in capetown since only south africa produces this varietal or to opt for one of argentina s persuasive malbecs because they re just that good we re not talking wine snobbery here just satisfaction at the margins of life s all too margin less journeys if this sounds like your game the wine spectator may be a worthwhile investment even if not consider splitting a subscription with a colleague that s what i do at half the price i get a fine magazine and avoid burdening my bookshelves with one more heavy beautiful pleasant magazine life can deal you worse
1,does the job nicely i am not an audiophile so i dont get into the nit picking when it comes to speaker wire just tell me what gauge to use and i do it seemed high quality to me

1,goth meets cabaret or rather gothic music influenced by cabaret thats the best way to describe this wonderful little release by projekt the eleven tracks here provide an introduction to the dark cabaret scene and do so quite well the first song coin operated boy by the dresden dolls is a great start and the cd continues onward to devious evil night together by jill tracy which sets up a wonderful film noir mood and on to the darker electronic dance number cabaret fortune teller by audra to a remix of knock three times on my coffin by projekt veterans black tape for a blue girl along the way numerous other bands are covered sam rosenthal s side project revue noir makes their debut on this cd with husky feminine vocals provided by nicki jaine who also has a solo song pretty faces on the cd as well personally i loved revue noir and find nicki jaine s voice to be quite alluring but i also know some btfabg fans who dislike her vocals so you ve been warned but all in all i think anyone with a task for the dark should check out this cd at the very least its a cheap and decent introduction to a whole new style and thats always a good thing
1,this version of pride and prejudice takes quite a few liberties with jane austen s most beloved story but manages to endear itself in spite of that olivier s darcy will be a shock to those who are in love with colin firth or matthew macfadyen but he does so well that you ll be charmed by him in no time and greer garson s lizzy is as spirited as you could wish the costumes are all wrong yes and it is a little distracting for those of us who revel in regency dramas but once you get over that and immerse yourself into the story you ll be swept away highly recommended
1,this is a compilation but the original incense and peppermints album was really revolutinary for the time i will date myself now but i remember hearing this song on the radio in our car and was mesmerized by it it was the first lp i had ever bought i actually wore out the groves on the lp and came across another a few years ago to this day almost years after i first heard the strawberry alarm clock i still like incense and peppermints as well as their other songs their style ranges from acid rock to jazz the musicians are all very talented and the band works as a team as opposed to many of the bands of the era their recordings are really high quality and certainly not over processed like a lot of today s music is sac was in an era where s music was in transition from the early beatles and old time r r sound to a more acid rock sound lyrics like tune in turn on turn your eyes around look at yourself were typical of sac s lyrical style as well as the thinking of the times it was an odd time on one side we had woodstock mini skirts muscle cars and fun fun fun but on the dark side there were civil rights problems and the viet nam war this transitional period was a kind of awakening for the country and for music although not as popular as names like the doors jefferson airplane and steppenwolf the strawberry alarm clock still had a huge following my only regret is that i didn t get a chance to see them or the doors when they came to the city where i lived during the late s this album is a nice compilation of sac s hits the songs are as fresh and original sounding as they were almost years ago
1,i recently got the and i loved it at first mainly because of the multi functions it could do however eventually i found out that the phone part of this pda is not as great as my previous camera phone my friends complain that they hear a lot of outside noise while talking the phone ear volume is quite low and i have to constantly put it to max it if i am in noisy places pros software the windows applications word excel media player plus ability to create office documents and play games hardware micro sd slot sandisk card cost me bucks wireless internet you could connect this device to any wireless unsecure network to get to the internet i dont have a data plan with cingular but i connect to the internet from home through my wifi home network if iam at a coffee shop i could connect to their secure network and get to internet for free cons a bit bulky to carry around camera is not as expected the view finder is sloppy and cannot capture images in low light battery needs to be charged every second day depends on usage but even with light use i had to charge it every other day best suitable for internet savvy people who are on the move email and messaging as a pocket pc to listen to music need to purchase micro sd card accessories boxwave leather case leather case by boxwave fits pretty good and protects the device the only problem is that after you put this case on the phone volume needs to be set to the max even after that you wont be able to hear the other person so well but the boxwaver case could be opened half way and folded over bluetooth this device works very well with blue tooth bottom line if you are ok with minor inconveniences while using the phone this is for you
0,the picture of this curtain makes it look thicker than it really is by a long shot it does not screen out unwanted pests birds and harsh sunlight well maybe birds but certainly not bugs or light there are large gaps between each strand of beads and it s completely see through this is not what you are looking for if you want a little privacy on a positive note amazon made the return very easy
1,make sure you get the cheats to keep a lot of cash in the bank this game is totally addictive
1,far more complex and feministic than the girls and flapper fashions would have you believe needs to be seen in it s entirity and revived for a modern audience as the series is now an overlooked gem the leads are excellent and follow in the best traditions of such british historical series such as upstairs downstairs if you have never seen it you will not be dissapointed and the lead actresses are extremely good both rada trained and both have worked extensively with the royal shakespeare company
1,this tee shirt is my first under armour purchase and i took a chance by ordering it without ever trying on any under armour before i m not dissatisfied but it isn t my favorite tee shirt on the positive side the weight of the fabric is good for exercising especially for the gym and it would be a good single layer for outside warm temperatures the fit is pretty good i am average sized and wear sizes i don t like really tight clothing and this shirt is loose enough to be comfortable but fitted enough so that it doesn t look like i m wearing a bag on the negative side i am a little short waisted and the shirt is long for me and bunches at the top of my hips which i don t like but accept also the vee neck is not a very strong vee pictures of this shirt are true in that respect a lot of technical tees are like this designed more for function than for style maybe and vee necks are essentially a crew x vee hybrid i prefer a true vee neck lastly the fabric has a slightly rough scratchy feel which seems characteristic of today s technical fabrics it s not clear to me that the cost in hand is worth the added function of wicking in this instance overall i consider this shirt fine for the gym or for an hour long run but i wouldn t want to spend a lot of extended time in it

1,i ve tried a few types of vegan chocolate chip cookies and was always disappointed with how bland they were and loaded with fat and calories these are not only the least amount of calories that i ve seen for a vegan cookie of this size but i found that these double chocolate chip cookies were better than the non vegan ones i ve had in the past they are so so so good whoever said that you need dairy and eggs in chocolate i have my omnivore friends and family try these cookies to show them that i am far from deprived two thumbs up and highly recommended from this vegan chocoholic

0,i understand why the beatles are the top sellers in rock music as they suck they only made about two decent songs in their hey jude a pretty song and ballad of john and yoko the sixties was a horrible decade of rock music i would have to be said that only very few good songs came out in the sixties which one of them is neil young s down by the river i have listened to the beatles for about a month and thought how lame and pathetic their music was they were hugely one of the most overrated bands of all time this one album is definately not the album to buy at all unless you are a sick moron who does not have a good taste in music here you will get of the worst songs ever recorded if you want good music i recommend go buy albums from foreigner dire straits green day guns n roses and metallica insted don t buy this album at most costs as you will waste money on awful songs
1,i recently bought one of these to put in my wife s car the kit is pretty complete and well organized you could pick up most of the items over time and maybe save some money but i liked having the consolidated kit and particularly the air compressor the bag itself is heavy nylon and has velcro on the bottom so it won t slide all over a carpeted area
1,when you get these cartridges right out of the box they work great but after you start to print out a lot of pictures you really notice the quality deteriorate it really seems to run out of one color much quicker than the others personally its usually red it has caught me with my pants down a couple times going to print out a project the night before its due only to run out of red or blue ink i would definetly suggest to always have an extra one around just in case
0,i can hardly eat this for all of the salt it leaves you thirsty it s so bad the ingredients list reads literally organic sweet corn sea salt and nothing else they need to make it organic sweet corn and nothing else and they d probably have something really great as it is i m stuck with bags of salty corn that i ll have to give away

0,this is just another attack by organized medicine on alternative treatments and therapies in particular chiropractic dr rosenfeld comes across as biased ignorant and at times completely malicious in the information he provides his assertion that he loves chiropractors is disingenous at best he prefers non specific manipulation by a doctor who can also prescribe toxic drugs he lists warnings about chiropractic that are extremely rare occuring one in many millions and suggests that these are common occurances he fails to mention that the practice of allopathic medicine is the third leading cause of preventable death in the united states which is the very reason we need more practitioners of the so called alternatives if you want good advice start by avoiding books on alternative medicine written by medical doctors especially this one
0,the plastic screen on this case was very hard to keep clean and very easy to scratch so the view quality was horrible also the case was way to tight and was difficult to get the video ipod in and out
1,when a young artist names her first two albums not judy or collins but a maid of constant sorrow and golden apples of the sun you know she takes herself seriously originaly released in and their names were all i knew until i saw this cd recently who will buy this i wondered just to see the only copy snatched right in front of me the comparisons with first two baez albums are inevitable some songs were recorded by both althought collins shows much more passion and involment where baez seemingly seduces herself with the beauty of her voice on these early albums collins is frighteningly devoted keeper of the flame and her repertoire is almost exclusively traditional which means not only ethereal beauty but also a certain to some ears overpowering seriousness cleverly mellowed by inclusion of joyous o daddy be gay a cousin to her grandfather recorded years later althought i honestly love these songs and listen only this cd for days these early albums are today much more significant as seeds of collins later trademarks voice will soar much higher in the future she slipped w b yeats into traditional folk collection just to later blossom into first rate art pop singer and as they were product of their greenwich village times they may sound a bit dated to some modern ears but they are still hauntingly beautiful to me i waited their re release for too long
0,this product has the potential to be tremendous but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched that absolutely ruins the ipod video experience now that there is lcd glare exposing all the scratches also there is a big rhigo skin logo on the front which makes the case even that more distracting i m sure that it isn t polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail what a letdown p s if you are buying the version of this case it will double the thickness of your setup
0,i bought this album because i loved the title song it s such a great song how bad can the rest of the album be right well the rest of the songs are just filler and aren t worth the money i paid for this it s either shameless bubblegum or oversentimentalized depressing tripe kenny chesney is a popular artist and as a result he is in the cookie cutter category of the nashville music scene he s gotta pump out the albums so the record company can keep lining their pockets while the suckers out there keep buying this garbage to perpetuate more garbage coming out of that town i ll get down off my soapbox now but country music really needs to get back to it s roots and stop this pop nonsense what country music really is and what it is considered to be by mainstream are two different things
1,great little digital thermomter as long as you keep it out of direct sunlight i have it in the back of the house pointing west and it only gets minimal sun i have checked it against various banks in town and it is very accurate was just what i wanted and for the price it works great
1,though only a fraction of books have been written about the great war when compared to wwii there are some great ones to pick from for instance for a great narrative of the american involvement in world war i try the doughboys by gary mead for a good look at the events of gallipoli just last year john laffin wrote the agony of gallipoli which is a wonderful brief book on that travesty of warfare there is a great book which chronicles verdun called the price of glory by alistair horne the list goes on and on whether it be flanders the somme passchendaele africa jutland whatever your area of interest might be the point i m making is there are plenty of specialized accounts of world war i and even several overviews of the war but john keegan s the first world war is a great source for an overall study of the war this book covers it all in brief detail accounts are given on virtually every facet of the war and even some of the best insight available for the events which led up to the war itself every aspect of the war is given its due diligence here i ve never been a big fan of keegan his writing to me is a struggle at times this book is no exception it reads somewhat like a page textbook and borders on tedious at times but as much as i dislike his stuffy british writing style he is a virtual historical genius his knowledge and research of the events cannot be faulted and he writes for the most part without imparting his own commentary in fact without prior knowledge one would hardly surmise that keegan is himself british the big exception to that is keegan s typically british hard line stance of not giving the american forces their just dues in this aspect he even contradicts himself in several places he goes to great length to illustrate to the reader that in the early months of germany was still very much capable of winning the war the western front had been bolstered by the arrival of german troops from the now defunct eastern front the new soldiers from the east brought with them battle hardened experience and a mindset that they could triumph as they had in the east he goes on to tell of how effective german advances had been in early april advancing a fifty mile wide front over twenty miles in a matter of days he then follows this sort of information with telling the reader how though ambitious and courageous the american forces were largely inconsequential to the conclusion of the war when he does acknowledge american victory it is quickly followed with excuses for the german forces that said if you re seeking information about just how american forces rallied to bring an end to over four years of war in a matter of a few months this book will infuriate you however if you are looking for a good overview of the war as a whole this is one of the best out there i should add the book has a quite lengthy notes and bibliography section for further study monty rainey
1,this film must be scrutinized in the light of being tony scott a famed and renowned director of spot lights and subtle commercials at that moment additionally the figure of the vampire is refreshed and renovated with the presence of the feminine vision sarandon and deneuve are in very good shape and bowie gives another of his outrageous and perverse performances after his standout performance in the man who fell to earth and furyo so think about all those factors at the moment you bet for watch it it s extremely important to my mind this is one of the hottest cult movies of the eighties

0,the game is called fritz and chesster fritz is the boy chester is a rat that girl you see in the picture her name is bianca she never actually plays she just says things like well done brave knight and asks stupid questions at one point poor bianca points out that the queen is the strongest piece and fritz makes a comment about his mother chewing out his father the tone and context are extremely anti woman in my opinion he also counters by saying that boys are smarter it seems like the makers of this game were really threatened by the fact that you have to call the most powerful piece she to take the queen down a notch they refer to a group or queens as a harem to demonstrate how this powerful piece moves they have the queen run around picking flowers as fast as she can a male voice says off you go in a tone which one can only assume is meant to accompany a little pat on her behind
0,so i m mostly with other folks on the content if you get lucky the small sampling of product reviews will include some item you re looking at or should and the anemic review will prompt you to follow up at the manufacturers website the buyer s guide was of decent breadth and useless depth on the bikes no bikes from gary fisher the inventor of mountain biking huh i m primarily interested in mtb and the issues of mountain bike are good but you only get issues and the content is redundant between the two magazines or even within each mag for instance the may mtb issue had a story on rebuilding trails in los alamos i actually really like their reviews of specific places and the cover also boasted a great american trail guide one of the four trails talked about in this great american guide los alamos i can spot a cut and paste job when i see one also in that issue the bike that started a revolution about the sp stumpjumper a great idea for an interesting article that was butchered into a condescending comic strip also having ordered the mag for the issues of mtb i was disappointed when they didn t even show up emails with customer service resulted in one of the more disappointing did you not read my email type exchanges two months later and i now have one of the two missing issues in hand they have great photography and i have yet to find a better option but i m really disappointed i won t renew
0,at first i really liked these until i realized that my baby just used about liners in about week it s not easy to squeeze the air out since i keep track of how much our baby eats how can i do that when the liner is all scrunched up not worth the money on the liners and there is plenty of air that gets into the liner even if once in a while you do manage to get the air out i m sorry i ever bought them
0,the original csi series is fantastic because you figure out the crimes by finding the evidence this series uses the csi name without the investigating that makes the original so good it is mainly a mellow drama surrounding the lives of the characters some people will like the drama the writers have put togethor but there s no mystery
1,this is one of my favorite products i have purchased as a new mommy i love it it warms the avent bottles great it took some trials to determine how much water to add but now i have it down great you can over heat and then you will burn yourself if your not careful it is not like the negative reviews if you pay attention and use the right amount of water it does not warm the playtex ventair bottles i guess because of the vent but i preferred the avent bottles anyway the cooler does keep bottles cold for up to hours if you remember to freeze the freezer pack each day we have a story house and this helped us so much i have the other first year single warmer also and it is in my kitchen and it is great as well this is definitly worth the money

0,well the only good thing one can say about the treo battery is that it s thinner the battery for the treo basically got one through a normal business day as the treo battery only lasts a hours under business use the descriptive adjectives that come to mind are deplorable distressing lamentable unsatisfactory and unsuitable i m really dissapointed that palm delivered such as lousy battery with the treo but happily there is a quick fix buy more batteries and keep them charged and don t leave home without them

0,while this rack looks good and appears well constructed it s mounting system leaves something to be desired while attempting to lock this unit down tight enough to keep it from constantly twisting around i managed to bend the locking lever now don t get me wrong this is mounted on my wife s bike a cruiser and has had at most lbs of groceries in the handy basket you can purchase that slides right on but having to stop every so often to straighten this thing out is quite annoying i suppose i will end up modifying the locking mechanism to avoid further aggravation by the way i have a delta rear rack on my atb that mounts to the seat post using a bolt clamp much sturdier and it was much less expensive as well

1,i have always been a fan of the star wars saga but never really read any of the novels this was my first sw novel i must say i want to be a sith i just finished this novel last night and honestly want a coming if u read the epilogue of this book u will grind your teeth the storyline at first felt familiar but then radically changed but had the sw ripple effects i however got more excited because i played kotor the game kotor and jedi academy so allot of the visuals and things in the book were already visualized for me in those games i loved the entire transformation and how gradually even the sith were headed like the jedi in it an amazing story and can t wait to a sequel if any
1,james you wrote ben is weak immature a stalker lazy has bad taste in women and at is unable to tell his parents no when they ask him to wear a scuba suit for their family friends wow revolutionary film making not yes ben was weak immature and had bad taste in women his learning to overcome his weakness immaturity bad taste in women and then defy his family and elaine s family was his coming of age story that was the point of the movie it went right over your head the acting was dead on and the subject matter was shocker when it came out how could you not love this movie maybe you need to grow up a little to see the value watch it again in a few years i think you will change your low opinion of this great classic movie over time

0,if you can smell the chemicals being emitted by these slippers than your child is breathing them in also the chemicals are being absorbed through the skin of your childs feet they are made with known cancer causing chemicals they are also manufactured over seas wher the deq epa etc have no jurisdiction over the processes used to manufacture these slippers my two year old daughter was given a pair and they are now hidden in the garage did not want to put them into a land fill until some one has analyzed the toxic emission from these horrible smeling slippers benzene poly vinyl chloride all kill the liver

1,i like the sound i get from the mic and it is very good valuue for the money for prosumer cam owners but consumer level camera owners should beware i bought this mic and found that it was way too sensitive hot for consumer cameras like a panasonic which has no audio input level control it picks up too much background noise and overwhelms the camera s automatic gain controller when things get loud i m not sure if the had a mic attenuation setting or if turning it on would have been a sufficient answer i put a cheap radio shack in line volume controller in between the mic and the camera which can introduce crackle if you adjust it while recording on prosumer cams with input level control like the canon it works fine even without turning on mic attenuation if you have a camcorder with input level controls i might get this another important caveat you cannot run this mic through a the connection of a beachtek mixer box you ll hear nothing on the beachtek s output because of an impedance mismatch i don t know if putting an xlr adapter on the mic cable would work
0,genius is an educational simulation game where you re building an industrial complex plop down factories roads houses fire departments and such as the game progresses you complete physics puzzles to obtain new technologies and product improvements you subscribe to newspapers which contain answers to some questions and the knowledge or equations needed to solve others the physics problems are entertaining well designed well documented implemented excellently and can be quite fun they are presented as problems you encounter during business operation for example while developing a new product all of the information you need is provided the game will appeal to children up but these physics problems are more like age up because they require high school math so children youths may need help from a parent who remembers algebra and preferably physics yikes some of the questions are easy fun some require you to be comfortable with algebra converting between units and applying formulae a few are very difficult fortunately the questions are the same each time so after figuring out the answers you can write them down just enter the answers next time sometimes the game even gives you the correct answer after it is too late so you can write it down for next time unfortunately i can t find a cheat sheet list of answers on the web too bad this would really help the level of difficulty of these questions isn t a problem just be warned the simulation side of the game is suffers in comparison the industrial simulation controls are poorly documented what each building does and when why where it is appropriate inappropriate and how to run the game is somewhat of a mystery there s no way to figure out whether building something will be good or bad except trial and error logic doesn t always help bad decisions spiral out of control seem to lead inevitably to bankruptcy unfortunately wrong answers on the physics problems can have the same effect there is a statistics report that is supposed to give feedback on whether your company is making or loosing money but this form doesn t have enough information so expect some trial error some frustration some algebra some physics some reading through magazines looking for obscure clues genius can be really fun but could use some interface improvements highly recommended for anyone taking physics in high school or college
1,besides the fact that ipod is a skinny little waste of time let s also mock the fact that it plays about two formats whatever mac plays and woohoo what a selection then we have the iaudio it has perhaps a half inch thickness at most over the ipod for the standard battery model and anyway is as thick as an xl though it includes so much more bang for your buck even if some of that bang is kind of useless but come on an fm radio isn t ipod standard almost every other portable hd player has that by now about the only thing ipod has over iaudio is movie quality which is admittedly better but i m fairly basic i m buying it for my music not to watch a bloody movie on a tiny screen if i want to do that i ll buy a portable dvd player for pictures unless they re ridiculously high quality this suits just fine but it s not the pictures you should be interested in when buying one of these sweet players it s the sound quality which is marvelous it consistantly beats ipod it has bbe equalizer and it not plays and aac but wma wav ooc and flac flac and if you download rockbox which is something you ll have to research on your own kids you can create themes boost your battery life and augment your listening pleasure even further the only drawbacks are the battery life if you don t use playlists skip around a lot or play high bitrate files all of which are fixed rather well by rockbox and the subpack what is a subpack it s a fairly good idea done badly it s a piece of plastic you can easily lose that clicks into the bottom jack of your player in it are the power jack line out which has a bad bass roll off problem unfortunately and line in jack and usb port the general idea was to make the player smaller by moving all of these jacks onto something else but it wasn t executed too well buying a charger from com solves the power jack and usb port problems nicely and is recommended most highly and did i mention recording with the built in mic is amazing you can get good quality concerts with this puppy plus it s black ipod comes standard white and the is just better

1,music tunes into a part of the brain that might be connected to math skills in any case making music is fun it s participatory and it teaches about rhythm counting and doing things cooperatively a collection of percussion instruments like blocks and percussion accessories like sleigh bells are great to keep in a box for kids take them out and have the kids keep time along with a favorite cd or with a song they are singing this is a very inexpensive toy and one that can teach a lot it is also great for christmas bring the kids along to carol and have the smallest kids keep time with the sleigh bells or make up your own percussion accompaniement

1,here s another great film that sprung forth from the czech new wave another film that through its small gestures and subtleties makes some big statements i ll leave it for you all to discover forman s delightful insights into human behavior in loves of a blonde suffice it to say the plot which involves a young girl s hana brejchová attempt to find true love as a factory girl could have become whimsical and even sentimental in other hands in forman s the whole thing is grounded on earth instead of being a weightless romantic comedy loves of a blonde aims for realism and while forman maintains a relatively light touch on the proceedings everything that happens to her she finds love in a piano player makes love to him one night and then eventually pursues him to his home where she meets his ever bickering parents still has its own kind of weight to it the only way i can describe it is i guess the weight of real life i haven t seen a more accurate recreation of a marriage that has dulled out in any other movie than i saw in the second half of loves of a blonde with milda s parents it is comic yes but it is also uncannily realistic and maybe you ll recognize your own parents when you see the control freak mother and the carefree father in this film as for the blonde of the movie well she doesn t necessarily become sympathetic as the movie progresses but we get a sense of why she begins to attach herself to the piano player milda she sees him as an escape from the drudgeries of factory life understand that and you ll find the ending of this film poignant and maybe kinda sad her dream has been shattered but she keeps on believing it anyway either out of hope or simply desperation but enough of my pretentious analysis hehe the point is milos forman s loves of a blonde like jiri menzel s arguably more celebrated closely watched trains is a film that though short at minutes takes its time to observe human nature in the face of oppression in its own light and subtle way its comic surface only makes it seem like a slight movie but in its subtleties and scenes of comic observation it has a heck of a lot more to say about our little human foibles than a lot of other romantic comedies do recommended

0,not only was this difficult to set up even a generally polite but sadly ill informed technical helper from belkin was baffled regarding the simplest steps and keyphrases but once i finally managed to get it to work by simply as a last resort resetting the router with a paper clip it had practically no range whatsoever in fact my macbook pro placed within inches of the router itself only received a signal and once the threshold of the room was crossed the signal disappeared altogether a free four year old linksys router which i received with my earthlink home networking package and which this belkin was supposed to replace always worked with a full signal everywhere in the house and rarely failed and linksys is supposed to be notoriously mac unfriendly anyway i hope that there are enough ups trucks in america to handle the returns that this item mine included will require

1,combine the high iso low noise and fast shutter speed for great blur free shots on low light and moving subjects this is what only fuji can offer to you on compact camera class the doesn t have is image stabilized lenses or a ccd shift sensor which other cameras use to reduce the effect of blur from camera shaking but this kind of stabilization is really only useful for or more zoom for just typical zoom on ultra compact p s you just need to hold it firmly and will get the same results is also can t prevent blur from moving subjects with a high iso like on you can use faster shutter speeds that will freeze subjects and prevent blur from camera shaking too fuji super ccd sensor provides the lowest noise on high iso you will find on s compact cameras the quality is only comparable to the big dslr professional cameras ah and the face detection is not just a gimmick or marketing appeal it s really great specially if someone who doesn t know how to focus on the face then recompose the scene is taking pictures of you with they will not miss the shot

1,quinceanera happy birthday amos lassen and literary pride one of the great mexican tardyons is celebrated by the new movie quinceanera a traditional rite of passage it takes place to signify that fifteen year old girls enter the world of womanhood magdalena emily rios is preparing for her party when the movie opens but she has a secret she is pregnant she was raised a devout catholic girl and the fact that she is with child shames her conservative parents and they retaliate by ostracizing her distraught by her banishment from her family magdalena turns to her uncle tomas chalo gonzales who lives with her cousin carlos jesse garcia in a small apartment in echo park los angeles carlos is open with her about his being gay and is being wooed by a new male couple which has moved into the neighborhood what results is a ménage a trios between carlos and the couple one a television producer and the other a british citizen carlos bonds emotionally with one of the men and the situation becomes sticky and it jeopardizes magdalena s new family unit in effect the movie takes a careful look at class differences and in doing so looks at the gay characters involved as flawed and it is obvious that carlos is little more than a sexual pastime for the couple of upper middle class men what results is a highly emotional drama that we do not see often in american films but that foreign films seem to have a knack for dealing with performances are excellent in the film and the directors richard glatzner and wash westmoreland give us a fresh new look on the gay cinema screen emily rios is a charismatic young actress of whom we shall undoubtedly hear more and chalo gonzalez as uncle tomas gives a performance not easily forgotten he is warm and laden with emotion that glows in his portrayal everything about this movie is fine the script the actors the photography and the open description of sexuality as well as the sincerity and the love with which it was made awarded several prizes such as the dramatic audience and jury prizes at the sundance festival quinceanera is a marvelous film especially because it wears its queerness so well the gay it balances both gay and straight story lines and the way it deals with such important issues as sexuality maturation culture clashes and love simply put this is an amazing film and should not be missed
1,i love all the varieties of chocolate and if you mix them in a blender they are smooth and creamy you can add a frozen banana or a couple of ice cubes and the shake is thick enough to be a milkshake shaking by hand or using a hand held mixer does not do these nutrition shakes justice these are a great meal replacement healthy nutritious and full of quality protein
1,this simple scale is light easy to carry and store i tested it thoroughly when it arrived against my older dial scale it read the same weight but actually with less flucuation when i shifted on it i was careful to keep it on a flat surface i had good luck on old hardwood floors less luck on our old bumpy tile floors in the bathroom it was very consistent on a level surface i tested it several times in a row with the same reading and various times throughout the day nothing read unusually i really like the form factor of this scale it s so small not small spacewise but just thin light with a nice solid place to plant your feet
1,i highly recommend this item as soon as your little one can sit up on his own this is a must have for all moms it fits all shopping carts except costco but including target as well as those icky high chairs available at restaurants it keeps baby and mommy s hands from touching the cart handle and prevents the kiddo from wedging his legs in the wrong hole in the cart a must have this is the gift i give at baby showers i ve had for over a year and it has survived many a washing with a touch of bleach still looks good
1,thankfully moleskine has returned to the and earlier format in the weekly pages the vertical columns apparently a short lived experiment for are gone and replaced by the signifcantly better horizontal spaces for each day moleskine makes great products the planner is well constructed and will survive a year of heavy use with ease the small size makes it ideal for a purse or briefcase the hardcover adds protection and the pockets add functionality the are perfect for slipping in a phone number or business card to keep handy it is a classy simple way to keep track of dates and appointments my only wish is that the text could be slightly darkened on the pages to stand out more i have been a longtime user of the moleskine notebook and will continue to be one for years to come

1,alfred hitchcock s second film after being brought to america by david o selznick was suspicion which he made while on loan to rko pictures as in his first hollywood flick rebecca he put joan fontaine to very good use and ultimately these two films made her into a star fontaine won the best actress academy award for her portrayal of lina mclaidlaw a bookish and innocent but wealthy young woman who gets swept off her feet by the caddish johnnie aysgarth cary grant after their quick courtship and marriage against her father s wishes lina begins to see johnnie for who he really is a penniless leech but she naively continues to love him nonetheless johnnie s charm is ostensible yet his irresponsible ways are increasingly becoming inexcusable lina s trust eventually gives way to suspicion when she begins to believe that he might go to any length to pay off his mounting debts hitchcock masterfully builds suspense in this movie and manages to maintain it for the duration of the picture the movie s only flaw is its tacked on and seemingly contrived final scene which we are told was due either to mr grant s popularity during these years or to the existence of the production code in effect in hollywood at that time hitchcock wanted a darker ending but as we see here he lost that battle however he did not give in as completely as some would have us believe the ending remains ambiguous enough to allow us to project either a happy or a sinister conclusion according to our own sensibilities suspicion is classic hitchcock grant and fontaine turn in masterful performances and nigel bruce is irresistible as the dimwitted and loveable beaky johnnie s old chum the flawed ending prevents placing suspicion at the top of any list of hitchcock s achievements but it is a fine film nevertheless and i can only give it my highest recommendation jeremy w forstad
0,fight club is without a doubt the greatest film i ve ever seen yeah i m a fanboy and what and to make a great film flow you need great music right well you need great music that fits the film and the dust brother s score more than does the trick the film is dark yet satirical and it needed a score that would compliment that however the score simply doesn t stand up on its own at times in the film it perfectly enhances the dark atmosphere but its only a part of a tense scene and hence it sounds rather empty by itself no matter how much you like the film or thought the music sounded good in it as i did i wouldn t recommend it like so many other scores it could have been made into great music but fails since its just lifted from the film
1,spanish born actor javier bardem gives a staggering performance as cuban poet reinaldo arenas which is lucky since he is in almost every frame of this film in fact he is the only constant in a biopic that sometimes feels disjointed and a bit long winded piecing together as it does the various episodes of arenas life sometimes sacrificing narrative flow in the process at the same time this is a powerfully moving film that displays the intensity of the post revolution persecution experienced by cubans more effectively than either carlos eire s memoir waiting for snow in havana or hollywood confections such as sydney pollack s havana or richard lester s cuba director julian schnabel an artist himself who had previously directed a film about celebrity graffiti artist jean michael basquiat jumps back and forth like an abstract painter clarifying time periods by employing captions we first see arenas birth in rural cuba followed by glimpses of his poverty stricken childhood the story then moves forward to just before castro rose to power and when arenas becomes a revolutionary living in eastern cuba by as both an open gay and an intellectual arenas writings have made him anathema to castro s regime for the next fifteen years he shuttles back and forth between jail and freedom and arenas story sheds much light on the difficult of living as a member of not just one but two minorities in highly visual terms schnabel creates a striking tableau of life in cuba that shows how getting out of cuba was not an easy decision for natives to make and arenas like most cubans makes it only begrudgingly at first imagine having to give up everything and fleeing there is a vividly filmed sequence of an all night party in an abandoned convent that houses a homemade hot air balloon shades of jules verne by which one of them decides to escape selfishly and fatally there are also some powerful scenes that show the humiliating torture arenas experienced in prison ending finally with his escape and ultimately his departure from cuba in the mariel harbor exodus of as one of castro s undesirables arenas then went into exile in new york living with his former lover lazaro sadly soon after his arrival in america he became ill with aids the american sequence is short allowing maximum time for the cuba ordeal that makes up most of the film the charismatic bardem is superb capturing the emotional combustion in his character s life there are a few guest appearances that somewhat undermine the story s realism a nearly unrecognizable turn by sean penn as a cuban peasant and in dual roles johnny depp as a sadistic closeted lieutenant and a transvestite named bon bon who entertains prisoners in el moro prison and the use of english versus spanish seems to be more at the director s discretion than the actual circumstances within scenes but these are forgivable indulgences since schnabel has made a valuable film telling a tale of cuban struggle and hardship of a type that we surprisingly don t see that often in film at minutes it does seem a bit overlong but arenas packed a full life in his years most importantly schnabel successfully paints a picture depicting the influences behind arenas writing his difficult childhood his conflicted feelings for his mother coming to terms with his sexuality the revolution in cuba and the pain of being an outcast in his own country as one might expect from a painter schnabel uses images as effectively as words to advance the story most are simple and quite beautiful such as an early scene of a rainstorm that turns into a raging torrent of water a later shot of countless prison inmates dangling bars of soap outside of their jail cells or flashes of snow falling in new york as arenas and his friend lie on a speeding convertible nevertheless because arenas as a writer dealt in words it is impossible to tell his story without embracing this component and bardem s economical voiceovers attest to that aspect in a dramatically effective manner strongly recommended in spite of the relatively minor flaws the dvd also includes an interesting french television interview with the real arenas from
0,this toy is great fun but it isn t very durable ours broke after about an hour there was a loud pop and then it stopped erupting i guess the plastic bladder must have given out the kids were terribly disappointed
0,if you can make it work or if you are lucky to get a non defective unit it can only read card at a time needs specific usb power requirements needs the usb power be and not else you will get usb hub power exceeded errors the worst part is that the mainboard i tested is and still didn t work the cards inserted on the lower card slots have to be inserted upside down from time to time you can get the message usb device not recognized contacted support service there average not so good support forum has several topics complaining about this product couldn t get a replacement since days tigerdirect warranty have expired can t send the unit to ultra because currently i m outside the us and as i stated customer service is not good bottom line don t buy this item

0,my sons got this toy for their birthday since their physical therapist recommended getting a push ride on toy with a wide base for learning to walk while they enjoy the buttons and sounds and like being pushed around on it i do not find it helpful for development the handle pushes forward and comes off very easily it is not heavy enough for them to pull up on without tipping over onto them and the seat is very wide and square so their legs will have to grow considerably before they would be able to ride it also some of the stickers are starting to peel off and we ve only had it a month for an older child it would probably make a decent ride on toy but if you are wanting a push toy to help with early walking keep looking
0,this toy is a ripoff for yr olds and you ll get annoyed couase the games are sooooooooooo hard even for me a year old and in stead you should try out this game its an internet game its better than fat tamagotchi and if you drop the tmagotchi in water it dies and evr forever do you hear me go to you wont regret it or you can laugh at me i dont car

1,both of my kids got these for christmas great idea not as expensive as a dvd player for the car especially for those of us who don t want the portable one plan to get next vehicle with built in and the picture was really better than i thought it would be however i only got my children two discs a piece to start now no discs worthwhile can be found anywhere the only ones that are ever on the racks online en masse are the star wars pack none of today s kids really want that the tony hawk skate park obviously they aren t interested there either and fear factor let s face it if you let your kids watch ff you need to take the videonow player and hit yourself in the head hard and even if i do find a couple on ebay the selection is so limited i wish i d just bought a cheap portable dvd player hasbro really missed the boat on this one it could have been a great thing but they didn t make enough discs of the ones they do produce and need to put more shows out for the kids my advice don t buy it i am very disappointed in the disc selection this is already at the bottom of the toy box

1,i ve been looking for a pair of headphones like this for years i ve used these for months now and wear them almost everyday i ride a motorcycle everyday and i never leave without these first the comfort is exceptional even with my helmet on i never get uncomfortable with these in my ears i ve ridden miles at a time without any problems even when i need a break from the music i leave these in because they do such a great job of blocking wind and bike noise i ve used several other brands of canal earphones and none have been comfortable tolerable at best but most are painful with a helmet on the bulb you see in the picture rests in the crook of your ear so there is nothing extending past your ear to get crammed in deep second the sound quality is fantastic great bass mids and highs i ve heard things in my music i never knew was there and i can t wait to listen more i can t recommend these enough i ve bought a pair for my brother and may have to buy a pair for my wife because she keeps taking mine
1,i bought this high chair for my daughter s second birthday because i love the look of it the similar chair made by badger basket toys gets terrible reviews for being poorly constructed so i went with this one despite it having no reviews i couldn t be happier this high chair is solidly built and was easy to assemble i love the white finish because it will be relatively neutral as my daughter s room may go through decorative changes in the coming years i don t forsee her outgrowing this toy for quite a few years and it is sturdy enough to last she has several dolls the largest being her corolle lila who fits beautifully in the chair i would guess that this chair could possibly handle up to a doll while it is solidly built i am obviously discouraging my daughter from sitting in the chair herself i ve caught her trying to several times because no doll chair should be expected to be that sturdy the only real negative is the joke of a chair pad i actually just tossed it because it doesn t really add to the toy s play value anyway and would probably just be a nuisance i highly recommend this high chair for the child in your life who enjoys taking care of babies it s made me look to kidkraft for more toys and doll furniture
1,when my kids started kindergarten they needed to pack a lunch everyday my wife realized that this was a teaching opportunity about nutrition making the right choices and responsibility each day the kids pack their own lunches from lunch box central each lunch must contain a protein usually yogurt a grain some form of cracker or grain filled bar and a fruit apple banana or fruit cup envirokidz organic crispy rice bars are a staple in lunch box central they re convenient the kids enjoy them and they re a reasonably healthy choice the kids are happy they re learning and they re eating well my wife is pretty smart
1,i was very pleased with the socks they were just what we were looking for thanks so much
1,thirty five years ago my high school thomas jefferson in federal way washington held annual competitions in mathematics they did it in the form of a test that came bound in a small white booklet just was a few pages long there weren t many questions perhaps a dozen or two usually in the form of story problems but they required deep thought and concentration at least for me i still remember the feeling of excitement and trepidation as i took the white book and opened it to the first problem several hours later i d consider myself accomplished if i d managed to completely answer more than half the questions ian stewart s book reminds me of those tests here s a sampling of what s inside mrs anne lida worm decides she wants a new couch and tells mr worm to get it for her while she goes shopping for a new tight for baby wermintrude but anne lina doesn t want just any couch she wants the biggest possible couch that can be carried down the hall in their house and around the degree hall at the end what shape does the couch have and how big is it this is a truly riveting story will mr worm solve the couch problem in time alberto wants to conduct tests on grapes evaluating the influence of different soils he wants to conduct experiments to see how different soils and exposure to the sun affects the quality of wine his land is on a hillside though which is narrow so he can plant only three varieties of grape on each plot of land how can he arrange things so that he tests all seven varieties of grapes when they are arranged so that each plot contains exactly three different species where any two plots have exactly one variety in common and any two varieties lie in exactly one common plot sixteen chapters make up this book though their titles are whimsical the mathematical problems aren t some are still unsolved even though these problems fit in what would probably be called recreational mathematics they are fiendishly cleaver with solutions and developed insight along the way that are at once challenging and rewarding here s a sample of some of other topics discussed in stewart s book how might one transport a lion llama and head of lettuce in a boat across a lake without leaving any two species where one might eat the other in the absence of a caretaker how can you calculate the temperature and entropy of a curve how can one even talk sensibly about a curve having temperature and entropy in the first place suppose that you need to tile a room and the tiles come in odd shapes is there anyway to know if the tiling problem has a solution can mathematics tell us things about evolution such as whether or not evolution comes gradually or in spurts or both this is a fun lighthearted book but the mathematical problems and puzzles it discusses will really make you think i enjoy reading as i exercise on my elliptical machine i get double the sense of accomplishment when i can read and workout at the same time ordinarily i can estimate how long i ve been on the machine by how many pages i ve read pages in minutes is about average but with stewart s book i had to be careful several times i found that i d worked out for an hour and only managed to cover half a dozen pages or so if you love mathematics particularly mathematical puzzles then this is a book you ll really enjoy it has many problems for the reader with answers at the back of each chapter if you do the problems and understand everything in the book in detail it will occupy many hours of your time all in deep thought and utter enjoyment
1,good price good color selection i liked it better yet my mom loved it

1,my son received this toy as a present from his father on christmas dec and he was able to play with it straight out of the box i bought my son the v smile system and he can t use that as easily as he uses the read with me system while a agree with some of the previous reviews that this system would not take him to seven years old it does build his confidence level and keeps him motivated to keep playing because he was getting the answers right while with the v smile system he prefers i play and he watch so i am happy with this purchase and will buy more dvds for the system i have only one complaint and that is i wish they would use both traditional stories and use some of the newer characters my son loves thomas the train and even though he has the little engine that could i think he would also like to see thomas the tank engine dora the explorer and maybe even some books in foreign languages but all in all a great system for the younger preschool children
1,i received my package via ups in a reasonable amount of time the coffee itself is smooth and very flavorful but not fake tasting however i did waste a few pods trying to perfect the use for some reason a couple of cups came out really weak so i referred to the senseo handbook for a hint now when i put a pod in i make sure to smooth it out on top and make sure it is in evenly and snugly that seems to have solved the problem
0,halo on steroids halo is a clear microsoft stamp on bungie s creativity and control and it muddies up what was a balanced gameplay a hackneyed single player story that makes no sense and has no flow along with levels that aren t replayable you thought the library from was tedious try the headache inducing map design in this game also in the nonsense the unneccesary switch to an elite s perspective for half the game along with a new group of covenant bad guys that look like rejects from a captain planet cartoon apes with mohawks yeah nice design i can only play one or two levels of the single player and they are so noobish it loses appeal quickly on to multiplayer okay in upon release this was a great game it took time to go up in level and the ranking system wasn t as abused as it is now once new maps kept on the harddrive read mod kids were released by bungie that opened the door to full blown chaos now years later modding has died down somewhat but a whole new slew of bridging and connection speed manipulation makes it roughly likely you ll find a game with no lag so i still play on occasion it s lame they can t offer dedicated servers so you can play your map of choice choose servers with good connections and then the modders and big gun noobs can find the type of game they want to play too i only pray halo s multiplayer improves on this system otherwise i m done with the xbox console permanently

1,wow this album takes me back to the fall of around the same time as mj was taking over the world with his scorching solo debut off the wall both of these albums got heavy rotation on my turntable and were house party essentials when i was a yr old kid spinning the hot joints of the day at this time prince was still a virtual unknown to the mainstream but to a hip urban audience comprised mostly of blacks gays and ultra hip whites who really knew what time it was this lp served as notice that a new thang was brewin in minneapolis that was going to take the pop world by storm in a few short years from the opening track i wanna be your lover his first big single gold to the rockin why you wanna treat me so bad which also was a single and a true fan fave to sexy dancer which was sure to bring everybody to the dance floor and into a frenzy prince then cools down the mood with when we re dancing close and slow which is just beautiful with its sparse piano and acoustic string guitar one of his many underrated slow jams of all time then side opened with the pretty with you and into the scorching rockalistic ode to female bisexuality bambi which still knocks me for a loop i ve had the pleasure of seeing him perform this song live twice down through the years once in during his dirty mind tour and again in during his nude tour while i was overseas awesome then there s what i call the great triplicate still waiting another underrated slow classic followed by what is to me the definitive version of i feel for you no disrespect to the great chaka khan followed by another underrated slow jam masterpiece it s gonna be lonely which still sends me today at the same as it did when i first heard it at this album was prince s first platinum album proving that he at only was indeed a hitmaker and one to watch this album and the next one dirty mind served as a changing of the gaurd from the older established innovators of that day like stevie wonder earth wind fire and parliament funkadelic etc is an essential if your collecting prince classics in fact you can t go wrong with this kat between his debut s for you to s sign o the times it just doesn t get any better
1,over the years at various jobs i have seen this flashlight several times it is abused and subjected to the most terrible chemical and physical abuse it may end up looking beat up and yucky but they always work no matter what the contractor or whomever does to it if you need a reliable flashlight for the toolbox work truck pick up glove compartment etc this is the only one you need if you need a good flashlight at home and tired of buying and throwing out all those junky flashlights from the grocery store this one will be the last flashlight you will ever have to buy i finally bought one just for my home and i am only sorry i did not do this years ago i am also happy to have one of these things that is not totally beat up like the one in my toolbox i refuse to replace it i like this version because it has a strong magnet and you stick onto the refrigerator or the side of your truck i also like that it has switch guards so it will not be accidentally turned on because it is buried beneath of stuff in your toolbox one nit picky complaint it has a clip for a spare bulb behind the reflector however it comes empty and you have to supply your own so buy a spare bulb at the same time you buy this flashlight

0,i purchased this wide angle lens for my digital camera when i was experimenting with it taking photos inside my house there was a dark shadow in the lower right hand portion of the photo when i took a photo outside there was no shadow i went to my local camera shop to ask for help in this matter and he said i would need to adjust the white balance according to the light in the room but he said in reality these digital cameras are really not meant for attachments i did experiment with the light balance but still had no luck in getting that dark area to disappear the flash on the camera is not strong enough to compensate for the area the lens blocks i returned the product
0,the writing was not what i expect of andre norton too many gaps and information that is disjointed whether this is a consequence of collaboration i don t know i felt this should have had a strong editor to point out where things should be tightened for example at the start we know kirion has sent people to capture his sister the book covers over years but you hardly hear of this again i cannot imagine the sorcerer would just have let it drop i am a long time fan and retired children s librarian sic fi fantasy is my favorite genre but this one i had to push to finish unsatisfying

1,for many who like writing html xhtml code homesite holds a special place in the heart it just feels so right and is addictive the tool can be extended and the extensions use script which makes the development cycle dead easy support from macromedia has not been good now adobe is in the process of buying macromodia as on so who knows where it all goes saying that people who like this product still like it and prefer it if it fits you don t need support you just run it day after day and it works great there are alternatives emerging after all these years but none quite do it yet cse and topstyle are two that are coming along for some it almost seems perfect for wysiwyg oriented people it might be best not to even look at it

0,i really wanted these boots and had been contemplating getting them for almost months when they came i was so excited and took them out of the box to look at them and they were stained i was extremely disappointed that the product was defective because i have never had a problem with any amazon products in the past i sent it back and i was reimbursed for my purchase i am really disappointed i will think twice before i purchase any shoes from amazon again
0,the reading magnifiers i ordered finally arrived after a call to the seller original order was shipped to amazon com so it had to be reshipped to me it only took minutes or so to assemble one of the reading magnifiers and it is possible to adjust it to just about any position with the clever arm the weighted base does keep it from falling over unfortunately the thin plastic lense is such poor quality that it is very difficult to receive any benefit from the device if the user turned the adjustment knob too far it and the nut that holds it together would fall off the nut is small and must be inserted into the outside of the adjustment knob to assemble the device the knob actually turns the nut onto the screw presumably the device is for someone with low vision if the small nut falls to the floor i m not sure someone with low vision would be able to find it my advice is to save your money and buy a quality device with a nice glass lens and if possible try the device out before buying

0,when i was i loved this magazine it seemed so gown up to be reading this when my friends were still playing dolls now when i read it all i find is trash the magazine dosen t have one useful article in it unlike seventeen or cosmogirl there are no real life stories or health articles just trash about stars all the quizzes are the same thing they repeat and repeat and repeat and about the stars puh leeze i don t care if hilary duff is dating joel or not nor do i want to know if ashlee simson dies her hair herself or goes to a salon i don t reccomend this magazine to anyone if you have nothing to do than go ahead and read it but you won t enjoy it if you ve ever read a real magazine like seventeen or ellegirl

0,this is a very mediocre knights kingdom set there s not much of interest going on here and the small castle suffers from lazy design the colorful knights of morcia are back once again fighting against vladek the black knight two of the good knights make an appearance here blue and purple and we also get vladek a dark soldier and a skeleton the minifigs are as charismatic as ever each sporting his own unique expression vladek and his henchman have that cute i m evil lego frown our knights are outfitted with the usual accessories swords and shields and a black hatchet for the henchman the scene is a small mountainside castle that is home to a large scorpion monster the creature is constructed from a mixture of regular and technic parts and he has hinged pieces for an articulated tail and pincers the blue knight is accompanied by his horse who has a cute mini catapult strapped to his side the scorpion can fit into his den at the base of the castle which has a front gate that can be raised and lowered high atop the tower is a mini catapult and a thin boom crane with a small barred jail cell dangling precariously from it the rest of the castle is just walls floors and a staircase this castle is very fragile mine fell apart several times while i was working on building it on the whole the design just isn t all that great handle with care and play with care colors are mostly black dark gray dark red and brown this set has one of those nice walls with the barred window and some signature knights kingdom battlement pieces this set works as an addition to vladek s dark fortress on its own it s stunningly less impressive the good news is that a savvy lego maniac can take the castle parts and build a better castle with them my verdict one thumb up for the scorpion monster who can be added to your other knights kingdom adventures one thumb down for the rest could ve been better my advice is to get vladek s dark fortress it s more than worth the price of admission for those still hungering for more knights kingdom action after vladek s fortress has been built and conquered this set is better than nothing
1,we adopted a little boy when he was days old he was slightly preemie and weighed just over pounds he wouldn t have anything to do with the soothie for preemies but loved the regular soothie pacifier even though it covered half his face we had a hard time finding a bottle that he liked he didn t seem to care for any of the nipples and we tried several avent dr brown gerber and playtex i was strolling the baby aisle in target when i saw these and was thrilled in the store the pack of oz bottles was half of what they are here on amazon i love the width of the bottles because it s super easy to add in formula and make sure everything is really clean the lid also snaps onto the bottom which helps keep them from mysteriously disappearing our baby is now weeks old and these are still doing well this bottle has really cut down on the amount of mess our baby makes when eating also double check to make sure the top is on tight and you shouldn t have any leaking problems i m so glad i found these

1,flight from death is a must see documentary i saw it three times since i ve received the dvd last week and each time i discover new aspects images are beautiful and the commentary narrated by gabriel byrne is just outstanding before seeing it i was a little bit anxious to see how they can translate in a documentary the rather complex thought of ernest becker as a reader of becker s books for many years i can tell that patrick sean and greg bennick had done a fantastic job each important parts of becker s understanding of the impact of death anxiety on human behavior are explored and very well explained i understand now why this documentary won seven prizes please do not hesitate to buy this dvd you won t regret it

0,i ve always seen sheryl crow as a middle of the road rock artist my wife and i got a couple of her disc s plus that very best of cd and was really looking forward to her latest but this one zzzzzzzz makes me wonder what they re putting in sheryl s coffee some reviewers are saying there s heart and soul all over this album that may be but it s also very slick dullsville stuff too as for the album cover graphics i don t see the roger dean yes covers or the s style psychedelia like one reviewer wrote but a very modern graphic art that lots of artists and bands have been using kelly clarkson the vines the donnas the list goes on highlights good is good i guess it s time for a new very best of collection
0,i recently purchased this model to replace an older panasonic model that i loved for years this new model is simply horrible and is a completely unacceptable replacement it s nice and quiet and i m sure the vacuum works great but i wouldn t know since the blades would not cut the hairs i was trying to trim we re talking about hairs easily in length a trimmer should be able to shave those down don t you think if the hair was longer than that i could have used scissors don t bother even trying this product it s a waste of money
1,xenosaga ii jenseits von gut und boese came in november to europe and was the first xenosaga which was released here but we european players never played xenosaga i before so namco released the second xenosaga in a great special box in this box was the game itself and a movie dvd with nearly all xenosaga i movies back to topic in my opinion xenosaga ii is a pretty game with cool movies and a battle system that makes fun the music in this game was composed from yuki kajiura in the movies and shinji hosoe in the rest of the game i think kajiuras music is really good but shinji hosoe did a bad job with his elevator music o the graphics are okay but i couldn t see anything outstanding in the end i must say that xenosaga ii is a good rpg even if it s not so wonderful than the first xenosaga that s the reason why i imported xenosaga i from your country but at last the most pal players are happy that actually my dictionary doesn t give me the right english translation for ueberhaupt sorry xenosaga ii come to europe yet so i look forward to the third and last xenosaga and hope that this episode will be like the first many greets from germany viele gruee aus deutschland
0,this publication has no business calling itself a magazine published by san diego book distributor american marketing servies this is nothing more than a fluffy info mercial for its clients and publishers they want to woo don t waste your money
0,with the phenomenal success of the poseidon adventure the first disaster movie of its kind the sequel was sure to be a hit not so a plot containing two rival treasure salvagers combined with survivors still on board sounded great having a leading lady sally fields fresh from an oscar win and a few veteran actors michael caine karl malden might also sound promising unfortunately the magic of the set production of the original is not even close instead of upside ballrooms barber shops kitchens and bathrooms the audience is presented with storage rooms simply full of boxes the rest of the cast is comprised of television actors who are as wooden as the script there s no tension and some of the lines are so incredibly ridiculous you won t even laugh in disbelief irwin allen had gold slip right through his fingers with this very promising sequel considering the original that s a terrible shame
0,when john cipollina was in the lineup and he and rhythm guitarist gary duncan were in the groove there was no better sounding group than qms cipollina s talent was awe inspiring unfortunately one of quicksilver s overbearing and domineering members ways led to cipollina s departure without cipollina qms sounded like just another mediocre rock group despite the talents of duncan freiberg and elmore i saw them at the hollywood palladium years ago and can verify this if you want to hear them at their best buy the album happy trails or lost gold and silver

1,if you want a subtle piece of jewelry that will get attention this is it i have gotten more compliments and questions from strangers when i wear these earrings and pendant than i have from all the swarovski jewelry i have created and worn this is a very different color than i have ever worked with it appears as if two sides only are ab and the other two aren t quite unusual which makes it fun
0,the dolls and outfits in this set are adorable and the case was a cute idea the only problem that kept me from giving this item a high star rating is the case itself i wish the case closed more tightly it closes with a small gap along the sides also the entire case lid keeps coming off easily overall tho aside from the annoyance of the lid for the price it was still worth purchasing because as i ve said the dolls and outfits are so adorable and a great addition to my old daughters polly collection
0,the seam came apart and the gel leaked out in the first months the non skid underside surface has a peculiar and distinctly unpleasant smell
1,i have sticked with sony since i got my first digital camera years ago and sony camera has been the moneys worth this one dsc is the one for the parent who is carrying to much already and needs to pack down for a change it fits in my purse and still have space for more the only thing to remember to buy a slim fitting case for the camera and an extra battery for those kind of battery are not sold everywhere you need that one when you don t thing you need an extra battery you always run out at the wrong time i recommend this one
1,i take a ringside boxing class at my gym and everyone bought these gloves and really likes them i ordered them from online because it was the only place i could find a size small i am very happy with them they offer excellent wrist support and protection for your fingers i really like the bar in the palm to help you grip when making a fist they do tend to leave your hands a little black after sweating in them but it washes right off the only thing bad i have to say is that after only a couple of times of using them the threading started to come apart at the pinky finger it can be sewed up but you shouldn t have to do that so soon after the purchase no one else in my class seems to have had this problem i still gave them stars because i have a hunch that the threading isn t a common problem and i love them otherwise
1,typical of central italy this sauce has the characteristic of being hot after all arrabbiata means mad in italian although tolerance to spiciness is very subjective this sauce will not overwhelm your palate enjoy this beautiful blend of flavors the freshness of parsley a hint of hand picked organic marjoram and the madness of the habanero recipe suggestions excellent as a dip for shrimp or chips spicy and delicious over tacos quesadillas or any mexican dish unexpectedly delicious over chicken cutlet or poached fish grilled vegetables au gratin or sautéed portabella mushroom we ve also added it to a seafood bouillabaisse for a fantastic dinner party idea
0,my daughter is almost three and she was so excited when she received this for christmas unfortunately the strings do not work and also the star buttons are supposed to play notes and or chords and they don t work either i was going to send for a replacement because my daugher absolutely loves this and i was so disappointed when amazon responded there are no replacements available i m going to see if the manufacturer can replace it

0,to say that this mat is very slippery is an understatement it is basically unuseable i wound up throwing it aside the first time i tried it out a complete waste of money
1,if you must have a cookie might as well make it a healthy one i bought a case and they went fast
1,everything about the sonos worked as advertised it was a snap to set up and it is slicker than i anticipated the interface is commonsense and well thought out it is the only decent solution for tying together multiple discrete sound systems within a house to play the same music simultaneously you can also play different music all obtained from the same computer source or internet radio it is one of those rare products that instead of disappointing actually packs many pleasant surprises
1,this book is a five star book i love it so much partly becuase i like mystery adventurous books and i would recommend this to all of the people who like mystery adventure it is a great book about a great family when everything goes wrong when janie jonhson decides she wants to drink milk and when she looks at the back for the kidnapped kid she learns too much
1,a lot of tv for little money great picture and the refresh rate is fast enough to prevent most of the blurring that you tend to see on low end lcd s initial setup can be tricky because olevia chose to include a cd version of the operators manual though you can print a paper version from the cd or olevia website better than average sound but the side speakers add a bit to the overall width after tweaking the factory settings we achieved a nice color balance without any of the black level problems that plague many lcd s if you re using it in a bedroom you ll most likely be annoyed by the very bright on off light on the front panel rear panel connections are intuitive and easily accessible and wall hanging was a breeze looked at many lcd televisions and there are better choices for sure but it s hard to beat the performance of this set at the low price highly satisfied
1,i read the review centering on the box the dvd comes in and must admit that i was stumped as well it was different but i don t foresee this as being a problem overall the new office ultimate loaded quickly how quickly well i had to check my new vista hp notebook because i couldn t believe that it packed all of the programs onto the system in such a short amount of time it asked for the product key and one or two other bits of data but that was it out of all the office suites i have owned this one loaded so quickly i was sure there was a problem nope access outlook word powerpoint publisher onenote excel groove and a host of others were there ready to be activated don t worry you only do it once not for each separate program naturally if you are like me and totally dependent upon email you ll activate outlook first the new office feels different the ribbons are ok but i would suggest that they allow us the option to retain the classic xp view i rely quite a bit on the research task pane and i don t mind telling you that it was difficult to find the menu bar is a bit on the thin side and having so many icons on the top added clutter and confusion at least for me of course finding the research task pane could have been quickly resolved if microsoft had put a product manual in the box yes the online help is nifty but sometimes a man just needs to read about it from a manual instead of printing it out all in all you will find all of your old favorites and true to the office legacy they really have not changed enough to warrant a major release but i m willing to bet that after all is said and done office ultimatae will become the industry standard
0,i am a fan of historical fiction and this has to be one of the most historically inaccurate films i have ever seen what bothers me the most is that the general public who hasn t read the tudor biographies like some of us have will believe this stuff because it is their only exposure to the subject i won t go into all the inaccuracies since other reviewers have already touched on them why tamper with history when it was actually more fascinating than what was portrayed in this movie
1,i love anakin skywalk

0,i installed quickbooks pro on my new computer running vista and had a small problem so i bought an upgrade to since intuit says it works with vista it does not the software crashes at odd times it also crashes when attempting to call up invoices from the accounts receivable report it reports out of memory errors and closes two to six times each day i have set up my old computer which runs xp so i can use the new software until they fix all of the glitches in the version i recommend not buying this version if you are running vista os

1,yeah some of the stuff is way too pricey for me but there are some really great ideas and articles in this magazine i have the march april issue and among my favorites this month are an article about how to diplomatically discipline other people s kids a gifted child who was misdiagnosed with autism best adult friendly children s music to download and suggestions for artistic children s books furthermore there is a price range for suggested products some of which would fit most people s budgets an article on make up features products from there is also an article on how to make a room habitable for children which is hardly targeted towards people who live in huge estates do you buy vogue magazine and expect to be able to afford everything in it it s not for some people but it is for me and i hope it does well

1,i have tried many types of stainless steel cleaners this is the best i have found i actually saw it in a dept store and they were using it for the cleaner it was not available for purchase there i have only found it on line it is well worth the price several of my friends and neighbors have switched to it now too it really cleans without streaks it lasts a long time too love my stainless but it requires a good cleaning product like this one
1,although not the model and style requested by my son my musical background lead me to review and purchase this guitar instead it is of fine quality and my son is thrilled by his christmas gift
1,the first time i saw the film was when i saw it in the sale in virgin mega stores so i picked it up and put it on straight away a soon as i got home and i was totally amazed with crawfords wonderful performance and also was amazed with hustons performance too in rain crawford plays a prostertute called sadie tompson who has ran away form her old life in san francisco but as soon as she arrives at this hotel at pongo pongo she already gets into trouble as soon as she enters the hotel by this preachers wife but later she has a run in with the preacher huston which isn t good for her huston hypnotises her with prayers and it makes her want to go to san francisco but huston in the ends slashes his throat and sadie turns back to normal its one of the best films crawford has ever made

1,i bought the sr after a lenghty review on the internet my goal was to find the best available headphones for a low budget around i have been very satisfied with the sr the sound is great confort is incredible since sound is not contained they may be somewhat annoying for surrounding non listeners so if you are looking for first quality sound low budget headphones and don t care to much about the looks these are the ones to go with
1,the response was very fast the item came as advertised it works on my mac very nicely
0,i was excited to play this game because i wanted to play a detective like game unfortunately this game is very kid like here s an example the first non auto generated task is to solve some puzzles for a guy these are the simple kind of puzzles you could find in a children s word game book i easily got all of them except meaning i couldn t progress past this point no problem for me because by this time i didn t want to i m not saying it s a bad game it s just probably not a good game for grownups
0,a woman who lives in an apartment in nyc and can t cook and doesn t have a baby must fool the owner of her magazine into thinking she really is the character she writes about she writes a very popular domestic advice column she succeeds until a navy hero wins the opportunity to spend christmas with her in her house in connecticut enjoying her homemaking skills and meeting her baby problem is she doesn t have any of those things she borrows the house from a man who wants to marry her she borrows the cooking skills of a sweet grandfatherly chef who secretly cooks for her at the house and she even borrows a baby the unmaking beings when she tells the navy man her child is a boy and when he volunteers to give it a bath he discovers it s really a girl then the mother of the baby takes it back and the baby is replaced by a baby who looks nothing like the first one then the woman is falling in love with the navy man and he with her while the man from whom she s borrowed the house still believes she s going to marry him and keeps bringing a minister to the house for a quickie wedding it s a delightful movie very funny and rich in both plot and character development unfortunately what probably makes it not a classic by today s standards it is a bit plodding it does not move at the same pace as for example the movie casablanca with which it shares some of the same supporting actors
1,this car charger does what it is spposed to do and the price is right
0,though the design is cool the quality of this pendant is poor they are so light and the color is strikingly white which makes them appear cheaper they look like toys i also bought the earrings set with the same design and i m so disappointed with both only the packaging is of good quality in this product i suggest that amazon collection makes white gold of a good quality with the similar design

1,half life made its debut in and it shocked the entire world half life at the time featured stunning graphics gameplay and sound it was simply one of those games that had to be in every gamers hands and still to this date half life is a game that every action game developing company carefully needs to study in order for their games to be a success shortly after the release and once the gasp from the world has ended two game developers joined together to create a game that not gasped the world again but made it scream the game pits terrorists and counter terrorists in a fast paced sort of s w a t type of tactical firefighting gameplay matches can consist of one of two types of game types the first and probably the most popular type is bomb defusal in both of the game types you can win by either eliminating the opposing team or following the objective in bomb defusal a random player on the team will receive the bomb each round the player can plant the bomb in one of two bomb spots or simply drop the bomb for another teammate to pick it up and use it once the bomb is planted the counter terrorists must defuse it regardless if the terrorists have been eliminated the counter terrorists usually have about thirty five seconds to defuse the bomb and win the round the second type of gameplay is hostage rescue the terrorists must protect four hostages in an area of the map from the counter terrorists rescuing them and taking them to their base if the hostages are killed by the terrorists or counter terrorists nothing will happen except that now the counter terrorists must completely kill the terrorists to gain victory in the round at the start of each round all players have a few seconds to quickly buy weapons with the money they have achieved from past rounds by victories both teams have a significant difference in the arsenal of weapons you can choose from but neither really focuses on a specific time of gun style all of the weapons in the game are one hundred percent realistic and deadly as in reality this is an element that makes counter strike such a superior game counter strike is without argument the most popular online action game in the world an entire culture has formed around it so what makes it such an extremely addictive and popular game it is purely because of the fantastically well crafted gameplay and not the graphics or the game would not be as popular as it is players around the world will give you many deep reasons why it is such a great game but one without argument stands out it is simply the fact that versus other games it is difficult to make a kill in the game what makes the game so addicting is the pleasure of killing someone after a long thirty second gunfight or a quick shot to the head knowing that the dead player is now experiencing some form of anger as he waits out the rest of the round another element is how realistic the guns feel in the game regardless if they are fake and the shooting has been totally simulated it has been superiorly well done and definitely once a new player to the game has gained enough experience to achieve kills at least periodically a feeling of power will be experienced when holding an ak or an the game is quite punishing to new players and a total hapzard to players who have never played first person shooters or video games at all but regardless the stress you feel at first there is absolutely no reason to put down the game because of the entry difficulty as it is almost guaranteed you will get better in the game there are over ten maps in the game and each one has been done as a masterpiece all of the maps wildly differ from each other in the feel of action and even the environment the most popular of all the maps de that has been created by davej is still commonly referenced in many gaming parodies magazines shows etc due to its style and simplicity it is a godly designed map and arguably the most popular map in first person shooter history one thing that helps to fight a player of being bored of the game is simply the maps since each map has been superbly designed a player could easily switch to another one after being bored and continue on with play and with a different feel the game also has many public map editors which parties can use to create custom maps fy iceworld and awp map are some very popular maps that have been created by amateur designers this makes counter strike a game with an almost infinite value sort of feel the sound in counter strike is absolutely insanely realistic the first time a player plays or even watches another player play the game the person will definitely without a doubt notice the clear sounds of ak fire or pistol fire not much is known why the guns sound so realistic and the player s best guess is that the designers have actually recorded live gunfire of the weapons the sound of the weapons combined with the look and feel end up making the player totally immersed into the game and with a feeling of power this sort of thing is extremely rare in video game at the time counter strike had simply jaw dropping graphics created all from the half life engine players were amazed at the lighting effects and how clear the textures were at the present the game doesn t hold the same but it is what in the past has mattered half life was one of the first games in history to have some slightly complex and dynamic physics the bouncing of a flashbang or a player being blown away was also something at the time to look at games before the release of half life hardly had any sort of physics and if they did it would be something very basic counter strike is a game that without argument should be on any player s hard drive there are still even thousands of players that since from the release of the game back at still actually play the game without losing an ounce of boredom counter strike will forever be played and is the heart of all action games from the past present and the future

1,best price i saw for this doll and it came in the mail in a very short time wrapped securely i love when you can shop online beat the crowds and get quality merchandise beautiful doll too
1,i really liked this film it s not a groundbreaking movie in any way though it s about a bunch of underdog kids who aren t interested in football until a coach comes along and changes their minds throughout the movie we see the kids working out and trying hard to prepare for the match against the other more talented and unlikeable team it s pretty much the same thing we ve seen in the mighty ducks except now it s about football it s just a typical family movie that sends the message to children that even if you re small and think you don t have any talent you actually do have the talent to play football hockey basketball whatever one of the characters is a girl who doesn t know if she wants to play football with the boys or be a cheerleader like all the other girls rick moranis once again plays that shy quiet character he does so well in other films such as honey i shrunk the kids it s hard to believe he s now a country singer no i m not kidding ed o neil doesn t quite play the jerk character you d expect from the married with children show he s not really a nice guy either though i find it interesting that the team names are the giants the good guys vs the cowboys the bad guys because the monday night football game this week were those two teams facing each other with the giants winning
1,shadowbred by paul kemp is simply an excellent book the story is incredibly engrossing the atmosphere set for each scene is really top notch and the journey paul takes his character s through is really incredible we see personal demons and struggles of the heroes struggles with faith the journey of an anti hero to a hero and whether he can really make this journey the villains are equally deep and interesting and frankly human if you are a fan of fantasy literature definitely pick this one up you won t regret it as a side note you might want to pick up the previous books by paul featuring erevis cale as well
1,i purchased these skates for my grand daughter and she just loves these skates i thought that with her being only years old she would not be able to pop out the wheels but she did it and off she went she tries to wear these skates everywhere
0,oh man this sucks really bad good thing nu metal is dead thrash metal is real metal this is for posers
0,like most people who made the effort to see this movie i read tim sandlin s book and thoroughly enjoyed it unfortunately for this movie sandlin is a far better novelist than screenwriter the film is disjointed awkward and hard to follow it quickly hops from one important moment of the book to another allowing almost no time to understand the characters and their motivations or appreciate the bizarre circumstances of the story the casting isn t bad a prepubescent mischa barton was a fine choice a hysterical one for fans of the o c and jennifer jason leigh is also respectable although she doesn t fit her character s physical description but that doesn t nearly make up for the film s jumpy direction and half baked plot in sum this is a dissatisfying and substandard film undoubtedly the subject matter is better suited for a novel and sandlin s humor and talents are better utilized there read his books avoid this movie
0,by reading the cover i thought it would be a great product to have it indeed has some good items but overall this is something one can live without games bowling game is actually a teaser version you can play only two lanes others cost you extra two other games are not exciting themes and screen savers are mediocre i liked the analog convertor but not too much if you can get input from any audio device this program can convert it into a digital format alas it doesn t convert to format also you need to keep computer completely free of other load while recording otherwise songs will be recorded slow or fast but not on the normal speed dancers can provide some entertainment to young kids for two minutes but soon they find out that these dancers have canned actions i liked ben though especially when he gets tired of dancing bottom line i don t think you would regret buying this at dollars but the novelty will wear off within a week
1,i used this to help plan kitchen and bathroom makeovers it helped me see just what we wanted
0,to me this game was seriously disappointing so disappointing i didn t finish the second case before setting it down forever i was highly entertained at first it s cute funny and going around clicking on things for a new ds user was highly entertaining however it quickly got older you can t skip through the horrendously long dialog ever even after you ve heard it about a million times because you re clicking on people hopelessly in frustration unable to figure out what to do i found myself looking for an internet walk through yes on this simplistic game i couldn t figure out what to click and wandering around hopelessly for thirty minutes reading over dialog you ve read a thousand times just gets too frustrating even for my typical patience level possible spolier there seemed to be a glich in the second story in which i talked to the wrong person at the wrong time and then i could never get a ticket into the planetarium after that i just couldn t take it any more and gave up the places and people never change for each case from my understanding it s all the exact same tiny few places i m not a big gamer but i like a world bigger than three feet i let a friend borrow it and thus far she is enjoying it more than me just to help this review i m a college age female and this is my first gaming console although i ve played the quite a bit maybe it s really a hit or miss but i don t really recommend it for anyone but someone with a high patience level a really high patience level
1,i have enjoyed using my camera i have been able to get some great pictures the stabilization feature work well
0,i purchased these monitors thinking i wouldn t need to use them at all since the baby s room is right next door i m glad i did buy them because my son ended up with acid reflux and spit up in his sleep constantly for awhile there so being able to hear him and go to him is a comfort anyways there are only channels on these monitors which is a bummer since i live in a big apartment complex i get interference of all kinds from telephone conversations to other people s babies crying which really weirded me out the first time i heard it i tried using a battery with it when i brought it with me to check the mail yes the door was locked no i am not a bad mother and was only able to hear static i wish i had bought a monitor with more channels note to self keep reciepts and packaging from now on
0,i am terribly disappointed with my razr phone i purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the only positive features the viewing screen is so small that i can t even read the time and it does not give the option to use larger font size the battery dies about three hours after being charged even if i haven t used the phone it does not give me the ability to automatically call back someone who left a message unless that person also has verizon service i am forced to enter a code in order to hear my messages and i can t find any way change this i wish i had my old sprint phone again
0,we bought three of these for christmas presents and two of them stopped working already they won t turn on at all one of them broke almost immediately and philips sent a refurbished unit to replace it that one is now broken too the units have not been dropped or mistreated in any way
0,this is the most innacurate thermometer i have ever come across each reading seems to increase or drop by degree or more moreover the battery only lasts for uses granted one needs to take readings to get a general idea of the correct temperature but you would think the battery could last a few more times when you have a sick child accuracy and time are of the essence

0,these boots look good on the first wear i bought the black patent boots and after one not so wild night they scuffed and had sveral little tears in the material if you need boots for one night for that perfect outfit these will suffice

1,i first saw this webundies outfit when my friend sara brought them to our lingerie party and i have to admit with all the other hot looking stuff there i didn t have too much hope for these well was i ever wrong you don t need to be skimpy and revealing to be attractive to your man these will do the trick if your guy hasn t been paying you the kind of attention you ve been wanting get a pair of these wear them to bed like pjs climb under the covers roll over pretend to go to sleep i m betting he won t let ya

0,i am a parent of a year old daughter who loves dolls she was given the love me chou chou doll for christmas on christmas day we were unable to get the doll to fall asleep so on i went back to the store to exchange the doll with no luck i found that the second doll would not fall asleep either i looked on the zapf creation web site under most frequently asked questions and received more instructions on how to get the doll to fall asleep and still the doll will not fall asleep apparently this is a problem not only with the doll my daughter has but with other customers as well if the company knows that this is one of the most frequently asked questions why not remodel the doll so she can fall asleep like the instructions say it is very discouraging for a year old who has hopes of seeing the doll do something that is being advertised and it does not do that it is also very upsetting to a parent who has to continue going back and forth to a store and hopes of looking for a working doll these dolls are very expensive and should work like the instructions say they should we have tried everything we can to get the love me chou chou doll to fall asleep and nothing seems to make that happen i have even spoken with another parent in the store where the doll was purchased and was advised her daughter also was crying on christmas day because they could not get the doll to fall asleep she then explained she had her mother a grandmother to rock the doll and guess what the doll finally fell asleep keep in mind this was not rock a bye chou chou we have even tried to rock this doll with no luck of getting the doll to fall asleep i have even taken the doll back to the store for an exchange but was advised the doll is no longer being sold at the store where i purchased it
1,i m not sure about all that other nonsense the reviewer before me is talking about sounds like someone with an axe to grind but this album is a stunning piece of workmanship the music is inspired the melodies transcending and the emotion deep and meaningful as far as copying yanni goes well i don t agree in fact yanni is far more generic and less inspired the sound samples the cranky reviewer alludes to are in fact not the same nor are they yanni s creation i write this review to commend mr farish on his work and to take to task the idiot who misinformed others and couldn t resist his own urge to see his critique in print ryans music is distinctly his own no question and any similarities are tonal and not compositional which the reveiwer would be well advised to take note of as far as i m concerned you be the judge and let cranky wannabe music critics continue to wallow in their own self hate as they surf store shelve s and websites for music to criticize and well make themselves feel a little better personally i would recommend this album to anyone who likes strong songs with great production and uplifting energy all the other stuff is for hacks enjoy this music i do
0,i waited months for this game to come out i can t add anymore than what has been said by others i wonder how hands on sid was with it could be a long time before any great train game will be coming out if ever

1,i use this all of the time it gives good protection ease of use and good handling only disadvantage is that you can not keep it on when putting the unit in a vetical dock however this is true of any protective skin outstanding product
0,liked this magazine enough to order it but it gets one star for wasting my money thought it d be simple enough to order it from amazon like i do everything else but instead i ve paid and never received it i haven t been able to log a compaint with amazon cause every time i do it links me somewhere else so this is the first chance i ve had to even say i ve been ripped off they may eventually send it but it s not likely at this point it s been a couple months now
1,i recently purchased an pack of these batteries knowing that my palm would eat them up right away what a surprise i have had these batteries for over a month and they still have not been below if that sounds too good get this these batteries lasted the whole entire band trip under strenuous use and the battery meter didn t even dip below i would definetly recommend this product for people with palm pilots
1,so often when looking through magazines i haven t found quite what i was looking for in the christian literature i like the approach christianity today takes it has articles that are broad and not focused on a specific demonination i believe the magazine has a slight evangelical bent to it i do like the variety of articles and coverage of current events i would recommend this magazine for those who want to become a little more informed of christianity in the modern world
1,an excellent product fits my grill perfectly easy to put on and take off looks like a winner one small sewing flaw but otherwise well mad
0,i cannot speak for all devices but this was a total failure in my case i am a fast typist and it seemed that about of the keystrokes were not picked up by my treo this was simply unacceptable so i immediately returned it i cannot determine whether the problem was due to the keyboard the software or my old pda newer faster pdas might have a better success rate but the potential for problems will still be there my suggestion is to buy this somewhere with a generous return policy so that you can return it if it is a mismatch for your pda
0,the camera operates good but i thought it was suppose to be new it looked a bit used and was cracked on the bottom it does work but unfortunately all the packageing was tossed out
0,i thought this product had reasonably good taste but i have two major issues with it first they describe this as a kettle corn it is not kettle corn not even close this is a caramel corn with a thick sweet coating real kettle corn is a slightly sweet slightly salty popcorn second each very small bag has servings in it when was the last time you opened a small bag of snack food and only ate s of it they purposely made the serving size unrealistic to make it look healthier the whole point of paying for individual size bags is that it limits you to a set portion remember when a can of coke had servings in it the fda made them change the label if you eat the whole bag you are eating calories of popcorn no better that a bag of potato chips or a few cookies so this is not a lesser evil it s just the same old junk food with a new name i won t buy this product again it s the same stuff you can get anywhere
0,this is a very fun toy there are numerous buttons and sounds that my children enjoyed very much after you close the phone it rings a couple seconds later and the kids loved to answer it and pretend to talk to people unfortunately the two i bought quit working within a short time of buying them i bought the first one last year for my son and it lasted for about a week first the recording feature stopped working then none of the sounds worked new batteries didn t help i even opened it up to see if any transistors had burned out or there were any shorts didn t find any problems it just refused to work we bought a second one for christmas and it s already quit too we ll try to stay away from this brand
1,whoa this cd rocks one of my favorite anti flag albums for sure this cd may not be what some of the harder punk fans want from anti flag but i think it also shows they re growth as a band they can play more than just really loud hard punk though they play that awesome too some of the songs on this album incredibly powerful and some are really catchy too war sucks lets party is a great anarchist anthem and one trillion dollars is amazingly moving i mean seriously trillion spent on weapons around the world in every track is good and has its own message they seem to have no problem coming up w new songs there are so many things to ridicule in our gov i just wish that more people would listen to this band s message peace and lov

0,i really tried to like this game being that ea chickened out and bought their way out of competition the graphics and sound are great in this game but its ruined by ea s cheating ai i have never seen a game cheat this much in my life no matter what play you call the defense always knows what you are calling even if you think you have them beat on a play your receiver will purposely drop a wide open pass or better yet the defender turns on his nitrous oxide that was installed in his uniform and cover half the field in seconds to deflect a pass if you throw a high pass not to worry the lineman has installed jet packs which allows them to jump feet in the air and deflect or pick off your pass if the cpu wants you to lose you will lose no matter what you do if you qb is going back for a pass and a lineman is feet away from you even if you press the passing button your qb will just stand there so he can take a sack this game is total bs there is no way to get off passes in heavy pressure becuase the game forces you into a tackle animation when you are playing defense you are better off putting down your controller and clipping your nails or flossing your teeth while the cpu pulls of bs miracle plays on every single down remember how i said your receivers will purposely drop wide open passes not the cpu receivers the cpu receivers regardless of their rating can catch passes in double and triple coverage every time if they don t catch it the ball just gets tipped over and over again until he can catch it think you stopped a down conversion think again you will get flagged for pass interference or a face mask penatly and remember about your qb being forced into a tackle animation not the cpu the cpu can get of yard spirals while he s being hit what about the inconsistency you ask well let me explain how is it that one game you can be totally on but the next game you can t even complete one pass i ll tell you why the cpu wants you to lose so you will drop every pass fumble every run and get called for every penalty in the book i was playing a game and managed to run back a punt and kr for a td before my offense even touched the field then all of a sudden the cpu turned on its god mode and every thing went right for the cpu bs lobs bs runs and bs calls i did not complete one single pass in the entire first half its not because the cpu was playing good defense its because my receivers dropped every ball that was thrown to them wide open or not i ended up only completing one pass in the entire game for i think at this point i knew i had no chance of winning so i just started punting the ball on first down to avoid any more frustration my so called impact rb only got yards on rushes and my so called impact cb gave up td passes to a below average receiver what is the point of playing if you are not even given a chance to win yes you can win games as i have but it is so inconsistent if the cpu wants you to lose you will lose nothing you can do about it i see why ea bought the license after putting out crap like this they were sure to lose a lot of customers to a game that knows how to develop better ai instead of this cheating crap i am taking this game to the store for store credit and i am done with ea for good ea sucks and so does this game

0,this is not a book i would recomend for anyone serious interested in rune casting it tells nothing of the history of runes and it seems if the writer figured out what tarot card closely matches each rune and then wrote the book based off that info there are much better books out there for rune casting
0,i ve only been on a gluten free diet for four months so maybe my palate has not yet become accustomed to things that taste horrid the worst part is that amazon has left me stuck with six loaves of this i d put it out for the squirrels but i m not sure they d eat it if you re expecting something that tastes anything like bread you re in for a shock
0,seriously i was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet it was all i use to play online after purchasing this game and playing it for all of minutes i quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since online play was non existent everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist it was ridiculus letting someone else create this game instead of infinity ward was a giant mistake this latest edition adds nothing to the series do not purchase this game there are many better games out there

0,i am very dissapointed with the band on this watch the band absorbs and holds moisture the last thing i want while exercising is a sopping wet watch band around my wrist this could cause irration and a rash what was the designer thinking moreover even when dry the band is rough to the skin and not comfortable to wear i have liked timex watches and felt the company was innovative and thoughtful in its watch designs this watch band is neither innovative nor thoughtful in its design i don t even want to wear this watch i really don t think i should have to buy a new watch band for my brand new watch furthermore timex customer service is like dealing with a bunch of idiots it is as if they read about words of your email and then reply i guess they think that if they keep feeding you stupid answers long enough you ll eventually go awa
0,okay so in the beginning i was so excited about this perfume it smelled amazing and the scent lasted forever when i say forever literally forever you spray it on after your shower in the afternoon and then go to sleep it lasts until the next afternoon it s not even just a weak scent that s left on you it s like as if you ve been spraying it constantly but here s the bad part after using it for awhile i felt sick in the stomach becuase the scent was so strong i felt like the scent was a little too deep it s great for people who like strong distinct scents if not though this isn t the product for you

1,i bought this shirt as a gift for my husband he loves it it s comfortable fits well and looks new after multiple washings along with my husband being happy i am very pleased with the service of amazon com i ordered one item from shop com it took more days then what they told me it would arrive and when i got the watch it wasn t the watch that i ordered they don t even sell the watch they were advertising to top it off their customer service was not good when i called amazon s customer service they were very helpful and nice therefore you can understand how much i appreciated that the multiple items i ordered from amazon were delivered in a shorter time then estimated the products were all great and the service was great

1,we ve only had ours a week and i wish we d bought it sooner the photos are sharp and every bit as good as commercially printed ones i like it that they are dry and can be handled right away unlike my big hp printer s photos which stay sticky for some time having this gives such freedom to print and print photos to enclose in letters to use in scrapbooking and to frame for your home or for gifts really convenient and takes very little space on the desktop

1,would someone be able to give me the dimensions measurements for this mattress thanks so much i do not have this however it made me put in a rating in order to post a question
1,this bed is great because our bedroom is small and the bed fits nicely next to my bed it feels so good knowing he s so close its really convienent because we have to leave town for a night and this bed folds up small enough to throw in the trunk and he will still feel at home when he sleeps oh yeah and its really cute
1,product is ok don t think it d protect you phone if you dropped it while standing up but it is aesthetically appealing will protect from small scuffs and scrathes
0,this camera is incredibly frustrating i must admit that under ideal lighting conditions outdoors on a moderate to fully sunny day the camera takes wonderful pictures however photos using indooor and mixed lighting conditions leave alot to be desired if you want to take any indoor pictures with natural light this is not the camera for you the reason being is that if the flash is not activated or the lighting is not perfect the camera slows down the shutter speed considerably since the camera does not have very good image stabilization if any indoor pictures are blurry unless you have the hands of a surgeon of course you can use the flash but then your subject will be overlit while the background is pitch dark and forget about taking long range pictures indoors i e at a graduation ceremony or wedding because if the flash is on you will get a black picture because the camera does not compensate the shutter speed for distance it only adjusts to whether or not it thinks the flash is on if it is off your picture will be blurred because the shutter stays open for seconds since i take alot of indoor pictures this camera is worthless to me if you only plan to take outdoor pictures in ideal light this is the camera for you if you want to do any natural light photography forget it
1,i was shocked at the different sounds this thing makes after just a few minutes the chorus sound was totall amazing like a nice fluid bright string totally a cool toy for
1,i recommend this cd to anyone stuck in a rut like i was listening to the same artists over and over but wanting something new and fresh life on planet groove will be a welcome addition to your collection great for the drive
1,well its definetly improved version since the last one but they still have a lot of things to do the biggest problem is pages if text has specific symbols like greek letters and u try to export your file to doc forget it u ll have the same problem as yrs ago either funky symbols or underline dashes keynote is much better but if u r a scientist and not a sales man both packages still have a lot of room for improvement however i m still happy with this purchase because it s apple soft and looks much nicer than any ms software will get in the future
0,unfortunately my experience was completely different starting with the unprofessional shipping shaver and components were shipped in a box stuffed with old newspapers instead of professional packing material shaver and trimmer are almost exactly lifesize in the screenshot on this page i felt mislead by the pictures another person said how impressive the shaver is i had the exact opposite experience i picked it up and i was more than underwhelmed the shaver is about the size of a saltshaker and the battery accounts for the weight not the motor not to be mean but the shaver reminds me of something i might pickup in a cents store the other day i found a far better shaver from remington for about in my local raley s store of course to find out about this seiko shaver first hand you ll need to open the shrink wrap which then in turns makes it almost moot to return the item because donner charges a sanitary disposal fee if you open the item on top of that the shipping charges are also non refundable on the other hand if i return the grocery store shaver to the store i d get a full refund if i m not happy with the product ok so how well does it shave not bad but also not any better than the shaver from my grocery store the blade component seems extremely flimsy essentially tiny blades stuck to a piece of plastic and if you do decide to use this shaver you ll be ordering replacement blades in no time all in all i was not happy with my purchase in the least spent on something that should be around
1,i am not a photographer but i enjoy taking good pictures i never had a digital slr before the camera i had before the was a nikon coolpix a compact one i thought this would have been a good camera for someone who enjoys good pictures without being a pro i realized that it was even better than what i expected maybe because i was coming from a nikon coolpix the colors are amazing and the quality of the picture is extremely good the is among the cheapest digital slr s and at the same time it is a very serious product i don t think the is much inferior to the canon rebel even if the canon has more megapixels of resolution i used both the which i own and the rebel at my school and i think the feels much more like a pro camera when you hold it in your hands while the rebel feels more like a toy the lenses provided in the package are good but are basic according to me the is better than the but i think i should have bought the as well to covers most of the pictures that you can take also the that nikon sells with the looks good to me but they don t make a kit with those lenses for the the last thing that really amazes me is the nef format nikon s raw format it is impressive how quickly you can improve a nef picture with your computer in just very few clicks of mouse if you want a good camera and you don t want to spend too much money for it i think this is the best choice
1,not really being into the original gta iii and its birds eye view predecessors i became unfortunately addicted to to san andreas the game play is absorbing and the storyline and cinematics are despite the dated graphics engaging maybe the most impressive aspect of the entire game is the impressive cinematic scene voice acting which makes you forget about some of the jerky animations the game play is free ranging but if you don t pursue the main storyline missions which are linear but multiple storylines let you pursue them in any priority the gratuitous violence you can commit is ultimately unrewarding and difficult to get away with as it should be the moral criticisms of the game include being able to randomly assault innocent bystanders without repurcussions but for the most part there are repurcussions if nearby police see you doing so my criticism would be that there are not enough repurcussions for street violence because it would certainly make that aspect of the game more challenging if you go on a rampage in a local store the clerks don t try to call the police or evade they instead just take a beating or a bullet the ai of some of the rival gangs is a little clumsy too as they will simply start shooting at you if they see your colors despite the presence of squad cars or bike cops across the street the cops in san andreas are corrupt but not that corrupt gta sa definitely feels like a ported title rather than a game developed for pc some of the interface and in game menus are awkward and designed to be gamepad friendly saving the game is a bit of a pain as well since you have to retreat to your safe house to save everytime a fun and engrossing game for adults but let this be known if you let your under child play this game you are an awful parent and deserve to have social services come and whisk your precious babies away aside from the violence san andreas is rife with profanity and innuendo and is probably not really suitable for anyone under there is no safe mode or low gore level for this game like some other titles while the game is overly violent gore is minimal anyway

1,when you look at the price it may seem pricey but when you get the product there is some serious engineering involved the web reviews have all been favorable and this is the reason i bought an ergotron the attention to detail is incredible mounting the middle monitor is definitely a two person job other than that the installation was flawless this is a very solid and well machined kudos to ergotron also these guys are serious about ergonomics pages on how to set proper height for various installations wonderful product stars shipping from amazon was slow and behind schedule

0,i had this alarm professionally installed by pepboys which is designtech s recommended professional installer after the initial installation with all the wiring was done pepboys found out that the brain was defective they confirmed this as well with several tests that they did after being on the phone with designtech s horrible customer service and several faxes later they sent me a new brain and i just mailed out the defective old brain with a prepaid mailing label that they provided after my visit with pepboys it was the same problem and yes designtech sent me a defective replacement several more calls and faxes later i got the one and that one turned out ok the features worked fine and the batteries lasted me a long time but the fob themselves are made up of really cheap looking plastic even the silver one other than that it worked fine i got a new truck and this time i ve invested in an audiovox system sold under the pursuit brand and i love that everything is so integrated and easier to upgrade i still had a professional install it and i ve never had any problems with it
0,i bought this to upgrade my previous version of mcafee total protection the first install was on a laptop when it configured the wireless security it actually made changes to my wap setup without notifying me first of all it said that i didn t have any security set up on the wireless connection although i have it set up with disabled ssid mac filtering wpa protection and after it was done it had changed the setup to wep also causing my other wireless pcs that don t have mcafee and my xbox to no longer connect to the network so i ended up deinstalling that part second pc regular desktop after installing the software only select pieces antivirus firewall spamkiller privacy service my multimedia sharing to the xbox no longer worked contacting mcafee support never yielded any usable response reinstall seems to be the default answer deinstalling reinstalling didn t help opening up the firewall didn t help etc etc so i ended up reverting back to my old version of mcafee i consider myself a power pc user i ve set up and configured dozens of pcs over the years built my own pc and i can honestly say that i have never used software worse than this one i hardly ever write reviews but i had to write this one be warned maybe mcafee will eventually get its act together but for me it s time to move on one last comment this mcafee software just like prior versions btw takes up a lot of resources several services need to run that take up a considerable amount of memory not good if you don t have ample memory

1,i have purchased both the home gardens interior and the punch interior software home gardens is much easier to use you can really start without reading much of the manual punch demands that you read the manual pages it is not intuative but punch can do so much more and has so much more creativity ie punch has a library of trees shrubs and flowers for your yard home gardens only have potted plants nothing you can use to landscape punch also allows you to make custom doors or windows to your exact specifications h g doesn t you have to choose a set style of door or window and change options i also could place digital photos of my backyard behind my house on punch to make it more realisitic i like both software programs but punch has more options but you have to do your homework first
0,man oh man i love documentaries and character studies crumb capturing the friedmans the thin blue line etc but this my god the mind boggles at the level of pretentiousness of the folks who claim to love or get this horrible mess over an hour and a half of two crazy women who are essentially shut ins rambling on about nothing at all in what looks like an abandoned shack surrounded by vermin and garbage a foot deep the two women in question are big edie and little edie the aunt and cousin of jackie o respectively let me sum up the whole minutes for you little edie i hate it here i had to leave new york to come here and take care of my mother big edie i was fine i used to have a lovely singing voice little edie but i missed out on my big chance to make it big edie oh well you missed out little edie i miss new york i hate it here big edie did you feed the cats little edie yes i fed them big edie i used to have a lovely singing voice now imagine this being repeated over and over again for minutes do yourself a favor before you let anyone talk you into seeing this piece of dreck just go sit on skid row for hours and listen to the rambling of the hobos and mental patients you ll save the money and get some fresh air at the same time horrible just plain horrible

1,i ordered this book primarily for the benefit of my year old son we re doing a research project on oceans and while we have a few good resources i felt this one with its imagery would more likely capture and hold his attention what i didn t realize was how thoroughly it would capture and hold mine for me had always meant multicolored plastic glasses and headaches though the book was described as stereoscopic i didn t understand what that meant stereography was something new for me even if as a form of photography it is over years old this is not a matter of red and blue separations the results from the human eye s trick of blending photos taken simultaneously an eye s width apart photographer mark blum is a pioneer in the art of underwater photography and his work is beautifully displayed here everyone i ve shown this book to has been fascinated by it and i fully expect that when we ve finished with our project the book will find its way to permanent display in my home
1,i have used this unit twice and have been more impressed each time first time was a loaner from my favorite golf shop and the second was the unit that i just purchased my reaction wow great tool for golfers at all skill levels the information presented appears to be extremely accurate and is much more accurate than guessing or finding a marker and then interpolating distances i found the intelligreen feature extremely useful i was able to shoot at several greens unseen whereas before i would have laid up in a safe visible landing zone short of the green the target lists were consistent with the features i was concerned about on most holes if anything i found the target list to contain too many items i found registration and set up a bit tedious and would like to sky golf make it easier be sure to read the installation instructions in the manual very closely your internet browser must be set to allow cookies from sky golf otherwise you may spend all day and never get set up or be able to download courses the variety of plans for course downloads is adequate but i wish they would include at least a year subscription to the basic par sky player course download plan with the purchase of the unit others have complained about quality and construction i don t know what their standards are but my unit seems well constructed and of very high quality material bottom line if you can afford it and you re looking for a great product to improve you knowledge of the golf courses you play then this product is for you
0,where are all of my magazine subscription first issues mar
0,it s true that you get what you pay for the good thing i can say about this product is that the price is right but the quality was low and the fit was poor however if you are strapped for money then they are certainly wearable but get a half size smaller than you usually would get

0,we have switched bottles with my daughter more times than i would like to admit she s had gas and discomfort with all of them i decided to try avent bottles i bought twelve of them and at first they seemed to relieve some of the gas but they leak horribly sometimes it s a few drops but most times it s like a continuous stream of formula a couple of times i wasn t paying close enough attention to the bottle while feeding and formula ended up soaking my daughter s bib her sleep sack her onesie and my shirt the entire bottle emptied all over us before i knew it the leak was that fast i tried every suggestion given to me mixing the formula in a seperate container mixing it in the bottles and using sealing disks to mix in the bottle heating before adding to the bottles heating in the bottles wetting the nipples not wetting the nipples making sure the bottle rim was properly inserted into the nipple ring etc i wrote a letter to avent and called twice about this issue each time the customer service rep spoke down to me and said i must not have read and followed the directions which i had don t waste your money on these expensive poorly designed bottles these are the worst on the market in my experience

0,pros uses less batteries than the space shuttle aas great idea gone to h quickly due to lack of product support apparently the person in charge of designing and marketing tapes for these units suffers from attention deficit disorder and is totally unable to remotely consider any meaningful complete line of tapes red blue white pearl paper yellow smiley faces green metalic black on clear but no white on clear there appears to be little if any hope for those who might actually like to color code products in any single medium plastic paper polyester metallic etc just whatever come to the designer s head is what s released five types here two there one over here no rhyme nor reason dymo has done themselves no favors here
1,this thermometer and hydrometer is not only attractive but works beautifully i was given one as a gift and later bought one to give as a gift
1,the novels in this series are not the escapist fantasies that many associate with the arthurian legends they are in fact historical fiction at its best whyte has gone to great lengths to not only ensure historical accuracy but to weave the stories into historic events the first six novels in the series that is all i have read though it appears that there are two or three more give a wonderfully plausible explaination for the genesis of the arthurian legend but the beauty of the books is in whyte s prose a scottish poet he uses the language beautifully and creates characters so vivid and multidimensional that we forget the between their time and ours these books will not insult your intelligence and they prove that one does not need to suspend the laws of physics or distort the facts of history to find magic in the arthurian legend

0,i was trying to watch it but can not open de dvd because it is the wrong country code
1,i took a class on sociology and law in college and my professor kept on referring to this book i decided to see what he was talking about first hand and am glad i did this book is expertly written and thought provoking this is kind of book that you take out and reference every once in a while yes it does get boring in some parts but i think that if you are in the legal profession or you just like history this is a book for you
1,i found that for the price this set was great it comes with one rascus figure and one shadow knight the catapult is very orginal and powered by a rubber band i got it to go and a half feet there were also some improvements in the pieces for example the flagpole was less annoying the weapons were improved and the head pieces came on and off much smoother whether you are starting lego castle or are an expert builder this is great set
1,i bought this to record interviews done primarily on the phone and it s worked beautifully clear and easy to use once downloaded onto my computer i used the olympus transcription package to transcribe the interviews this allowed me to listen on headphones control the progression and backtracking of the interview with a foot pedal and keep both hands on the keyboard to type quickly this voice recorder plus the transcription package dramatically cut the amount of time i had to take trascribing the interviews well worth the price i d recommend this combo highly especially to other journalists
1,the product if reviewed just on taste would only warrant a two but the convenience is worth a five it is probably the best la briute product that i have found it is a two minute meal that is not completely objectionable but it is way too salty

0,i bought this dvd recorder because it was one of the few that recorded onto virtually every format plus it s a sony and i ve never had any problems with sony before the recorder works intermittently it recorded a few hours worth of shows then it would corrupt the disk rendering it useles abaout of the time i thought maybe it was the media so i bought sony media this time it only corrupted the disk of the time i sent the product to sony for repair and they could not duplicate the issue so they sent it back the sony repair service center is located in south texas where the labor is cheap and it shows i got my unit back and on the disk it failed now the door is jammed and i can t take the dvd out don t buy this product i m buying samsung from now on
0,this magazine is published by the same people that brought us maxim so if you like maxim check it out if you don t pass the pictures are slick models are attractive but there is little in the way of information on how to do it yourself or what was actually done to the bike it is basically a picture book if you are looking for technical articles how tos or performance installs check out road bike for metrics or hot bike or american iron for harleys and victory s
0,i was very unhappy with this product because the paint is chipping off the wood side boards which is very dangerous for kids i was wondering if there was it possible for me to get new side boards for my grandson s wagon which i purchased for his birthday he is unable to play with the wagon because of the paint chipping off
1,i am a huge fan of tasty bite products and was delighted to find that amazon now stocks them since they are expensive in my small town no trader joe s here i was excited to see this variety that i had never tried before and readily ordered the six pack of these noodles with peanut sauce expecting the same ready to eat food that the other tasty bites i have tried offer but unlike their ready to eat rice dishes in which the rice and the packet merely need heating but are already fully cooked the noodles here are in their raw state and need to be boiled for ten minutes so you can t grab this and bring it to work the way you can most other tasty bite meals also the peanut sauce has a delectable and complex flavor but is spiced and textured so that i felt it really needed some vegetables and or meat to round it out i love spicy dishes but this meal seemed planned to be overly spiced so that when you add the veggies and meat it would be perfect so as a quick meal starter at home or as a way of helping to use up leftover meat and veggies this gets five stars it was delicious some additions i have enjoyed are chicken steak bell pepper cauliflower carrots eggplant and sweet potato but i am giving this meal four stars overall because my expectation from eating other tasty bite entrees was that this was a grab and go meal that i could pop in the microwave and have prepared in a couple of minutes
0,i bought this shopping cart for my grandaughters age and months old they love pushing it around without the baby seat without the basket in other words they are quite adept at taking it apart rolling around the frame the doll is difficult to put in the cardboard groceries were put away until they are older the other groceries are fine the pouring milk container is great as are the pretend veggies mac n cheese they both put them in the containers i am disappointed and was looking for a shopping cart that my own daughters had that actually looks like a cart doesn t disassemble so easily

1,my wife and i have adjoining offices and we keep a variety of soups and snacks on hand so we can eat in together when we don t both have time to eat out this soup is one of our favorites we like the flavor and the texture creamy with nice chunks of potato lots of corn kernels pieces of carrot and bell pepper i keep a bottle of hot pepper on hand to spice it up but my wife prefers it as it is we microwave it in the envelope and then pour it into two mugs there s just the right amount in one evelope for the two of us when i have a sandwich to go with it without the sandwich i find one envelope about right for me this isn t the healthiest of the pacific foods soups that we ve tried in terms of fat protein carbohydrate content the beef stew is better in that regard but we don t like the beef stew without considerable extra seasoning and it s very thin for a stew and we like the creaminess of this chowder we eat a balanced diet so that really isn t an issue this is very satisfying and it s the one office food item we order again and again
1,this is a must have for your little sweetheart my daughter carries this purse around with her everywhere that she goes it s quit interesting finding what she has placed in her purse next the accessories are cute but she d rather use stuff from mommy s purse the purse is oh so cute too and durable my daughter is months old she received this on christmas and has been a favorite since
0,i bought this for my grand daughter and here is my daughter s reviews of how this product is working or not hmmmmm she loves the music more than the potty itself we listen and dance to the potty song everyday but there has been little progress with the actual potty i think the way to go for her may be the attachable seat that goes on top of the real toliet otherwise she carries the potty around from room to room and treats it like a seat i think getting something that looks more like a real toliet would have worked better or perhaps she was going thru a phase that is not over yet so maybe she will get into it again after a few weeks thanks anyway i don t find this very encouraging so i wish i had purchased something else
1,you learn extremely fast using rosetta stone and you learn to think about what the word is not it s translation probably the best language system available
0,the oatmeal tastes okay but the purchaser should be aware that this is not an instant version of mccann s irish steel cut oatmeal the oatmeal it is famous for i thought mccann s only sold steel cut oatmeal but it also apparently sells the regular type of instant oatmeal that is flavored i would not buy this again since the steel cut oatmeal is what i prefer and is much better for you
1,i chose office ultimate as it seemed to not only have everything i could possibly need to run a business but also easy functionality that would keep me from pulling my hair out because of software or design issues ultimate certainly doesn t disappoint set up was fairly easy two disks came with the package disk one contains most of the software and disk two contains applications that guarantee that you are the owner of the software and have the right to all of the accounting and key business functions ribbon technology removes the old hunt and find menu method although for those of us that took the time to memorize and learn the location of every buttom and drop down it did take a day or two to get used to the new set up integration with the web and other programs is virtually seemless excel is no longer the chore it once was because of the above mentioned ribbon accounting software is included ink and crossword i m not one for games on my business pc but for anyone that likes to doodle or zone out with crosswords ultimate lives up to its name by including an art program designed for pen users and excellent crosswords onenote i like post its perhaps a little too much l and always used the post it note software on my business computer to keep notes i used onenote sparingly because i simply found the post it note software easier to use on my desktop but with my tablet pc one note added a new dimension to my notetaking that i feel will work well with my business the earlier mentioned web and application integration and handwriting to text functionality i may still use post it now and then for quick notes or perhaps the windows stickys but the long note pages pasting of images and other web info and pen to paper note taking makes this product invaluable word what can i say this is my primary software tool and i use it on a tablet pc the applications were made for my computer type i can easily click on formatting tools with the touch of my wacom pen and i don t have to stop mid thought to make a change or wait until i finish the document to then make my edits powerpoint publisher access groove infopath et cetera also included i am still delving into these but they appear to have all of the perks of the other programs so did i have any dislikes the ink program doesn t respond to my wacom pen as well as the windows journal or microsoft onenote it also doesn t have easy to use tools within the software since it was an extra and will not be my primary desktop publishing design or art tool i ll probably remove it at some point from my tablet microsoft does not include an instruction manual or reference book with this program as a result after installation of the first disk and microsoft s statement that all of my programs were installed i couldn t find my accounting software had no idea that the accounting software was on the second disk the second disk when loaded doesn t mention that the software is on the disk until after the software installation is complete and instead mentions other business applications and wasted over an hour trying to find it also i m a hands on person and although i have access to the internet whenever i need it i enjoy having an actual book in my hands from time to time while learning ultimate is made with enough simplicity that a manual isn t really necessary i e most questions can be answered by the help window but for the hefty price tag i don t think it would have been too much to ask microsoft to include a basic this is how you install the programs and this is what to expect booklet also note athough microsoft through their downloads e mail updates provided a getting started tab with a how to for each major software applications the tabs had to be added after the fact and many of you might find yourselves frustrated with the lack of upfront instructions on how to use the software beside those few quirks i fully stand behind my star rating of this product and purchasing this product through amazon i e amazon s pricing was less than the big boy retailers or online vendors shipping turnaround with super saver days
0,this product will not work on my notebook even after multiple installs the tech support emailed that any cd or dvd copy software had to be removed i guess that sort of makes a dvd or cd r w drive rather pointless i removed the copy software and still have bad results about out of twenty times it get to the menu were you can actually use it maybe it doesn t like my corporate virus protection i find it hard to believe that a lot of government agencies and large companies use this software if it that picky i rate this product as totally useless

1,this watch is great it recharges itself self adjusts with the atomic clock world time auto lighting etc just to mention a few features as this is from the g shock series it is really sturdy and scratch water weather heat shock resistant it has both the digital and the analog hand to view the time whichever is convenient this synchronizes with the atomic clock time and the daylight savings which means you need not adjust the time another interesting feature is that if you tilt your hand in the dark towards you then the watch lights up showing you the time there are a few cons there is no seconds hand on it but there is a digital second indicator this watch is slightly heavy and huge but after a few months you get adjusted to it you need to go through the manual as there are so many features and you have only four buttons
0,i watched this movie and it sucked very slow it might be a renter not a owner
0,when i first purchased the papermate phd multi i thought wow what an awesome instrument felt great in the hand and i iove the flow of the ink very smooth nice pencil and stylus as bonus however because i liked the pen so much and used it every chance i got within weeks the ink cartridge was empty that s when my love of the pen began to falter i opened the pen according to the package instructions and removed the ink cartridge however it never worked the same again the twist and click feature failed to hold the pen in the advanced position so whenever i would bear down to write it would retract and push up into the pen again so i bought another thinking i must have done something wrong carefully after the ink ran out in weeks this time guess i did more writing i changed the cartridge again same thing at a high price tag for a plastic pen i bought a third and gave it one more try same luck so while i loved the feel and flow of the pen it is certainly not worth the price tag for a pen whose mechanisms housing and construction will only last a month won t buy another one three times and you re out
1,this camera is very similar to the fuji but has face detection fd that autofocuses on faces in a photo great for taking pictures of yourself or for snapshots you don t have time to compose excellent quality photos in dim light at iso photos are washed out and noisy but still good for capturing an image you would otherwise miss option to limit iso to or to camera will use any speed up to the limit iso is extremely good as good as my canon digital rebel xti usual modes i never use flower landscape etc but one unique mode i use all the time no flash flash the camera takes a picture without flash up to iso and then takes a picture with flash immediately after usually takes less than one second to capture both images no flash doesn t surprise anyone and ruin the candid shot while the following flash guarantees you ll get the image even if the warm glow of candlelight is ruined i always have the camera set to this mode uses xd cards which i hate but if you buy a gb card you ll be able to take photos without ever needing to change the card also battery life is unbelieveable fully charge the camera over several hours and you ll be able to take photos half with flash before the battery is drained fuji brand underwater housing is optional watertight to ft camera comes with underwater setting to intensify non blue colours and still keep the intense blue of the water literally every diver should have one of these cameras i recommend this camera without hesitation there simply isn t anything else like it on the market

1,i ve been using the stainless steel weber grates for a few weeks now having replaced the old porcelain ones i think the heating is quicker more event and perhaps even more absorbing for the items on the grill not sure if that makes sense but it seems that the foods seem to heat through adequately in a shorter amount of time without getting overcooked i do tend to keep the burners down low and turn the cover down on almost everything i cook i m a little disappointed that the grates don t stay shiny stainless steel even in the areas on which i don t lay down foods i guess that s because of all the heat swirling around when i have the cover closed all in all i give this a hearty recommendation
0,many of the columns were interesting painting a picture of a vast right ring conspiracy that hillary clinton first brought to the public discourse but it seems that most of these pieces are obsolete without any interest either as themselves or as a theme does anyone care about texas state politics in or phil gramm s problems as a senator or as a presidential candidate someone should have gone through this and culled out what was obsolete except that that would probably have left less material than would make up a book just going through a bunch of previously written columns and passing them off as a book may be a cheap and easy way to publish something but it is an inadequate read
1,i love this watch it was my christmas present to myself the ribbons are easy to interchange and i wear them with the silver bracelet as well it comes in a cute and durable box that i now use to store all of my watches a perfect gift and good quality i especially like the little heart on the minute sweep

1,the coltrane soundscapes that this cd is infused flies to the mountain and back again that s the truth but one troubling question for me remains no matter how much i enjoy this fusion incarnation by masters new old where in the world is alan holdsworth if any fusion guitar player has the rightful title claim to the coltrane moniker it s holdsworth for years he s been building the bridge between the good old philosophies and the new world order including holdsworth would have just been the jazziest thing to do

0,the self cleaning concept was the reason i bought this razor the razor cleans and lubricates automatically and the price for consumables was not bad after owning the razor for two months i noticed that the red indicator light on the cleaning base was on after i had just refilled the fluid after a closer inspection i found out that the fluid had leaked out all over and this fluid destroys everything it touches that isn t metal or plastic i thought maybe i had done something to cause the problem so i refilled the cleaning base and started the cleaning process immediately the fluid in the base started spewing out of the cracks where the top of the base and the bottom of the base come together it is now headed to the landfill the trimmer does not work well either

1,okay for all those who are fans of the orwell classic you have to understand how difficult this tale is to bring to the big or small screen we re dealing with talking animals relating to humans this tale is too deep for the movie public and any movie will fall short for true purists taking it for what it is it is an accurate depiction of the novel the reviewer who didn t see moses the raven in the story must have watched a different film it is really difficult to get people today to feel the horror of what animal farm represented when originally written take that and put it under the hallmark label and it can be just plain confusing for those who haven t read the novel i truly enjoyed this film i reccomend it for all even if it is a little difficult to follow unlike the box says it is not for children
0,great use for five minutes then one broke having use kendo shinai bamboo swords before i would not suggest these and only bought them as i had a dollar gift certificate to get rid of
0,this film was probably made not to entertain the audience but more to show as much as possible the reality of the terrible agresion on bosnia but it does so for a small part only showing the bosniaks and serbs living together peacefuly before the agresion with the begin of hostilities this film leaves its half folkloral nature and becomes a pure propaganda movie of serbian nationalists its attempt to blind the viewer hoping he never watchs news or read a newspaper is amaturelike and fails not only through its fake of reality but also through poor cinematografic form the dialogs are poor and the actors definitely not worth the theme of the movie handfull of interesting phrases and few fleshes of situation are by far not enough to save the movie from the abyss the handling shows several onlogical moments and as a concept of we all suffered and we serbs did not start the war it only makes a serious and average informed viewer laughing this movie does not entertain at all and shows the events as unrealistic as any b movie about vietnamwar and about facts it shows only that there are very unserious and nationalistic directors and producers in serbia my rating is absolutely thumb down comparing with for example no man s land this motion picture is failing in everything that makes movies about war a potential time window about occurences in former yugoslavia instead to jump into the minds of people that participated the war you can only get an idea of dogma that the director is trying to spread by making this underaverage movie
1,this is a great product a friend told me about it i finally decided to get one i had bleeding gums in two weeks of regular use bleeding has stopped and i can see that my teeth is getting whiter and and my gums are great just be careful when using the water jet side you must turn it on with the flossing part in your mouth or it will spray all over the place
1,this camera case is great it s very small and fits my coolpix perfectly there is enough room to fit an extra memory card and some batteries but the batteries make it tight i originally purchased the camera case listed for the but it was a little bulky and the zipper could scratch the camera if you aren t careful this camera case does not come with a strap like the other but that is something i would never use i highly recommend this case for those who want a small sleek case to protect their camera
0,the jellifish is no replacement for a twelve string guitar you can not play it fast it is fragile and the tone is scratchy that being said it can be used to make some interesting sounds for color in rhythm and slow lead playing it is not something i would use often my mm clayton feels and sounds great after after a few minutes of playing the jellifish after one hour of use the jellifish is starting to show signs of wear and tear so don t say you weren t warned
1,herb alpert has done what few artists can do he s taken his seminal masterwork and transformed it into another entity that is equal to or may even surpass the original i love the original whipped cream but this cd is a masterstroke combining alpert s traditionally peppy music with downbeat electronica transforms it into a soothing but never boring mix that continues to enchant the listener from beginning to end unlike some of the purists i loved this cd and you will too
0,the weekly standard is just more of the same it s not strictly speaking journalism but i imagine you d like it if you enjoy reading articles that set out to promote a very conservative point of view if you like rush or fox news you d probably like it if you are looking for a serious media outlet this is not it
1,most people that like wes anderson s films are rabid fanatics and i m no exception so when the chance came to buy his first feature length film for i snapped it up if you enjoyed life aquatic or the royal tenenbaums you ll enjoy this on some levels too many of anderson s classy touches are already in evidence in this film the story is fun and the characters are well developed yeah pretty much buy it if you like the wilson brothers or wes anderson the high point of the movie is certainly luke wilson s character masterfully done even in his first role

0,just received one for my son s birthday he loves it as he has a laptop like daddy the quality is terrible like another user s experience the right side of the device doesn t work properly and this is brand new apparently the sensors on the device don t line up properly with the go circles or volume icons on pages with them on the right side i can t exchange it as i am not in the us so we can only play with half a book unless we experiment with finding where the right side sensors actually are this of course is very frustrating to a yr old as it really messes up alot of stuff also the type of pencil seems rally sharp and brittle for a yr old ps the box says for yr olds vs amazons text of less than by the manufacturer

0,i picked this up because a it s boz scaggs a guy whose records i wore out when they first hit and b it s full of great old songs but boz sounds like he s doing something else maybe surfing the internet or looking out the window when he sings hard to imagine that the man who punched out lido can sound so half asleep performing great material a washed out almost depressing performance there are many much better renditions of these classic songs i imagine it s hard to come up with new material but please if you re going to do these songs at least sing as if you re awake no emotion no involvement and to add annoyance to injury boz somehow found the world s worst drummer for this session if you can tap your fork on a tabletop you can play the cymbals and traps as well as him incessantly dopey and grindingly repetitive pass on this one

0,if you can learn to dance by reading a book whose recommendation was to hold your partner and move to the music then you may find kaizen event implementation manual useful this book talks about the history and terminology of lean manufacturing and does go into detail about team member selection after that this book shows blank forms of some of the data analysis forms often used during a kaizen event but tells you nothing of how to complete the forms and analyze the results nor is there any road map or guidelines for conducting a kaizen event itself there is information about how to contact the author in the event that you decide to hire him to fill in all blanks in person the book is simply another info mercial where in this case you are paying for the advertisement

1,published in dr deming out of the crisis seems to form the basis for the transformation needed in american management mentality two main subjects are discussed in the book the first is the exposure of problems and pitfalls in top management operations the second relates suggestions and solutions that can solve and transform the way american management operates core points are suggested by dr deming to address problems in management and are supported by many examples using different scientific methods throughout the book dr deming promotes the loss of slogans that are even today being practiced by a share of the american industry and advocates management that is based on principles such as quality and leadership at times the book is not a continuous process that is easy to follow but overall dr deming s concepts are transferred to the reader dr deming s out of the crisis helped me learn new perspectives about how management and employees can help in building or transforming an industry to a successful one

1,what it is this charmin ultra bathroom tissue is very soft absorbent long lasting and a terrific value the shortcomings of the scott s standard mainstay roughness are not a concern here charmin ultra is nearly perfect in every way the new gold standard for the bathroom arguably has become charmin ultra especially if your needs require a softer tissue than the scott s scott s standard bathroom tissue is stronger than charmin ultra but charmin ultra s strength is ample for the intended use of the product the ply construction makes the sheet rolls go much farther than one might expect and does add body and mass to the product add to this the extra absorbency of charmin ultra over scott s and i would say that charmin ultra has a clear edge the bottom line basically these two products compare much like bounty versus viva paper towels while both products score high marks in every area there are significant differences bounty is stonger and viva is softer making both choices excellent but dependent on the needs of the individual consumer results of our in house trial between this charmin scott extra soft we compared charmin ultra to scott super soft in what turned out to be a no contest event the charmin ultra is much softer than the scott extra soft though the scott extra soft is an improvement over their standard product but still quite rough i am not affiliated with any product or company
0,ernest hemingway dies on page of this page book and so does author valerie hemingway s story for that reason this book merits only two stars early in her story of meeting hemingway in spain in at age valerie is aware of the author s magnetic and dominant personality around him everything came to life there was an urgency and vitality that did not ebb when she stays focused on the story of ernest hemingway this is an endearing look at the older struggling hemingway finding temporary renewal in the freshness of an innocent irish girl who entered his life during the final drafts of a moveable feast but the youthful time spent with the famous writer works against this memoir since she was clearly neither as dedicated a correspondent or note taker as her subject as a result her recollections are thin and easily available in other sources such as a e hotchner s papa hemingway the two years she spent living and traveling with hemingway through spain paris key west cuba and america share as much space as her weird marriage with hemingway s strange son gregory apparently the other bull referred to in the title it shows the continuing vitality of ernest hemingway even in death and over years later that a valerie hemingway can find a book deal for her meager remembrances of such a great man
1,hp was the first paper i tried when i started making t shirts it cracked so i got commercial iron on paper that cracked too my supplier told me the iron had to be hot enough and i had to press hard putting my weight behind it that s alot of weight haha so i bought a new iron set it at the hottest setting and i pressed each part of the transfer for the same length of time and i pressed hard but i started burning the transfers because the new iron was too hot so i set it a hair under the highest cotton setting instead of all the way up to linen and it was just right for a whole sheet transfer i first iron around the transfer to set it down then i press in increments of about three inches for five long seconds all the way across making about four or five rows of presses to get from the top to the bottom and then start all over again going up and down making four or five rows of presses to get from one side to the other i press and lift rather than pushing when i m done pressing i move the iron in a kind of circular pattern all around the transfer again pressing firmly then i lift up one edge and peel it back a ways to check the tranfser if it looks good i warm it up again where i m going to peel and then start peeling and let the iron follow me so the transfer doesn t cool down as i m peeling so i don t get shiny edges phew what a pain in the anyways just when i really got the hang of it my supplier let me down and i couldn t get my professional paper in time for the weekend so i went back to the hp using the same technique it burned the first time and so i set the iron about a half a number under what i had it set at before and didn t iron it quite as long it looked really good but i wanted to see if the transfer was strong enough so instead of waiting i threw it right in the washer inside out cold water no bleach knits delicates setting on the dryer i was surprised how soft it was i couldn t even tell it was a transfer and the color was good so it wasn t the hp that was the problem initially it was me if you re gonna use this stuff or any iron on transfer the best thing i can tell you is to experiment on an old shirt try the hottest setting first and turn it down if it burns you ll know you ve burned when you see something like a tea stain on your shirt it feels a bit fuzzy and you ll see part of your graphic is left behind on the transfer paper when you peel it off i think that s because instead of the ink going into the shirt it burns back into the paper be sure to count the seconds and make sure every inch of the transfer gets an even hard press i found the cracking is mainly due to the iron not being hot enough and not pressing down hard enough the polymers gotta be sqooshed into the fabric also i iron onto a nice smooth piece of wood and i don t use a pillow case or anything between the shirt and the wood and i stretch the shirt very slightly and tuck it in so it doesn t move when i iron then i let the shirt cool down slowly before i take it off the wood thinking if it cools down too fast that might make it crack more before i got the new iron i was ironing with a piece of sheet metal on top of the wood to conduct heat that was better but the new iron getting the temperature right and ironing hard and evenly did the trick for me

0,i had a different experience than the other reviewer i would also consider myself a beginner golfer but the medicus has not worked for me it might work if you have never picked up a golf club and you are learning for the first time but if you are trying to improve your swing it doesn t help you develop a way to swing the club without breaking the hinge but it is still a bad swing i heard from a golf pro that it is good if you already have a solid swing and you are trying to improve it but not good for beginners
1,these are hands down the most awesome pillows we have ever owned they were originally suggested by a chiropractor at per pillow however at the time a water bed pillow for just sounded silly what brought me back around to these pillows was the year long search that my wife and i had been on for the perfect pillows one of her beloved cats managed to destroy our previous and quite comfortable pillows which subsequently caused us to get caught up in the frustrating search for the perfect pillow we spent a year buying this pillow and that pillow all to no avail then one day i rolled the dice and bought a pair of these pillows with the covers the covers actually make the dish these are the most comfortable pillows that i have ever slept on in my years on this planet these pillows rate stars just follow the directions and enjoy the best nights sleep you have ever had i do not work for nor own this company although after using their product i wish i did our pillows are about three months old so far and holding up exceptionally well they recommend you change the water every six months or so depending on what type of water you put in the pillow is about half to three quarters cushion with the water being the bottom layer they seal tight and do not leak there is no audible sound from the water in the pillow as if you follow the directions they will instruct you on how to expel excess air these pillows and of those black decker scissors have to be my two best finds for

1,it s easy to realize once again what makes garth ennis one of the best writers in the field when reading this one throughout the story i was unable to predict what was going to happen on the next page and despite ennis making this into a rollercoaster ride he still keeps it all believable mind you this story is not on par with the preacher series not much is but it still is a story that rises far above the average comic book story the characters are all interesting often funny and they ll hold your attention with ease not once was the story faltering and in the case of you being a smoker maybe at the end you ll be cured of that habit as another reviewer pointed out this is one hell of an anti smokers add so if you feel like picking up a well told story with constantine in the lead you ll do best to pick up this one if however you are not yet acquainted with ennis s preacher than you better turn to that one
0,spongebob is making an obscene gesture personally i don t think it is an appropriate toy for children anyone that thinks spongebob is merely pointing a finger shouldn t be so naive as to how toys are marketed and the moral decline of our society
1,i used four of these for a digital camera kodak and the camera took approximately pictures compared to what was previously in it is a lot i also used a couple of these batteries in a portable radio cd player the usage time was phenominal considering there were several times when i had the radio in my backpack and it would get turned on from hitting something in the bag and would remain on for long periods of time it still works to this day on the same two batteries

0,i ve always been a fan of roger moore s james bond but what i ve discovered in recent years is that only a couple of his bond movies were like actually good the spy who loved me is not one of them oh sure it s fun almost all of the bond flicks are fun but it s basically just a kid s movie and that s not necessarily a good thing stromberg is a lame villain yes his underwater lair is well designed but it s silly not as silly as that ice palace in die another day but pretty silly barbara bach is one of the very worst bond girls she s not an ugly woman to be sure but she was a terrible actress she sounds like she s reading poorly from a cue card in ever single scene she s in jaws is a stupid character having metal teeth wouldn t actually make you capable of biting through metal the metal you were biting would resist and you d end up just tearing up your gums i don t expect realism from movies but i also expect them to not be outright idiotic that said jaws is effectively used and richard kiel was excellent in the role the disco score is terrible terrible the plot is nothing more than a rehash of you only live twice but on the ocean rather than in space certain elements of the big final shootout are even the same in both movies embarrassing i love bond but this is not one of the highlights the dvd is good with a couple of fine documentaries but the commentary track grates because the director and other commentators spend way too much time patting themselves on the back for the great job they supposedly did even if that were true it d be annoying
1,if you are trying to decide between a wood or foam yoga block i can highly recommend the foam blocks with beveled edges because they are very comfortable when you are pressing on the blocks they are firm enough to withstand your body weight but not overly firm so they make your hands hurt from the pressure blocks tend to encourage proper form because they allow you to slowly work into poses and provide the needed support when you can t reach the floor in a pose the lightweight blocks are easy to move from side to side and they can work as an extension of your arm there are many ways you can use these blocks and once i started to do the yoga step by step workouts yoga practice sessions i found i really did need to buy softer yoga blocks to try some of the more advanced positions the rebecca review
0,i got this to replace my which after a year started giving me a memory card error message i now find out that was a design flaw anyway i spent hundreds of dollars on this one and now just over a year after i got it it won t hold a battery charge i loved both cameras while they worked but i can t afford a camera plus the related accessories every year or so i ve written to canon tech support unless they are willing to repair or replace this one free of charge i m moving on to another brand camera

1,i had the distinct pleasure of seeing richard jeni live a few years ago and i gotta tell you that i really almost peed my pants he was astoundingly funny this dvd definitely captures his comic genius although it is woefully short compared to the amazing talent that he is and that he expressed in the huge amount of material he developed it was incredibly sad to see that he took his own life which from what i heard was based at least in part on the fact that he was not able to get the gigs he used to get which is itself really sad he developed what i think is the best comedy which is comedy that stings and bites because it reveals us human beings as full of weaknesses that are ultimately pretty stupid in the face of everything good in this world he will be sorely missed in this world that needs more people to show us all the dumb things we do and by doing so how we should and can be a lot better than we are
0,robin gibb has one of the most distinctive voices of the with the bee gees or as a solo artist he has enough hits to make his own live show however in this live recording he chooses to recreate mostly bee gees hits on which he had a secondary role on their famous three part harmonies thus he needs the help of another lead singer chorus and the neue philharmonie frankfurt orchestra but everything goes wrong here robin s voice remains buried among a real bulk of unmixed music the lead singer no list of credits is a poor substitute to barry gibb s famous falsetto the female voices are not very inspired to say the least while the orchestra is frequently out of tune and noisy the winds on juliet are really unbearable post production seems to be non existent and the overall sound is chaotic lines notes by experts andrew mon hughes and ann grootjans are interesting and illustrative but they seem to belong to another album the message from robin gibb seems to be clear i can do it all by myself well he cannot he should re listen to one night only and check for sound harmonies and production
0,i was impressed with this controller at first and found it to feel comfortable and work well it was played with once and a while for about a month total hours max some time after that the next time i went to use it it would only go left in a game that used the left joystick i could not get it to center or even stay still it would just keep either steering the car like or whatever the left joystick would do for the game no matter what i tried it several times and it has never worked since i fire it up once and a while to see if it s still doing it and it does i am very dissapointed in this and i was pretty careful about getting this newer version of the logitech controller i think i paid about locally for it and i just bought a pelican extreme edge from radio shack on clearance for that works and feels as good but is less than half the cost i don t really feel like going thru a warranty claim if it s even covered but it still annoys me every time i look at it in my xbox drawer of extra stuff i was going to go totally wireless units and luckily didn t run out and buy more of these logitech controllers i instead bought some extra microsoft s controllers as they are still one of the best feeling controllers out there if the pelican holds up model pl version i might go get some more if i can find them locally
0,completely useless only shows a digital display when ipod is fully charged how long does your ipod stay fully charged even when showing digital display doesn t actually broadcast maxell replaced it with the p for a reason amazon shouldn t even be selling this it makes me distrust amazon i got it as a christmas present but it was bought in october so they won t even take it back follow up after i emailed amazon they issued a complete refund which they refused to do over the phone now they just need to pull the product since they probably wisely aren t carrying the p and therefore can t recommend it as an option

1,my kids and are learning so much from fritz and chesster in fact my year old daughter started winning a few games at their local chess club after graduating to this game from fritz and chesster today i decided to play with them since they don t like to play against each other they re still working on that good sportsmanship thing and i let them team up against me i was viewing this as an opportunity to help them think ahead predict moves and protect their pieces however i was the one who learned they surprised me again and again by reciting strategies move your bishops and knights out save your queen for the real battle don t move your pawns willy nilly break your oponnent s wall etc they had learned from this game they also knew the relative value of the pieces but could see advantages to making uneven swaps sometimes for example they shocked me by sacrificing a bishop for a pawn in order to open a hole in my wall which they later exploited to checkmate my king this was a strategy that even month ago would have been unthinkable to them anyway i defer to other more experienced chess players and computer users who have made specific comments about graphics dialogue and strategies i am sure that at some point my kids will move beyond this game and what it has to offer but for now i couldn t be happier with the chesster and fritz games my kids absolutely love playing the computer games and are really learning to play chess and not just computer chess but chess that lets them beat other kids at chess club not to mention me i think i m going to go demand a rematch
1,while it is obvious that the life expectancy for this item in the hands of a toddler may be short it is none the less an actual miniature real guitar that can be tuned and played if this item were made in america it s cost would be prohibitive and it s quality would probably be in question as well this being no reflection on the american worker but rather the american corporate machine which is only concerned with profit
1,i have to tell anyone who has lower back or foot pain to try a pair of merrells when you try them on they feel comfortable but once you wear them for a week you ll never wear another brand of footwear unless you have to most of their shoes need no break in time i own these in four different colors my eldest daughter owns two pairs of these i own more than pairs of merrells i have been wearing these for years the cool thing about them is when you see someone else wearing a pair it s like you re both in on a secret you know you re walking in heaven

1,this perfume is my absolute favorite it smells so good i love it and this roll on is so easy you can just pack it in your purse and use it whenever its so convenient but you won t have to really put it on several times day once is enough the scent carries on all day long i highly recommend this fragrance as a gift to anyone
0,i loved the idea of the clapper i live alone so the clapping sound wouldn t bother me and i looked forward to the convenience factor my first clapper lasted about months and then mysteriously stopped working but the dead unit did smell suspiciously funny like an electrical short did i learn my lesson oh no i went ahead and purchased another clapper some months later the night before last the lamp i connected this one to started blinking i checked the lightbulb and it was ok it was only went i got down close to the clapper plugged into the outlet that i heard the dreaded sizzling sound and saw a flash of electricity once again the clapper crapped out this time in a different lamp different outlet will i never learn thank goodness nothing happened due to the highjinks of this faulty device can you say housefire again how dumb am i is the unit ul approved and if so have any other complaints been lodged about it how does one find this out i like my gadgets but buyer beware on this one
0,i bought two boxes of these luv diapers thats diapers and i sure wish i had spent a little extra for pampers swaddlers these diapers leak out the top because they don t have any elastic on the tabs or anywhere on the waist even the generic kroger diapers have elastic waistbands i am just sad that i have to use these crappy diapers for so long i also think they run small so i probably will not even use them all what a waste the only good thing about these diapers is the price but i would highly recommend that you just buy your store brand instead if money is an issue p s i don t like huggies either because they leak out the legs hard to find a good diaper
1,i cannot go shopping without my floppy seat i don t know what i am going to do when my infant outgrows either the front pack or car seat as my toddler rides with the floppy i reccommend this to everyone who comments on it to purchase for themselves or as a gift i have seen another seat with a large pillow in front for kids to sleep on or as one mom with a little girl who has siezures could use as protection but i can t remember where babycenter com as other reviewers mentioned i also used mine for the restaurants too when my toddler was too small to fit comfortably in the seats not to mention the gunk in the chairs buy this product you won t be dissapointed
1,i bought this because i wanted a primer for make up but have acne prone skin and felt that most other primers would make me break out as some reviews have stated initially i did break out a little but i kept using it becuase the rest of my skin looked so great and felt so smooth after a week the breakouts went away they were minor and all i can say is wow my skin looks so much better my make up looks better i look better without make up etc etc i use it with complete me powder foundation and i have never in all my years been happier with a pair of products
1,this is an awsome peice of work the person who thought of this is a genious and i would like to thank him her because i have perchased this product and it has lasted a long time all the other ones that i have bought have broken in a weeks period of time
1,you can purchase this item at most any walmart or k mart etc for or cheaper toywiz is ripping people off
0,after seeing the photo and reading the other reviews i thought this would be a good buy i m not really thrilled about this jacket it s a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker it doesn t have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel this is something you can easily find at walmart on sale for
1,this is a very flexible and capable camera if you are looking for more than a point shoot will offer there are very few that would compare for me the deciding factor was the high quality lieca lens with wide angle if you havent compared this directly with a conventianal lens you will be amazed at what youve been missing the is an ok feature if you plan on hdtv veiwing but the screen size is compromised when you switch to i would prefer a larger screen and lose the feature the lens cap is a little annoying as well but those issues aside i am very satisfied
1,the scene where eric idle whines oh you re no fun anymore is a deceptive one if anything these guys are even more fun than before the second half of monty python s flying circus s first season is even more polished and mad than the first continuing the tradition of short skits focused on complete insanity in these episodes we have a serial killer barber lecherous art critics an unfortunate man who tries to eat a cathedral tunnel to java and jump the english channel ken shabby every girl s dad s nightmare thuggish old ladies bloodthirsty librarians who want to hire a gorilla camel spotting and prime ministers falling through the earth s crust the longest and most bizarre skit is one where people mysteriously start turning into scotsmen and streaming north of the border soon scotland will be choked with scotsmen and england is pretty much abandoned the culprits tennis playing human devouring blancmanges from the galaxy of andromeda and of course the stuff that has become comedy legend the scene where john cleese tries to return a dead parrot to a pet store it s a stiff bereft of life it rests in peace and the lumberjack song i cut down trees i skip and jump i like to press wild flowers i put on women s clothing and hang around in bars of course no mere description can do justice to the comic brilliance of these dozens of skits these five brits and one american who did the little cartoons created some of the most unabashed naughty nasty and just plain weird comedy ever which still influences everything from saturday night live to author jasper fforde and all of this by men who often dress up as the world s most unattractive girls with only a tiny budget and minimal cast the production values are omnipresent and they are decidedly unpolitically correct but in a weird way these only make it even funnier than it would have been otherwise the writing and acting are pure raw unrefined comedy probably the most memorable actors here are cleese and idle cleese does his psychotic shrieks better than anyone as well as having that rubbery lanky body and howling monkey voice and eric idle does a good job as everyone from a housewife to a wannabe mountain climber while michael palin does a brilliant job as people who are timid or insane by this point the monty python guys had polished up their skits and reached a steady plateau of comic brilliance in other words it s funny and should be watched
0,take some talented actors and put them in an age old story of smart kids versus dumb adults and you get more of the same really is this the type of movie we want to pawn off on our kids they deserve better the key point of this movie is that lying is bad good point a device used to bring out the truth is creative pranks also good unfortunately the pranks fall flat as they are totally implausible even kids will have a hard time believing a man can t tell he s been dyed blue until he looks in the mirror and since they are the device used to bring the movie to its conclusion the entire thing falls flat making films for children is a fine thing they shouldn t be dumbed down or even given an uncritical eye just because they are for children however quite honestly i d rather have a kid watch something like good will hunting before this don t waste your children s time with this film read them a book a good book instead
1,this is the second book in the wind dancer series the wind dancer being the first which was excellent i almost feel as if i liked storm winds even more than the wind dancer and i believe it s due to a more comprehensive abundance of history i was absolutely and totally absorbed with this book from the first chapter until the last one the characters were very individualistic and intriguing i have to say i enjoyed the romance more between the two supporting characters catherine and francois more than the main characters juliette and jean marc i was enamored by francois and his strength steeliness and sensuality jean marc was a dark handsome man as well because of the way juliette was treated in her youth i see why she was so desperate for someone to need her hence her demanding take charge attitude to care for her friend and others catherine was a delight she was soft caring and sweet but her terrible experience made her strong and even more beautiful in nature fascinating characters and historical background i would recommend this book to all those who love romance that isn t the typical dull harlequin type and a love for important historical eras
1,they re lindt and it s a great value need i say more not for traditional milk chocolate lovers though

1,alvin lee is a genius with a guitar nowhere is this more evident than in his mastery of the blues he was and is a great rocker but his true calling is as a bluesman this is a great album
1,i ve loved this movie since the first time i saw it if you like jack nicholson and meryl streep you won t be dissappointed with this movie

1,this episode of star trek the man trap is my earliest memory of what would become a lifelong enjoyment of the franchise truthfully the man trap terrified me i was maybe two or three although i am sure by that time the series was limping along in it s third season and i was seeing a repeat for the first time star trek was considered adult programming and as such i was not allowed to watch it i used to sneak behind the couch while my grandfather watched it on nights i stayed at their house then would lay awake in my bed scared by what i d seen but excited just the same like another space show i enjoyed and was terrified by lost in space i didn t recognize star trek as anything but a world i wanted very much to be in but remained frightened of anyhow i was as i said very young

1,i bought this for my year old grandaughter and am more than pleased it is very heavy so as the child stands up to play it does not move at all the corners are rounded so there are no sharp points for the child to hurt themselves on it will hold their attention for quite a while as there are five activities for them to play with the price was very reasonable compaed to other similar products
1,i bought this game for an adult birthday party it was a hit the game is very entertaining and it is easy to navigate through the game you have full control of the settings such as music level vocals crowd noise etc you can also change the mode to the traditional karaoke in which only the words are displayed on the screen it s definitely for all ages even my two year old can t get enough of it the selection of music is good be sure to have a memory card so you can save any characters you create and keep track of your performance for unlock hidden treasures such as extra songs and wardrobes

1,we have a new keurig coffee maker and just love timothy s coffees any flavor but especially the german chocolate great price too
0,the powershot on switch stopped working right after i started using the camera
1,the music here frequently reminded me of pagan s mind with a touch of porcupine tree and flashes of iron maiden a fantastic mixture of progressive rock bands such as yes and kansas molded with european style power metal and brazilian folk music while this can be extremely interesting there are a few moments here and there that don t quite mesh in actuality i give the cd stars for its superb songcraft and inspired sometimes flawed ambition but as an overall package this special edition of temple of shadows is an excellent place for newcomers as the bonus dvd holds a concert in surround sound that is loaded with songs from their back catalog this is a great album filled with high quality progressive power metal and a dvd concert that gives a taste of their other albums not to mention it s just plain fun to watch as the band members are clearly enjoying themselves smiling throughout the show highly recommended
1,as manufacturers continue to shed unprofitable lines and present one size fits all it becomes increasingly difficult for those of us who wear narrow sizes to find shoes that fit in anything other than the most expensive brands these shoes are well made and an excellent value the only negative is that are made from a wider last and have an internal spacer to make them narrow the heel tends to wallow a little bit in my particular case
0,this is a review of the dvd release thus far as of september the only release i know of of all of the dvds in my collection this has to be one of the most disappointing without going into minute detail of what makes the film brilliant the classic score the hilarious comedy and burton s twisted but brilliant vision the quality of the film transfer to dvd is almost criminal it probably wouldn t be noticed on television screens smaller than inches but on larger screens the picture becomes soft and grainy devoid of detail and utterly perplexing given that the movie was shot in the late s the first thought that sprang to my mind when watching it was that it almost immediately reminded me of my time in elementary school before we switched to video tape the transfer is reminiscent of an old battered film reel i own a s vhs vcr and i have seen better film transfers on video tape additionally the extras well what extras there are several paragraphs of production notes which are basically brief overviews of danny elfman and tim burton but nothing you couldn t gleam from wikipedia in three minutes all that aside i did pay for it at sam s club so the old axiom of getting what you pay for is truer than ever but i expected so much more if you re a beetlejuice fan wait for the inevitable criterion collection or special edition remaster
0,i purchased through work the powershot in july of i ve always owned nikon products personally but the features for the price of the swayed me away from my usual nikon brand loyalty in the months i ve had the it s been sent to the factory twice for repairs the second time was just days before the warranty expired the first time it was sent in was because the lens door failed to turn on the camera and it was almost to come off of its track eight months later the flash quit working in all modes and the door was failing again the flash and door problem occurred while i was in yosemite np so you can imagine the disappointment in being in a place like that with a camera that is only half functioning now the warranty is expired and i hold my breath every time i slide the lens door open i have no faith in the canon and have lost a lot faith in canon products as a whole the only bright side of this experience is that the factory repairs were completed within weeks which i thought was fast for warranty work
0,i have always used the other well known office suites in the past but when i received an offer on this suite at a significant discount i thought i would try it i should mention i m a doctoral student in the middle of a dissertation so the challenge was to migrate important data and documents into wordperfect and quattro pro while i was able to get it done the quattro pro interface with spss which had worked seemlessly with the other spreadsheet failed horribly not to mention the complicated details of what should be simple document formatting the visual basic editor kept freezing or denying me access invest in a better product if you have serious work i ve gone back to the benchmark office suite product
1,when i decided to purchase a weber kettle i knew that a side table was required several reviews have spoken about the table splitting i ordered mine from my local hardware store and when i picked it up i asked about finishing it the hardware folks and this is a really good store gave me a gloss polyurethane finish and very fine sandpaper to prep my work table bottom line take some time and finish this product your local hardware folks will guide you satisfactorily

1,only problem is that it is easy to drop and the scrren smudges easil
0,unfortunately for all the name brand that this book conveys i think the cover seems to be the most intriguing part there are much better ways for book peddling and the fact that a firm such as mckinsey allowed their name on the title of a book for the sake of a few sales boggles this readers mind the subject matter seems to be along the lines of the bull session with all bull and no session no actual quantitative analysis is used throughout the book and if anything more than an encyclopedic definition is learned from this book i would be astounded save some money and go search online for some basic books on beginning valuation by the way those giving stars either can t read english very well or are shills for mckinsey
1,filter and under the radar are the only music magazines i come near i hear mojo is just as informative renovative and enjoyable but i m a little too close minded to care about other genres i don t care much about fans of rock pop what the kids are calling indie alternative punk post punk folk take a gander at this and the covers are slick and durable they don t look out of place sitting on a coffee table
0,very disappointing the shower head itself is massive the size of a small dinner plate it is attached to a long hose which is so flexible it can t support the weight of the head when the shower is in use predictably when you turn on the shower the head drops groundward spewing water in a horizontal spray installs easily but save your money
1,i had heard about this flick being talked about as the chinese charlie s angels it took me a while but i finally popped it in wow this has to be on of the coolest movies i have seen in a while i was expecting a chick flick but maybe that is why i liked it so much the story is about these women who have kind of a stupid backround story but what they do now is assasinate people for a living sweet i am not going to lie i wasn t paying attention to the story what so ever the first time i saw this because of how hot these women are add in a super hot cop who wants to take them down and you have yourself one of the funnest movie ever all of these girls know martial arts or at least they can put their legs up really high and director corey yuen puts in some of the best wirework i have seen this movie certainly isn t going to win any awards for it s high amount of cheese injected in the plot but it is a movie that i wish i could fill my room with about diffrerent screen shot posters so on top of this being an amazingly fun movie yasuaki kurata shows up for the finale corey yuen goes all out with this one and puts together truly one of the best screen battles of all time that will rival any old school kung fu movie if you have seen some of coery s s stuff like yes madam or even the newer fong sai yuk then get ready to be taken back some years when corey did some of the best action sequences in the history of cinema example ninja in the dragon s den kurata plays a great character in my favorite movie ever legend of a fighter which was made in well at years old he looks just as good i was so amazed by this movie i have watched it nights in a row and i will continue this routine for a while the picture quality on the columbia tristar version is perfect and has pretty well written subtitles also good sound cantonese track the original mandarin track and a horrible english dub
0,it smells great like coconut i have long curly hair and it made my hair dry and brittle i ve noticed this with all of the lush conditioners i ve tried so i would not recommend it for naturally curly hair stars for the great smell
1,using this procuct makes changing propane tanks a really quick procedure just remember to pull the outer ring back before installing the male part additional items need to be offered if you are not just ordering an extra one for your weber grill an adapter for the propane retailer to fill your tank the male portion of this quick connect adapter so that other propane appliances can be attached to your tank it doesn t look like it is included as offered the quick connect adapter by itself won t do you any good
1,this cereal taste delicious the chocolate pieces are not supper sweet and the chocolate is rather dark which goes well with the cereal
1,i took my last science course about years ago and had forgotten how interesting science can be this book is not light reading and some people will probably not get past the first few pages but i really enjoyed it i found tons of new information on mushrooms in spite of the fact that i studied mushrooms in college until my father decided science was not for girls and convinced me to go to law school yep those were the good old days you will enjoy it as long as you take into account that it is a scientific book perfect for geeks
0,ordered this knowing it was inexpensive but what i received was worse than expected in part because amazon sent the wrong item spoke with customer service who sent a replacement which they promised would be inspected first however the same wrong item was again sent the problem is the item has been switched with another silver heart locket one even cheesier than the product listed i contacted customer service regarding the replacement they recognize now the real problem and are working to correct eventually both lockets have been returned there didn t seem to be any way of getting the proper locket i wound up ordering a completely different design from another vendor
0,for starters i love bun b and pimp c and ugk and all that but the thing that kills it is lil jon yelling gansta grizzel like times in every track i love lil jon too but they coulda done without it also they just rappin over other peps beats it just sounds like a mixed tape kinda deal but heard rumor that bun b is bout to come out with an offical bun b record not a mixed tape or nothin like that but only reason why i gave it two stars is just cuz they got tight flows on the tracks but not their own beats and lil jon coulda just shut the hell up on those tracks just keepin it real i wouldnt spend the money id just wait for bun b to release his own offical cd or till pimp c get out and ugk hooks it back up
1,i came across the immortal yi soon shin by accident while flicking through some satellite channels up to this time i had never heard of it but immediately i was intrigued by the martial art fight scenes and directing as i continued to watch it had english subtitles fortunately i became enthralled by the acting plot and historical theme with a little detective work i learned that i had caught one of the early episodes of a series with over episodes i told my wife how good it was and after we watched an episode together she and i both became die hard fans and tried to never miss one night of watching it we managed to watch nearly all of the episodes and we both agree that it is the greatest thing we have ever seen on television nearly every episode was better than of the hollywood movies out there if you like action drama amazing three dimensional characters with incredible actors intersting history and some of the best writing i have seen on television or anywhere for that matter check this out
1,it does the basic job well the calibration runs smoothly and accurately hardware looks and feels solid my two completely different brand size and age crt monitors ended up with exactly the same colors sitting side by side user interface is merely adequate pop up help instructions are better than many i have seen you will need to know already how the calibration buttons on your monitors work the hardwired buttons on the monitor not software in order to make any edits you must run the entire time consuming calibration over sometimes you can use back within the calibration sometimes you must start over also the separate profile chooser utility software has not add or delete profile feature even if it is a profile created and saved by the calibration software earlier you can see it with windows display properties but it may not appear in the profile chooser list dual monitors is the one obvious reason to choose pro over plus version yes it does dual monitors but with an asterisk it will create separate profiles but will only apply the correct profiles automatically at startup to both monitors if you have two separate video cards if you have a single video card with dual outputs it will load the same profile the last one you created to both monitors at startup this quirk is documented in a readme file on the installation disk and blames windows for the problem but this limitation appears nowhere in advertising material catalogs or on the box fortunately there is a work around not documented at least with my particular video card and running xp after windows opens you can run profile chooser then choose the correct profile for each monitor you may have to use windows display properties settings to specify default profile and rerun the calibration to get the profiles you want to appear in profile chooser and to select the correct profile as default once it s all set up running profile chooser is a four of five click procedure but you must rememeber to check it before using any application that uses color profiles and check it after you open the application i ve had them change after opening photoshop though not every time

1,i ve been over here in japan for the past years and haven t made too many visits to the states i will be returning next week though however this stuff is definitely one addictive snack in japan it s marketed by the same company as saya endou not a strong flavor just something to munch on not too salty and not too sweet kampeki perfect a purchase of the snack is a victory against terrorism

1,i have had my handspring visor deluxe for yes five years actually longer while i take decent care of it it has taken care of me my doctor has one too exactly like mine and we often talk about how perhaps they should be replaced but the darn thing is still working great and does everything we need it to i finally ordered a new pda with all the capabilities of my laptop and am passing this one on to someone else who needs it i m not selling it good karma down to business the handspring visor deluxe is not the creme de la creme anymore but in its day it was great product and if you don t need the bells and whistles or color display go for this totally flawless people often complain about the styli of other pdas no complaints here not only is it relatively comfortable it is stainless tipped with plastic on both ends doesn t break and it stays securely in place when you store it in the device i literally lost my original stylus just a few days ago the display is not as easy to read as the new super crisp glossy screens that are out now but if you need a basic device with a few bells and whistles that are thrown in for fun heck a good deal of the new ones don t have ir go for it and for the price i just saw it listed for on amazon it s a total steal great product

0,for giving every dance studio and popular dance genre the hope that they too can be the next riverdance the dancers are all talented if self consciously hip and in great shape but the numbers that focus more on t a than fancy footowrk really did this show in for me i love it when risks are taken with conventional dance forms but ballroom dance is ott enough if you ve ever watched a competition and doesn t need to be tarted up beyond recognition the way it is here add the disjointed lighting and editing effects and what you have is a hot mess

1,got this a couple weeks ago the rubber suit covers every bit of the phone so i am confident that i won t be getting any scratched and it flips open a ok you can attach the charger and data cable just fine but the ear peice jack seems a little scrunched you can t access the tf card there is a strap that goes over the top so your definitely isn t going to fall out minor qualms the see through plastic has a little glare on it especially when there is oil between the lcd and the suit also it adds just enough weight that it flips open with a little knock noticed this most when having the phone horizontally mounted on my belt last the flap sort of comes into the field of view of the camera you already know the s camera is crap for its specs but i occasionally have to hold down the little flap i got used to it real quick
1,i am so grateful to all the reviewers of this product for convincing me to give it a try i have a six year old hitachi dvd player and i lost the remote i couldn t play anything without it because the buttons on the player don t allow me to select any tracks the instructions on this remote are incredibly easy it found my tv automatically because it s set for a sony tv by default when i had to locate a code for my dvd player i got worried none of the hitachi dvd codes listed in the manual worked during the setup process but there s a search function to use in that situation which allows you to scroll through all the codes in the chip s library till one works it found one within seconds and i was up and running i think i m going to buy this as a holiday gift for my siblings so they can get rid of all the remotes scattered around their living rooms
0,about the only thing this movie has going for it is the excellent music the producers of this film are out of their mind if they expect any viewer who s not screwed up in the head to feel sorry for the two stupid main characters just because their sick incestuous and adulterous lifestyle is incompatible with the world they live in if you want to leave your entertainment center in a good mood don t watch this
1,the author of the declaration of independence and promoter of a bill of rights for the u s constitution thomas jefferson once wrote i read no newspaper now but ritchie s and in that chiefly the advertisements for they contain the only truths to be relied on in a newspaper letter to nathaniel macon january the nation is not a newspaper rather it is a weekly compilation of informed opinion and investigative reportage that reports what the main stream press and infotainment tv doesn t dare to those americans whose minds have been addled by a steady stream of ideological propaganda and lies call the nation left wing liberal radical etc etc plato had written years ago his allegory of the cave behold human beings living in an underground den which has a mouth open towards the light and reaching all along the den here they have been from their childhood and have their legs and necks chained so that they cannot move and can only see before them being prevented by the chains from turning round their heads plato s punchline was and if he is compelled to look straight at the light will he not have a pain in his eyes which will make him turn away to take refuge in the objects of vision which he can see and which he will conceive to be in reality clearer than the things which are now being shown to him and so dear reader the nation is filled with sunlight that too many americans cannot stand to look into directly it is much less painful for them simply to say the nation s political bias is so far to the left that it repeatedly errors in its evaluations of the american and world situation for those who wish to know the simple truth of what is going on in america and the world read the nation it prints the patriotic incisive truth
0,this product does not do what it advertises does not work at all on my facial hai
1,the edge provides a wealth of knowledge is easy to install as well as use i would love to have given it stars it deserves them but one thing that does not work correctly and really bugs me is the calories expended it couldn t be more inaccurate if they tried to make it that way the first day that i installed it i took it for a quick mile test ride it indicated that in that mile i burned calories wish it were true but it is not unfortunetly the next day i was going to take it out on a mile ride but crashed as i started out and have not riden since days i wore the chest strap in the office today to test the calories burned further after hours it read were burned i just took it for a car ride of miles in those miles driven in a car it indicates i burned nearly calories again i wish but no way other than that flaw whioh i hope they fix with a software update i highly recommend this product it all other ways it is great
1,tazo s lotus decaffeinated green tea is one of my favorite tazo teas the lotus flower flavor is pleasant and delightful this tea is not bitter or harsh in any way it is one of the most natural tasting of the tazo s i ve tasted very subtle and much less artificial tasting the ingredients in lotus are naturally decaffeinated green tea natural lotus flower flavor and other natural flavors of course this tea is caffeine free tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas they are socially responsible based in portland and have the motto the reincarnation of tea tazo is owned by starbucks their web site is fun and quirky with a zen type focus definitely worth checking out it is unclear though from their web site how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher and they do use some natural flavors in their teas this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea on the paper tea packet tazo writes delightfully subtle green tea with the inner radiance and essence of lotus flower on their web site tazo describes the flavor profile of lotus as peach nutty flowery overripe melon this surprisingly full flavored yet delicately floral blend is clean and light bodied with an aroma reminiscent of freesia tazo also describes the aroma as tropical fruit green tea hmmm i don t taste all of these various flavors and i suspect that tazo really pushes the creative writing limit i taste green tea and a nice flowery flavor which i m assuming is the lotus but not the rest the peach nuts melon freesia tropical fruit they re missing from what i can discern here i would rate this tea and tazo in general as good better than premium teas like stash or celestial seasonings but not as good as numi i m soooooo spoiled by numi teas which is why tazo lotus gets only four stars
0,we bought this game yesterday for our daughter the dolls are very difficult for her to dress we have to do it for her also two of the dresses have torn already after playing the game only about times she loves the game and the princesses and it does teach memory but it could be made much better

1,thats really my only complaint with this game every time you buy a racing game the cars all seem to be the same being in australia we had our own fast cars the falcon gtho phase the hk monaro gts and who could forget the torana gtr ok this might mean nothing to someone over in the usa or england but they where supercars in their day that said its still a great game for all petrol heads old and young a lik

0,i just bought this camera and took it to one of my kid s indoor soccer games the light was low but not that low you should be able to take a picture without the flash when i took the flash off the picture looked fine on the preview but came out completely black yet the camera was able to take perfectly fine video at the same light level what a disappointment i am going to try to return it
1,splash is without a doubt among the top romantic comedies of the s that has truly stood the test of time and is still as enjoyable today as it was back then i actually saw this movie when it was first released which is rare for me since i was only a kid back in the s and hardly saw any movies in the theater in those days i first bought it on vhs eventually upgraded to the bare bones dvd and now have upgraded yet again to this anniversary edition dvd i just can t get enough of this movie both tom hanks and daryl hannah have excellent chemistry together and make a great screen couple what s also believable in this movie is daryl hannah s mermaid costume which looks so authentic that one almost believes she s really a mermaid and let s not forget the movie s ending which is absolutely perfect there s one thing about this movie that i ve never understood though how did it ever manage to escape a pg rating in the scene where daryl hannah arrives at the statue of liberty buck naked we get to see quite a substantial and may i add very nice shot of her buns definitely not material for a pg rated movie in any event i guess that will always be a mystery all in all splash is a true classic film that never gets old no matter how many times one sees it everyone is great to watch including hilarious supporting roles by the late john candy r i p and eugene levy now if only they would release a special edition dvd of big another tom hanks classic

0,when i first got the bike i thought it was great by ride the chain broke while i was trying to do a simple down shift unfortunately it also took out the shimano shifter mechanism which equates to big bucks in repair cost looking at the metal used it is no wonder it didn t last very poor quality too bad because it is a great looking bike i guess i ll give wal mart a try next

1,it is the best backpack i have ever seen
1,this movie is all about entertaining the combination between die hard and typical martial arts flick works in many levels but the production values are hong kong s don t miss that point fans of jet li are welcome but action fans be careful here we can find scale helicopters burst in flames exploding building models chopped off dummies you name it the characters are extreme in their own context jet li is a former military now becomed bodygard and stunt actor loyal gentleman honorable deadly you know a portrait of the typical good guy the bad guys are also extremely violent and cool looking he doesn t fight or kick much in this film but he shoots a lot dodging bullets from a dozen bad guys with machine guns with no scratch at all his revolver shoots bullets without reloading he drives a car inside a hall and uses the elevator that happens to be be the right size well you have to be in the right mood to watch this film without laughing at the many cartoonish production mistakes but if you are into hong kong low production values action films you will really enjoy one of the best ones of the s by the way this dvd edition sucks english dubbed subtitles poor sound and no extras not even a filmography
1,this is my first plasma tv and i love it we bought this to put the icing on the cake after having remodeled our complete house the tv sounds great and looks great hdtv is stunning i am very pleased with my purchase and would recommend this tv to anyone
0,the cheaper variety at walmart versus and up no boundaries brand is better for me due to the fact that they are harder and more firm more like a birkenstock cork sole which i also find very comfortable for me anyway they do last longer too and are not affected by heat in any way walmart also has a real color explosion going on you can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself so for the cheaper price walmart offers i feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there if you are looking for a firm birkestock type sole the no boundaries brand croc is a shoe in no pun intended
1,what a great time you can have in rome the basic gameplay is intuitive there isn t a lot you haven t done before the interface is pretty standard and can be minimized off the screen for screenshots or just zooming around without distraction as with all these types of games you can spend a lot of time building and developing you need to take some time enjoying this one for the closeup views of the city at work and at play is what is so new here the graphics look somewhat standard on a zoom out top down view there is a lot that looks familiar until you start to get a closer look and the texture details come to life and you realize there is another level of realism here as you watch the shadows lengthen along the plaza near the sparkling fountain as the midday sun moves across the sky and the trees sway in the breeze wow no other roman game out currently comes close this has everything you always wanted with caesar iii and had somewhat with cotn children of the nile although the buildings here are more substantial and better realized i would have liked to see more decorative options and more variety in housing and goods you can produce it s part of the appeal and adds to the longevity and continued interest in the game but what there is is very good indeed all of the structures are beautifully done with attention to detail the landscape can be breathtaking with a variety of ways to put your city together around the terrain and enough hustle and bustle on the city streets to bring it to life and did i mention that you can zoom all the way down into an arena or colliseum watch closeups of the games or swivel around from the floor of the arena and watch all the spectators coming in and out and moving around or cheering a lot of thought went into this game by people who love what they do there are some bugs with the trade routes hopefully these will be addressed soon in the meantime avoid placing the ports or depots before you have goods in stock for those routes the maps are overall somewhat small although a game this graphic intensive would have to reasonably limit the size to facilitate performance there are very limited sandbox modes available at least for now and i can find no user created scenarios currently available due in part to the complexity of the unsupported editor i am currently running a mid line gaming system with a nvidia a system that can run oblivion fairly well i had to update some drivers as well as defragment my hard drive to run this game smoothly i hadn t experienced many lags until i had built up a larger city or had been playing for several hours and my system started to protest while it may have a few faults most things are a matter of preference and having an adequate clean system the core game itself is fundamentally solid it takes work to build up economic stability based on trade and taxes and how well you handle your production chains you can create with any scenario stable cities that will largely run themselves aside from the requests demands from the empire with the stable gameplay depth realistic economic simulation great music and breathtaking graphics it s not only a very good game but the best of the current selection of roman city builders so if you have to chose i would recommend this one first enjoy
1,i purchased the tui shampoo and conditioner and although it is watery it lathers very well and leaves your hair squeaky clean i wear my hair natural with no chemicals and it held my natural curls in place the entire day my hair did not dry out nor did it become poofy all day i love carol s daughter and i am thankful for her products

1,i lived in japan for many years really enjoyed using these noodles in soups stir fry korean style cooking etc if you are looking for pasta these may not exactly match your craving but are nonetheless really versatile my advice for those who don t like the smell upon opening the package is to drain them sprinkle liberally with salt rub through with clean hands then rinse in cold water this is how they prepare them in japan it removes any odor they are ready to use
0,i wouldn t buy it again i like to try to new things and i had never had this before but it wasn t that good yes my crew ate it they eat almost anything this isn t moving
1,the sandisk reader is impossible to misuse it loads quickly and it s compact shape offers most options for memory it can be mounted vertically with attached stand for sleek ease of use or compacted flat to be discreet i would prefer a little more weight so that it doesn t move around on my desk so i m giving it only stars if i had to replace this reader i would buy another sandisk
0,i am completely frustrated and upset with the delivery or lack thereof of the magazine subscription i received as a gift of romantic homes this is my absolute favorite magazine and my husband purchased a year s subcription for me from amazon com for christmas i still haven t received one magazine it s now july amazon assured me three times over the past year it was coming it s now july and i still haven t received the magazine i am so disappointed at the lack of customer service i urge you to never buy a magazine subscription from amazon com this has been a horrible experience and i cannot believe that it has somehow become okay to run a business in this matter i am tired of empty promises from amazon com while i am anxiously awaiting my magazine not only have i not received my magazine the people at amazon have never offered a refund a renewed subscription anything i realize it s a measly twenty something dollars but this business practice is horrible i am also tired of speaking to people that do not speak english and are trying to help me please do better amazon this is terrible shame on you
1,great magazine but don t subscribe here you can do it online at her website or tear out the order form in a magazine and it will cost less
1,here s the deal i was looking for a good way to move the oil filter to a different place under the hood and this kit did the job perfectly the filter on my son s car is on the side of the engine block nissan and located right above a section of the frame that has holes in the top every time i remove the filter the oil drains out of the filter and enevitably into the frame a big wad of shop rags or towels under the filter helps but not always then i ve got oil draining from the frame for the next week making a mess all over the driveway anyway the pump thing with the drain tube running from the pan is unique but not what i bought the kit for i only used the filter relocator was impressed with the quality of the fittings and the hoses and everything hooked up like they said it would the big plus though it s about one third the cost of any other kit out there including those listed on amazon com and it comes with adapters to fit just about any car been on the car now for about months with no problems and has made changing the filter sooooo much easier and cleaner in fact decided to buy another kit from amazon for my own car
1,it opens with a tribute to h g wells and ends with an homage to jules verne in the middle are more stories that span from side to side of the sf spectrum and even though they might not be all in the reader s preferences are sure worth reading if not thought provoking talking about preferences i can t help mentioning terry bisson s in the upper room and damon knight s life edit as the best of the lot look forward for number and and
0,the look and feel of this camcorder is very good unfortunately my camcorder use is limited to low light indoor activities for example evening party indoor school activities kid drama and orchestra this camcorder is not at all suitable for these activities earlier i had a sony dcr which was way better than this camcorder this camcorder has a very small sensor and hence such a low price one easy guide to evaluate the sensor size is to look at the optical zoom most of the camcorders with more than optical zoom has small sensors these large optical zoom camcorders will perform poorly in low light if you are planning to use this camcorder in low indoor light i do not recommend it
0,this product will not fix your disc i tried to fix a damaged cd and it only made the problem worse i ended up throwing away the cd and the skipdoctor this is a poorly designed and manufactured product that does not work i wish someone would have told me this before i spent money on it
1,yeah i found out the hard way about the non waterproofness of it i was using my fountain pen to write in a lab notebook and as will happen in labs water got on it kinda fails the point of lab notebooks which is to document permanently what you do going to go drop a bit more money on waterproof ink interestingly my accidental paper chromatogram revealed that the black ink separates into blue and yellow pigments i m a little annoyed about this as i used quink before and it seemed to be at least somewhat water resistant that bottle i got back in malaysia so it might be a different formulation
1,i bought this toy guitar for my year old grandson and he fell in love with it it looks just like a real guitar in fact he put it in his dad s guitar stand it can t be tuned like a grown up s but for a year old and considering the inexpensive price tag it s just fine if he continues to show an interest in music i will buy him a better one i will definitely shop at austin bazaar again they were better than advertised
0,never in my life have i been so outraged by what i have read as by the drivel spouted by dr west in this book in his translator s note and by the use of unponderingly and the thinkery among other things in his translation of the clouds i also read his translation of plato s apology of socrates and found it grossly inferior to jowett four texts on socrates is not a book to be tossed aside lightly it should be hurled with great force apologies to dorothy parker not only are the translations themselves inexcusably inept almost everything that he writes in his translator s note is wrong the clouds is a play not a scientific or mathematical treatise as such it has characters and dialogue a modern translation of a play must be something that could be presented on a stage and make sense to a modern audience if a character is supposed to be bizarre or out of the ordinary one does not make him spout drivel such as unponderingly one gives him a shtick which is a theatrical term it s more or less a running gag associated with a particular character you create through clever ways of speaking or odd ways of stringing his words together a characterization he could be made to speak like a parody of william f buckley or the star wars character yoda as it stands west s text cannot be presented as a play it is neither necessary nor useful to coin such nonsense as unponderingly indeed it is inexcusable it conveys neither humor nor cleverness it comes off simply as stupid the translator of a play must know something about theatre and drawing characters which dr west obviously does not to state it bluntly the translation of plays should be left to people who understand theatre and characterization and who are creative dr west doesn t have a creative bone in his body in regard to his translation of plato s the apology of socrates the translation by dr west is both original and good but the parts that are good are not original and the parts that are original are not good after all when one has the work of such a brilliant predecessor as benjamin jowett to follow the temptation to do something entirely different is strong but it must be resisted if dr west had merely lightly revised jowett s great work he would have made a contribution to learning alas he did neither the version by jowett is clearly superior here is a short excerpt and i must beg of you to grant me a favor if i defend myself in my accustomed manner and you hear me using the words which i have been in the habit of using in the agora at the tables of the money changers or anywhere else i would ask you not to be surprised and not to interrupt me on this account for i am more than seventy years of age and appearing now for the first time in a court of law i am quite a stranger to the language of the place and therefore i would have you regard me as if i were really a stranger whom you would accuse if he spoke in his native tongue and after the fashion of his country am i making an unfair request of you never mind the manner which may or may not be good but think only of the truth of my words and give heed to that let the speaker speak truly and the judge decide justly compare west s inept version i do very much beg and beseech this of you if you hear me speaking in my defense with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak both in the marketplace at the money tables where many of you have heard me and elsewhere do not wonder or make a disturbance because of this for this is how it is now is the first time i have come before a law court at the age of seventy hence i am simply foreign to the manner of speech here so just as if i really did happen to be a foreigner you would surely sympathize with me if i spoke in the dialect and way in which i was raised so also i do beg of you now and it is just at least as it seems to me leave aside the manner of my speech for perhaps it may be worse but perhaps better and instead consider this very thing and apply your mind to this whether the things i say are just or not for this is the virtue of a judge while that of an orator is to speak the truth speaking with the same speeches i am accustomed to speak how utterly inept and repetitive didn t he even proof read one doesn t speak with speeches one speaks with words it is obvious that dr west never read his version aloud as a test of its appropriateness which is surprising because this work is supposed to be a speech dr west s version is clearly not suited to speaking aloud whereas jowett s is in west s translation socrates is a clumsy repetitive and inept speaker needlessly so if you want to read a good translation see jowett s edition why does dr west believe himself qualified to make translations nothing in his work suggests that he is competent in any way to do so this is not the work of a scholar but that of a bungling hack these translations are travesties how does work this nauseatingly bad get published not recommende

0,i only ordered this because my child was begging for the swimming mermaid i compared amazon s listing with the manufacture listing and ordered we did not get what we ordered we got a barbie dressed in a mermaid costume not the swimming one this was from santa and i m sorry but seeing that type of disappointment in a six year old s eyes just breaks your heart of course it was after the packaging was torn apart to get her out and into eager hands for the first time in my years of shopping i feel robbed
1,when i buy flash memory i consider price speed manufacturer and vendor i got this particular memory stick for a sonyericsson phone i paid extra to get it from amazon no they don t always have the best price this way i am confident that i can return it if i got the wrong one or have a problem with it the card works fine in my phone and since i have a usb cable that hooks up to the phone i don t have to be concerned about removing the card to use a card reader i have not yet experienced any problems with sandisk memory products i am told that the sandisk sticks are faster than sony s but i have no way to confirm this nor do i know if my phone player camera is able to take advantage of faster speeds the longest process is transferring music to the phone and i wasn t in a hurry anyway this stick comes with an adapter to use with the older memory stick format so i can use the stick that i replaced in my sony camcorder which had a stick in it no it s not a typo it s actually a megabyte memory stick
1,as other reviewers have stated this watch is large and it s heavy i think it would look best on a larger person with big wrists or arms the night light is cool and effective
0,i have moderate knowledge of computers etc and i found this overly complicated this is not intended for the novice however even if you are not a novice it seems to still be a waste of money i wish i had not bought it at all perhaps it has secrets and treasures i am not aware of but the directions are complicated and it would be by chance that you would ever discover them save your money this was a waste
1,i have used medium sized kongs as a breakfast lunch dinner bucket for our bichon for over five years i stuff it with a dried liver treat a combination of eukanuba and max and a medium dog bone his five to eight trips a day for kong refills provides a break from my sedentary home office activities recently i had collapsed lung surgery and now use the filling of kongs for a six minute treadmill break he now joins me on the treadmill for about the first three minutes before jumping off to work on his latest kong kongs are a lasting feature in our lives the amazon provider of a two years supply of kongs was excellent and very competitively priced i recommend both the kong and supplier at a star level
1,we have gone through a few packages of the table toppers and we love them our toddler went from trying to peel them off the table to helping us stick them down she loves to pull the paper strips off the adhesive and she doesn t try to pull the mat off the table until she is finished eating we finally found the shopper toppers at toys r us and i was so excited i bought two packages and they don t work worth anything the adhesive on those is down the sides not across the top where it should be to stick on the shopping cart handle in fact we ve decided that the table toppers will work better on the shopping cart than the ones made for the shopping cart also with only a shopper topper in our bag while out for lunch recently we used it on the table and it worked just as well at the ones made for the table well done
1,just received it this week replacing my nokia with this model the photos are much better both have optical carl zeiss lenses but this is mp vs on the also the covers all radio bands making the reception on my cingular coverage very very strong everywhere supposedly two internal antennae the lacked one of the frequency ranges used by cingular so depending on the city i was in i occasionally had very spotty coverage the symbian operating system in the is faster than the older version on the and best of all it is much more compact than the fits nicely in the palm of my hand and in my jeans pocket last there is a very smooth operating lense cover on the back of the phone protecting the camera lense why aren t they all like this as usual the flash isn t the equivalent of even a moderate digital camera but otherwise i see this phone as the best of both worlds
1,this writting instrument is superb in it s ability to compensate the energetic writer
1,while the history is cool the extent to which everyone drinks the kool aid and gobbles it up is a bit startling to me i suppose that those people who still care enough about the physical writing experience of pen to paper might be more inclined to romanticize it in other words not only great notebooks see below but also smart marketing and more power to them i also enjoy writing but with respect to the little x books on a purely practical level i like these simply because there are very few notebooks out there that provide such a high quality writing experience in such a small volume of space the little x softcover is almost ideal for shoving in your back pocket and carrying everywhere with nice high quality paper the covers are durable and smooth enough to still work well even after acquiring some character in your back pocket ie they actually mold to your a bit i haven t tried a fountain pen in it although i enjoy writing with them i wouldn t use one in this application anyway these little books are not really for writing the great american novel or the great novel of your country of origin they re more for jotting notes or to do lists and they work extremely well in this role the only reason i withhold one star is the lack of a feature that would make them completely perfect for me a pen attachment enclosure provision my ideal book would be able to accomodate a thin pen in the spine so that the book could be slid into my pocket easily with no fear of snagging or worry about whether i remembered to click the pen to retract it i realize this would make it a bit bulkier though as it is my leading pen choices for this are the fisher space pen or the zebra g medium point gel retractable the former being very very short but a bit thicker when capped and the latter being very nice and skinny but longer anyway these notebooks are a pleasure to use and though a bit costly for how long they last me and the pleasure and utter utility i get from using them they seem like a reasonable extravagance to me i ll go through many many of these before i spend what i would on the cheapest pda
1,it cost times its price just to ship i didn t really expect to be amazed but it is sturdy if plain the sheath doesn t really make it a decent wall display but i think it will out last any cheap show sword
0,three years after the first mortal kombat film fans couldn t wait for annihilation to come out unfortunately the sequel did not do well at the box office and after viewing it i can see why first i will start with what is positive about the movie kitana had more of a role as did jax i preferred sandra hess as sonya a little over bridget wilson even though she did a good job with sonya s character in the first movie some of the fight scenes jax vs cyrax sonya vs mileena liu kang vs baraka sub zero vs scorpion were sequenced good the dvd bonus features were nice and the soundtrack was awesome these positive aspects however could not save the overall film from disappointment so what went wrong like the first mk annihilation attempted to blend two mortal kombat games into one movie mortal kombat and ultimate mortal kombat unlike the first mk however the blend was not successful too many characters were put into the movie and therefore the character development for most of them was almost non existent aside from that only three of the actors to my knowledge returned from the previous movie though it is understandable why the other actors did not return what else went wrong with this sequel some of the acting was either over the top and or downright pitiful shao kahn s character along with raiden s character was poorly resembled also some of the characters didn t even get much screen time at all one flaw that is immediately noticed at the beginning of the movie is that one of the main characters gets killed off i won t say who because it is probably obvious while some of the fight sequences were good most of them were rushed and some were just flat out ridiculous this goes double for the animality sequence sadly mk annihilation doesn t rank up with the first one despite all this there is some good news after eight long years of waiting a third mortal kombat film will hit the big screen with most of the actors returning from the first movie plus the third installment will not only kontinue where the first left off but will also ignore the events of annihilation

1,this is a good introduction to many off the beaten paths of america in fact the real star of the show asie from the ubiquitous red ford taurus is the scenery of america itself the camera and narrator takes the viewers to many places that have unique characteristics unfortunately there is no interaction with the locals so we do not get a truely complete coverage of each scene but the point of the series is to give a reader s digest view of places people can visit but excellent photography and the knack for finding out of the way events are the hallmark of this series each trip is actually a roundabout path that is really serveral family vacations combined into a one hour program this is a great cure for cabin fever in the midst of a winter snowstorm
1,francis ford coppola s apocalypse now is a pure example of method filmmaking it is the true craftmanship of an essential filmmaker the art direction editing and sound effects are partially a small fragment which makes this film classical and memorable what drives the integrity and semblance of the film is the storyline acting and inner message the inner message evidently enough is that war is hell or in other words hell is war not many directors have the ambition or the true courage to establish such a well defined piece of art european filmmakers wouldn t have the slightest problem of directing the film or throw in their personal feelings about the war what is most interesting is that an american filmmaker spoke his style and the style of the film s collaborators through the continuance of the film the plot is fairly simple and brief adapted by joseph conrad s heart of darkness martin sheen plays the role of captain willard a war torn character who does not see any hope in life or humanity anymore he has a mission and it is to capture a presumed colonel kurtz marlon brando who has fabricated an army of existensial soldiers on the outskirts of the cambodian jungle throughout the film we encounter astonishing sequences the most unforgettable is the dawn helicopter attacks robert duvall s character colonel kilgore is a steady and firm example of the basic american army brain to search and destroy and then destroy some more if it includes yourself the children walk about the playground oblivious to any danger the helicopters come into view from the dawning sea millions of sprinkle reflect from the water we hear the helicopter s engines roar from the horizon and soon enough we are stuck in a messy attack throughout the sequence we hear wagner s ride of the valkyries it is method filmmaking the starting sequence is as fascinating as the rest of the movie a beautiful scene of palm trees blowing in the ragged wind and seconds away from being inflamed with a carpet bombing let s not forget the scene where the soldiers of the boat in which sheen travels in stop an innocent upcoming boat suspecting them to be vietcongs and carrying artilleries then they spark off a heavy scene of shooting in which all of the passengers of the boat are pulverised to pieces with their crops and food savaged in the atrocity this film has its famous moment some better to be kept quiet about until they come through the screen it doesn t require any intellectual understanding although the film is intellectually remarkable the american soldiers in the vietnam war jumped into the land of a fresh governmental country aiming to protect themselves and in the end only received death and chaos for their troops and for the majority of the country they were fighting against it was a war gone mad like all other wars without purpose or dignity it was a pure act of humanity to destroy and restore their own greedy needs this is a film in which there is no saviour where it is hardly possible to find hope in the gloomiest corners and where all surroundings are plagued with the infatuations of greed anger foolishness and egoism as coppola once said about the film this film isn t about vietnam this film is vietnam he was right to the date during the current situations of the world where they are trying to protect their own skin the world should try to analyse this film as much as possible and wonder about what it is trying to represent it is a film which does not ask for applause or damnation it asks for realism enjoy
1,if you don t use this phone it costs month normal hours til p m it s cents per minute which is a bit less than half of what most prepaid phones cost perfect for my occasional use and for locating family members when i m in transit and feel that i simply must know where they are and what they are doing i don t use cell phones much but if i must have one i might as well have one that doesn t make me worry about another huge bill for kids who think they can mangle the budget forget it cuz when the card is used up that s it kiddo once they use up the card the only number they can dial is but that s it bonus features clock is always accurate and it has a great alarm which tells me when to get up to go to work and another to tell me when to go home at the end of the day at some point i might not be able to live without this
1,we researched for a secure and good value inversion table and decided to buy this model this is a very low price for such a good quality inversion table the ankles are comfy and secure the dvd shows how to incline gradually and adjust it just right as you assemble it you can notice that there is little room for something to go wrong from its good engineering design the best part is using it it feels so good to feel your spine expanding and blood flowing to new areas i can t wait to use it again we love it
1,i loved the idea and ease of the senseo but i was never that crazy about the way the coffee tasted the grocery stores do not offer much in the way of variety so i decided to take a chance and order the columbia blend from amazon i have been very happy with the flavor of it compared to what i had been getting if you are up for a change and want a smoother flavor but still a strong tasting coffee give it a try i will note that the bag only comes with pods vs in the regular bags
1,simply put xenogears xenosaga is the absolute best storyline and best role playing experience on the to date i do strongly believe that xenosaga has the best storyline in any rpg i have ever ever played including final fantasy xenogears and hundreds of others because rpgs are strongly reliant on storyline for gameplay i consider this to be the pinnacle of role playing on the final fantasy x comes close as does star ocean but in terms of storyline this game beats them however i did have to mark down for a few other minor flaws this game is highly a niche game only for those who enjoy the style and the sci fi setting it s also very short hours if you play straight through no leveling up maybe hours if you take up the side quests and want a strong character gameplay the first xenosaga highly relied on cut scenes and narrative in fact i absolutely could not stand the battle system xenosaga episode still relies heavily upon that storytelling through hours of cut scenes but it fixes the battle system the battle system is simply put one of the most fun turn based systems i have ever experienced while xenosaga episode s battle system seemed slow and unwieldy episode has a fast paced action packed and highly challenging battle system you have characters on the screen at just about all times these characters can be switched off in a manner much like ffx but it costs a turn in this game causing it to be more tactical each turn you have many options you can attack more on various attacks later stock save a turn for the next turn in order to get a combo use ether read magic or change your battle party if you choose to attack there is a whole slew of options here as well most importantly is learning the weak points of the enemy every enemy including bosses have a certain attack combination that will be most effective against them when you attack you can press either square which is a b zone attack triangle which is a c zone attack or circle which is another b zone attack certain characters also have an a zone attack but this is only against flying opponents you must expierament with the enemies in order to learn the zones they are weakest in sometimes you may be required to stock for a turn in order to attack the enemy in its weak zone what is the advantage of attacking weak zones you ask well it allows for large scale damage pounding comboes that are absolutely essential in this game once you have hit all of the enemy s weak zones you can do a break on them this involves the circle button once a character is broken they can be tossed into the air or attacked while prone on the ground this can add up to tons of damage if you plan your boosting right boosting is another integral part of the combat system pressing the button brings up a slot meter which is sometimes empty but it may feature the character potraits of some of your characters if you press and then the button square triangle or circle that that character s potrait is on they will boost forward and immediately after the acting unit has taken its turn this new character will have a turn enemies however can take advantage of all of these systems as well if you do not plan well or randomly attack without comboes the enemy will break you boost ahead several times and can easily destroy one of your characters in one short brutal assault countless times my entire party was destroyed by simple enemies that should have been no problem merely because i did not plan ahead you will get very very used to seeing the game over screen the plus side of this difficulty is that you feel real exhiliration when you win it is a great accomplishment note that even with power levelling it won t help you much in some situations believe me i tried finally there is ether ether skills are basically magic if you know anything about rpgs at all then you know basically what is present here healing ether skills attack ether skills nothing big i forgot to mention the e s units these are basically mechs and were called a g w s in episode many points in the game involve you using these to move around and fight and now they have an independant battle system it s basically the same as the one with your characters on screen except that you only have one attack a turn no comboes or anything like that it is just an added piece of fun to an already awesome game there is a skill system in place after every battle you earn class pointss and or skill points these can be spent on getting new ether skills or new upgrades to your characters that can make them more resilient when you equip them every character has the same skill set and this is a minor flaw that slightly brings down the gameplay score but not the overall enjoyment in the least finally one other flaw with the gameplay is that there are no weapons and no armor both of these are rpg standard fare and it seems kind of odd to not have either this may just be something the developers decided not to do that i disagree with but it still seems a little odd note that this really does not detract from the game in any way in xenosaga they also opted to add a lot more puzzle solving than episode had the interesting thing is that these puzzles while challenging don t take away from the gameplay expierience at all in fact i found many to be very enjoyable the storyline of this game is simply incredible but keep in mind that it is basically required that you have beaten xenosaga episode if you want to understand it at all or at least be acquainted with the story in some manner if you haven t played it the best way is to get the bonus dvd that came with the game there are probably some somewhere around maybe even on ebay that allows you to see hours of cut scenes from the original this can substitute in for those who dont want to spend the hours required on xenosaga episode to beat it anyway i digress xenosaga s storyline is more of the space opera fun often times i got very emotional and the game can tug on your heartstrings in the ending sequence of the game a spectacular event lasting about minutes i was seriously in tears this game can do that to you the storyline is that good it is also filled with entrigue betrayal new discoveries and new secrets it is truly incredible i have seen certain reviews that say the storyline doesn t solve everything it doesn t solve all the mysteries let me tell you something it s not supposed to xenosaga is going to be a part series and the storyline is continuous it makes no sense at all to have the story be complete in only episode ii i see no reason why anyone could possibly complain about it graphics the graphics of xenosaga are basically the same as they were in episode no real improvements at all they are still great though and the cut scenes are gorgeous my one real complaint here is that the lip sync is sometimes off a problem with just about every rpg with voice overs and some of the environments are a little dull this is made up for in the environments that are simply breathtaking sound the soundtrack of xenosaga episode is godlike from the opening theme to the battle music to the catchy japanese sounding tunes that ring in your head forever this music is incredible the voice acting is also absolutely superb i have zero complaints this is a rarity sound effects are also very appropriate and very well done value the game is hurt in the value department only because of its length to put it in perspective the first playthrough took me about hours but more like if you count all the times i died and had to go back to the point i got killed at after you win you can use your game clear file to access even more goodies like some bonus bosses dungeons and side quests and this helps make up for the shorter length personally i think its the best i have ever spent tilt finally the overall enjoyment this game is simply the most enjoyable game i have played on the i completed it after several all night gaming sessions and it will most likely keep you up too the role playing experience here is superb the storyline is possibly the best in rpg history and the battle system is incredible and in depth there is virtually nothing not to like as an avid rpg gamer i recommend this game as highly as is possible however there are a few things to consider can you handle the challenge and do you like the space opera anime feel if you answered yes to both get this game

0,i bought this item thinking it would be compatible with the sony ericsson this model is listed in the description first off the cd that comes with the data cable does not have my phone model on it making it useless i figured this would be no problem because the software for my phone is available from sony ericsson s website after downloading the software and following the instructions to a tee i was still unable to link up my computer with my phone i even uninstalled and reinstalled the software again in case i made an error all told this was a waste of money and one of my first disappointments with dealing with amazon
0,why are you paying such good money for a no calorie water how many calories does water have to begin with it would be interesting to see what the placebo was that they used in the double blind trial a cheeseburger please do not buy this fill a bottle up at home and squeeze a bit of lemon juice in if you have to no calories give the money that you would have spend to charity the makers of this water are thieves and con artists
0,i bought these for my year old mom she loves jewelry and helped me pick these out we thought it would be a good deal for the price she was happy with the look of the stones when they arrived but as others have noted these stones are mounted at the end of a rather deep mount almost inch which makes them rather top heavy unless you have very thick and meaty ear lobes these earrings are going to droop downwards not sit pretty on your ear as you would expect needless to say my moms ear lobes are very thin as soon as she put them in her ears they drooped downward at a degree angle she was very displeased with these and we sent them back for a refund
0,awful i mean really awful and i liked self portrait because you knew dylan was just trying to have some fun with his image this album is just a disaster the lyrics are ok on most songs i ve seen worse by dylan but the music is unexciting not very creative and downright embarrassing on some tracks why oh why did you have to make an album like this bob such talented people at your disposal for these sessions and you threw it away on garbage arrangements shameful really sad
1,these shoes wear well and match nicely with jeans giving you a nice fresh look they also are easy on the feet i like the suede versions best personally but when winter hits its best to have the leather
1,i love this item it really works well in february winter weather i bought snowsuits and i haven t used one for our newborn because snowsuits are tedious i am able to put her in her car seat put a blanket inside and put a hat on her forget the suits and mittens i cover her with the cover and she sleeps in the dark and warmth soundly also it prevents people from touching her all of the time because they can t see her when i cover her up the only problem is that this item didn t fit well with the newest peg perego infant car seats i made it work but it doesn t fit perfectly it worked with the old peg perego car seat but not the newest one i loved this item so much that i ve made it work though it isn t perfect but it works it actually is so much better than peg perego s cover which came with the car seat this cover has made my life pretty easy i found it easy to put on the peg perego i love the color it zips up easily it is soft isabella seems to like to snuggle in it it is comfy for her be aware though i live in salt lake city ut our winters are mild if you have colder winters you may want to add a snowsuit still it is worth the money i am glad i bought it
0,i haven t even got to play it yet because the game does not work on my after the logo comes up the screen goes blank and nothing happens i thought it was maybe just that disc but i exchanged it and the same thing happened i called ubisoft and they said many people with the slim have called to say it doesn t work but they don t have any answers sony said that it is an error in the format of the discs and it may not work in many s do not buy if you don t want the risk of it not working
1,was shopping at the mall this item caught my husband s eye in the window we went into the store to inquire more of what it was and it s uses we actually bought one for ourselves it came in handy when we went on a trip to the mainland going and returning home especially since the airlines are quite strict with the luggage weight i was quite worried our bags would be in excess weight with all the shopping we did but it wasn t we foud that to use the scale is compact enough for it to be placed in one of the luggages it s a two man operation my husband would lift the luggage bag then i would look at the scale quickly
0,i am an avid fan of true crime books and this is by far the most one sided book i ve ever read it wasn t about the crimes it was about this author s personal feelings and dislike of aileen wuornos he has a real problem with women lesbians in particular he made ms wuornos out to be someone she wasn t she had a hard life yes and chose to committ crimes but that wasn t what this book was about again it wasn t worth the i actually threw my copy of this away
0,i have been a subscriber to time for over years and before that a reader of my parents subscription it pains me to say that this magazine has forgotten what it is about frankly the only issues worth their salt are those resulting from a major world event such as a natural disaster or a terror attack such events seem to energize an otherwise listless staff of seemingly bored editors and newswriters a newsweekly has the obligation to go beyond the newspapers to use the extra couple days to provide a more balanced and analytical view unfortunately time fixes its editorial position at the beginning of a story any future coverage is designed to prove time s initial position correct the immediate taking of an editorial position is then carried into all future coverage of the event stifling analysis and preventing any analytical development beyond the first few stories we told you so we told you so even worse the coverage of a lengthy story peters out until something sensational happens at which point the sensational event becomes the ultimate interpretation of the entire story can t the magazine occasionally admit it was wrong rather than turning its eye away from the story that continues to burn out of sight out of mind is the mantra in fact i sometimes debate whether the decline of this magazine mirrors or outpaces the general decline in our media newspapers are failing television news can t seem to get away from the gory or sensationalistic even academic journals have specialized themselves into irrelevance we seem to have a greater appreciation for comedy than analysis neutrality is dead frankly i don t care so much about any perceived editorial slant as i do about the fact that the magazine is increasingly boring and irrelevant time used to have excellent coverage of trends and events outside of the united states no more iran is building nuclear weapons but merits the occasional blurb on a world summary page african states are making vast strides towards democracy we get an article about nigerian computer fraud russia is emerging from the turmoil of perestroika and its painful transition has much to teach about the costs and value of democracy but we seem to focus only on the latest roadbomb in iraq japan one of the world s most influential cultures in the week i originally wrote this review see month subscription merited only a snippet regarding a royal marriage and an analysis of foreign intrusion into sumo wrestling somewhere in the wide world is a fascinating place or culture to which time could send a correspondent and bring the place and people alive to its readership instead we get tabloid excrement in the nature of joel stein s puerile take on pornography and social deviants but most damning is the fact that after reading time one asks how in the hell did our world become boring can time try emulating the economist rather than the enquirer someone needs to step in and restore the proud tradition of complete and in depth coverage educate the reader about the world in which we live don t wait until either natural disasters or internal politics shine the spotlight on any of the various cultures and countries in which real and interesting events take place every single week time has the history and potential of being a five star magazine if only it would just focus on finding and reporting the news
1,they looks nice and fit really well however not so soft like some other clarks indigo
0,i love the workout dvd that comes with it but the ball developed a slow leak after only a few uses very disappointed with this product
1,this is a great game for two players and two players only the first one or two times i played it was very very slowgoing because there is a lot to take in however once you adapt to the numerous cards and they become familiar to you games tend to take about an hour it s a fairly involved game so you have to be in the mood for that there s a lot of strategy and many ways to win i greatly recommend it for those who already enjoy playing games it might be daunting for a really casual gamer though if you like it there are now expansion sets available that add lots of spice and variety to the original
1,better than any club shop product perfect for the new golfer and light enough my son did not get tired carrying them for holes
1,frazee s comical guide for babies of all ages has a subconscious message behind the humor meanwhile encouraging those first few steps that will open up a universe of new experiences baby leaving the shelter of the familiar for the unknown the roly poly baby illustrated is tiny compared to everything around him objects taller than him but once he pulls himself up and begins that first tentative journey it is impossible to stop of course there are a few cautions along the way be careful of things that are wobbly stay away from fragile stuff there are the usual setbacks too much too soon and a tumble to the floor followed by a howl and the effort to being again cleverly worded and cheerfully illustrated this tongue in cheek guide is a delight offering more food for thought than is first apparent luan gaines
0,i wanted a new computer so a couple months ago i ordered an hp computer that happened to have vista on it i thought oh great i ll get the newest os as well major mistake didn t work with my perhipherals including my scanner and an hp printer for god s sake the computer s an hp why won t it work with an hp printer if they knew the drivers for perhipherals weren t ready why the did they release the os and force us to buy it annoying security feautres constantly asking permissions to install software just like the apple ads a total joke after struggling with the damn thing for days i decided to try to install old trusty xp on it later guess what you cant install an earlier operating system booting from the cd doesn t work either you get the blue screen of death maybe some tech geek can do it but i m done wasting time with this thing all that agony for what the fancy interface who cares what it looks like i just want to use my damn scanner i m sure all those slick effects suck up ram and resources for what functional purpose just to look more like mac speaking of which i am now switching to goodbye windows after years of struggling with your crappy software i m done

1,great gps unit that does what is supposed to do and flawlessly at that clear easy to read display and instructions menus and interface are self intuitive to the degree that you just turn it on and start using it no downloads activations or learning required satellite acquisition takes just a few seconds and recalculation when you miss a turn or instruction is equally fast accuracy is impressive with spot on instructions and updated maps even small streets in rural areas are recognized and labeled after looking at the garmin and magellan units i thought this was the best unit for the price it has the largest screen and the most features for this price range a previous reviewer complained about the misrepresentation of bluetooth capabilities to which i completely disagree the fact the bluetooth features are available at this price range is already impressive also unless you buy a much pricier unit none of them come with a dashboard stand all manufacturers seem to sell them as options garmin included

1,i already have a single jogging stroller not a bob and have been happy with it we are in the process of adopting our second child which we had less than hours notice about so a lot of money is going to legal costs baby stuff and my time off of work and as a result i was concerned about spending this much on a stroller but is was worth every cent with the bob duallie i am ecstatic overjoyed delighted thrilled and looking forward to my next trip out for my first trip out i put my year old and week old in and went for a six mile walk the trip was so smooth both kids slept for most of the time the seats recline enough so that my baby is nearly flat no problems with his head bobbing around pardon the pun the shocks give this stroller an incredibly smooth ride which transits to less work for my arms i didn t realize how much effort went into the other stroller pushing it and turning it the smooth ride also allowed us to walk faster a plus when trying to lose weight the stroller can turn in circles on itself allowing for extremely sharp turns very nice especially when inside a small store like starbucks the windows up top are well placed enough that i can actually see my kid s face not just their little bodies the straps are the easiest to adjust of any stroller i ve used there is extra padding along the shoulder straps to cushion the kid s shoulders the straps at the waist don t come out of the sides this is kinda hard to explain the strap is attached in the center of the seat and the sides come around the child more like a belt and allowing for a snugger fit even my year old mother had a great time pushing the stroller as for the mesa orange it is more like a burnt orange with brown trim and i am very glad i got it it is not at all like the neon orange it appears in some of the photos be sure to get the tray i forgot to order it with the stroller the storage is a little shallow but being double wide there is still plenty of room for stuff

0,i also had the heater on mine go out after a few short months i really loved this machine though it actually blew air and it has the nice safe switches unlike the toggles that most have now i had one of those previously and my cats turned it on while i was gone and almost burned the place down so anyway i m trying to contact the manufacturer but i doubt it will do any good too bad loved it while it worked hoped it was a fluke and was going to order another before i saw the reviews
1,when this first was released i really wasn t expecting much the last two releases mega dave put out risk and the world needs a hero excluding the live rude awakening while certainly had some moments were out of material but in defense they had to do what they to do to stay around however this album from the up tempo blackmail the universe kick the chair which could have been on rust in peace the scorpion another return to form and back in the day definitely were a few of the many highlights of this album i wouldn t put this up there with rust in peace or countdown but i certainly would put this up there with so far so good or youthansia actually this album kind of takes elements from those albums and put s it into one if your a new fan and just getting into megadeth this isn t a bad place to start certainly a must have and am looking forward to the brand new album next year long live mega dave
0,first off the knife is great i wouldn t expect anything less from swiss army only bad part about the knife is that the altimeter has an accuracy error margin of about and since this is both the title of the knife and the main feature of it i give the knife a two only because you can get a knife just like it without the altimeter that works just as well
0,i ordered this item with the hope of finding a new home for my ever growing collection of credit cards grocery store cards insurance cards club cards hotel cards airline cards you get the point i was disappointed to discover that placing more than one card in the wallet prevents the accardion from collapsing enough to zip close i can t imagine how such a defective design would ever have made it to market unless you want a really large leather case for a single credit card i would not recommend this product
1,this product was delivered fast it was so easy to install and the light is a pretty blue just like the picture when the light is on it does not show up as well
0,i received my order of three oils jasmine ambergris and musk their fragrance was so obscured by the oil medium that you cut the essential oil with that they all smelled very close to the same i have caswellmassey oils from years ago and they are still true to their fragrance and it is true one drop will last all day and often linger for more have they sold out or sold their name i only ordered three oils because somewhere i read if you order dollars or more from you the shipping was free this was not the case i was charged for shipping these products i received are a joke the caswellmassey name is no longer associated with an exemplary product i am sure the original caswellmassey folks are turning over in their graves every time you send this jokeoil to an unsuspecting customer shame on you shame on you all
1,supposedly this is the safest artificial sweetener and it tastes fine too favorite uses coffee tea and hot cereals such as oat bran and unsweetened oatmeal i ordered two of these gegunda boxes and am grateful for the opportunity to save so much money vs supermarket prices unfortunately there was a terrible delay i ordered on feb and didn t receive until march otherwise no complaints and i m fixed for sweetener for a good year

1,i purchased this grill for my husband four years ago and we are still very happy with it it has held up very well when we were having problems with it lighting the back burner i called customer service and they were extremely helpful they saved me buying a whole new burner set by explaining to me how to remove the tubes check and clean them we are now replacing the racks and flavorizer bars since they are just too hard to clean after all this time i have found replacement parts at home depot and lowes which is a plus to know i can easily get the parts i don t see us haveing to buy a new grill anytime in the near future
0,i purchased this item and one month later i still have not received any paperwork i emailed and have not received a reply
0,a major concept of an atomic clock to me meant i would not have to reset it for dst other clocks in my home took care of it i waited two weeks and this clock did not i can t trust if for the true time so i am sorry i purchased it
1,powerbars were created out of necesity to be efficient not to taste like a gourmet treat similar alot of other bars that have since come out if you want something that has a food like texture and tastes like food eat food like a steak a piece of cake or a banana power bars were made for energy in the s people who eat them now got used to them and now actually like them power bars are practically synonymous with the term energy bar because they are the time honored benchmark try a cliff bar or a snickers if you are looking for something tasty when you get tired of those and long for something more in life try a powerbar
1,i had read a lot of reviews here and elsewhere warning of final cut s massive learning curve and i do believe that helped soften the blow when i first tried this program because there definitely is a learning curve this is far more complex than imovie but the good news is it s not beyond the newbie s reach i m such a newbie with anything video it s pitiful i have only made two or three small movies in imovie and they weren t very sophisticated i mostly just tinkered around but being the fool that i am i decided that i wanted to get final cut express to go along with the new camcorder i had just purchased because i was prepared to have to re learn or struggle at first with final cut i had purchased a book for version of fce which was perfectly suitable armed with my book and limited expectations i set about trying to make a fun little music video using video clips and still pictures amazingly enough i learned how to do the ken burns effect with the pictures make transitions from one clip to the next edit the sound so that one track would predominate for part of the video then fade out for other parts and i was able to fix the video clips zoom in lighten change aspect ratio and then i added titles with livetext all this in the first two days of using final cut sure the little video i made was no award winner but it was actually a servicable fun little project that i wasn t too ashamed to show my friends another thing about fixing the aspect ratio of one of the video clips there was this one clip that seemed resistent to any tweaking or adjusting that i tried with it i had used multiple programs to try to resize it to the correct dimensions but something always went wrong either the picture quality degraded terribly or else the corrected dimensions didn t stick and it bounced back to being distorted nothing worked until final cut i m sure that other programs could have done the same thing but i tried so many and failed so that was another thing that impressed me i know there s a whole lot more to learn about final cut and i certainly don t anticipate that i ll become a master at it but it does offer a lot more flexibility than imovie and it is definitely a lot of fun the right way to approach it is i believe to start small expect baby steps at first have fun and get a book a book is absolutely essential if you are an impatient soul who expects perfection the first day this is not the application for you because you learn to do it manually you have much more control but it takes time to learn it all oh a note about hardware i made my first little video on a ghz mac mini with megs of ram it wasn t a speed demon by any means but because my video was short about minutes it really wasn t too painfully slow most of the time except for rendering but i guess that was going to be slow anyway i have since upgraded the mini to gb of ram and everything is snappier so i highly recommend it but it s good to know that even a little mac mini with less than impressive ram can work in fce
0,we recieved two of these for my daughter s first birthday she loves being in the pool but this float almost changed everything the inner tube sinks underneath the top tube no matter how you try and fix it or blow it up my daughter freaked out she had never been afraid of the water until we put her in this do not waste your money

1,pro great story teriffic acting beautiful setting con some pacing flaws but not enough to destroy the whole lindsay duncan is perfectly cast as the guardian of this endangered photographic archive and liam cunningham is her well cast perfunctory foil as as the story unfolds the differences between british and american style and culture are revealed providing a nice subtext to the plot one of the viewing pleasures is in discovering that not everything is as it appears from the central story to the character s lives good actors all but my best actor award goes to the photographs themselves the stories they tell and the feelings they evoke are haunting and captivating all at once a visually rich film
1,this angel is sure to be a gem in any collectors collection she is elegant and graceful her gown in beautiful as well as her spiral curled hair she is adorned in a golden head chain she has a chain sash which is also part of her gown at last she is given beautiful golden wings and holds a bouquet of flowers this one will definately be worth the value in the years to come
1,i love cheetos did you have any idea you could review cheetos on amazon com i admit i had no idea i typed it as a goof and up the page came but i stand by my star review full of yummy msg do you know how msg works it dilates your taste buds so all the flavors seem more intense it actually has no taste of its own did you know when my mother was pregnant with me she would wake up in the middle of the night and ask my father to go out and buy cheetos i don t know why maybe the salty goodness if cheetos cost as much as truffles they would be a considered a delicacy and served at the finest restaurants i wonder if you can buy truffles on amazon com shall we check see you there

1,i loved this book it talked about every facet of the stock market but didn t go overboard with jargon i knew absolutely nothing about stocks and after reading this book i am ready to learn more it was well written interesting and unlike some investing books the author was not trying to sell anything this is the perfect book for anyone who wants to invest but has no knowledge of the subject i really enjoyed this book
0,bought these beads for my month old he enjoys taking them in and out of the container they are made out of thick plastic but are too heavy to stay snapped together when we snapped or more together they would not stay snapped together because the weight of the beads pulled them apart as soon as they re moved
0,okay were to start this car seat looks good on paper but that is it when it arrived the box was completely smashed and the car seat already had a tear in it if you have the latch system in your car you must find and shove all the belts inside the seat then pull them out the correct places not so easy then in order to attach it to the base you must pull out a metal bar and once the seat is attached slide it back this is very hard so once there together it is a pain to take apart for facing backwards if the seat is not level with your car seats use a towel or blanket you shouldn t have to do that plus with my baby in it his feet are still squished into the rear seat once you turn it forward to get the belts adjusted you press a button on the bottom of the car seat and pull them towards you this would work fine if the base wasn t holding them so you can t move them we took the car seat off the base so we could adjust the belts what is the point of that once it is in your car the way you want it does suit it s purpose but i highly suggest buying something of better quality

1,we love this granola bear naked makes wonderfully nutritious and delicious granola we love eating the banana flavor by the handfuls and the peak protein flavor mixed in with our yogurt amazon sells it for a great price too
0,let me just say that i have thick dry frizzy hair with an oily scalp and this shampoo bar made it an even bigger mess it dried my hair out even more and made it so hard to manage the smell was really good at first very coconuty but then after a few uses it developed a weird scent like playdoh and pepper so i just used up the rest of it as regular soap it has made me somewhat wary of trying other solid shampoo bars
1,this film really shows the versatility of peter sellers and the truly magical nature of his acting this is a light hearted comedy and a treasure to watch the quality of the film is superb even though it is based on a black and white source frankly you forget that it is in black and white format
1,i ve had this trimmer for years and never had a problem sometimes the switch needs to be moved twice but it always works never falls apart and cut hair great i d buy another if this one would ever wear out
0,the joke here is that krugman is convinced he can write he ends his little intro with the smug assertion that maybe economists can write after all offering himself as proof krugman cannot write well but he has mastered the clumsy undistinguished style of a bad lit professor the kind of tenured mediocrity that dominates academic publishing an accomplishment he s very proud of to use his own favorite emphasizing gimmick krugman stinks full stop the punchline is that shortly afterward the new york times hired him it was a match made in middlebrow heaven i should add that i do like the substance of krugman s newspaper articles if not the style an enemy of the current white house is a friend of mine as far as the economics go he s pro nafta and pro free trade just like all establishment economists and completely unwilling to critique the real forces at work in international markets don t waste your time
1,i enjoyed this magazine as a kid but then i also loved electric company looking at both now they seem dated and tedious but perhaps our children need something that moves at a slower pace than everything seems to do now neither of my children enjoyed highlights at first but after getting a subscription from their grandmother they have discovered the joy of curling up in a quiet corner and figuring out the puzzles and stories for themselves it s a magazine with a style and format that encourages reflection and absorption rather than a voracious grab and go version of reading that i believe will give a child a better foundation to read without reflection is like eating without digesting edmund burk
0,the only good thing i can really say about this seat is that it comes in pink it s hard to find carseats that are not really ugly otherwise i cannot take my newborn out without help because this seat does not recline far enough back and her head flops forward i will be returning to work in a couple of weeks and will be bringing her with me i m a nanny i don t know how we are going to do it and may have to purchase a new seat already i would think that if something is deemed an infant carseat it should work correctly and safely from birth not from when the baby can hold their head up
1,unlike many of my friends this was not a traumatic time for me however it took quite some time before i could read anything about the era now that it is so long ago that it is sort of a dream i wonder if i should have kept up with this magazine i now find it intriguing and wish there was more on the area i was in the major players are displayed but not so much the more personal information yet i have friends that were in many of the groups depicted in this magazine and it like any other specialty magazine of a time and place can hold special moments for them there is also a good magazine for people that missed their chance to take place in vietnam in that time in history as with any experience if you ere not there then you can not know but this comes closest to an objective telling of history be sure not to overlook the ads as they are an intricate part of the magazine and offer some interesting items th cavalry armed recon
0,i have been working with this camera for about a year now for product shots online and while sometimes it takes great pics many times the flash pops and whites out or it goes off and you get a black picture i take pictures of jewelry and if i try to shoot a piece with green and blue coloration the color is not accurate purple is another color this camera does not accurately pic up while you can fiddle with different picture taking settings in all different modes you ll never get the same picture twice even saving the setting the light has to be just so to get a good shot when it shoots clearly it can take fabulous pictures but often pics are blurred as many others have said when they actually come out my old camera the dsc megapixel is much better colors are accurate always shooting is flawless and foolproof every time and the greatest feature is re sizing your picture and trimming right on the camera before uploading this feature is completely missing from the dsc which was the biggest disappointment as i figured it would be a given i didn t have to ask about when purchasing why would sony eliminate this great function had i know that when the salesman at the large new york city photo store told me this was the camera i dreamed of i would not have bought it i prefer also to use the rechargable aa batteries instead of the lithium battery which is super hard to load and charging this camera is a nightmare with the charger it comes with it is like a puzzle trying to get the charger inserted at just the right angle every time it takes me several minutes and finding a good little wall charger for it is also a problem i recently took this camera on vacation to take pics and get footage for burning to dvd sound quality is good but video quality can be choppy and the monitor did not let me even see that my setting was overexposed so all my footage is somewhat overexposed for the entire trips shootings i made the monitor while big does not show you always what you are shooting whether a still or movie picture overall i would not recommend this camera and i actually bought a used second of my old camera and got my original repaired because this one doesn t compare this camera is a bit too complicated and not very user friendly even after using all this time i still am not sure what i am going to get when i use this camera i d say the worst features to be aware of are for someone who needs accurate color this camera clearly has trouble showing blue green shades and purples accurately you can never show these colors are they are in life with this camera and the lack of the trimming resizing feature what was sony thinking next time i am trying something other than sony cybershot unless i hear they have gone back to making a great straightforward uncomplicated easy to point and shoot camera this one is definitely not
1,very nice sandal lookes great with a dress or jeans low enough to wear for hours at a time but high enough heel to make it look chic
0,this is the first product i ve bought through amazon that i wish i could give a negative star rating after involving three adults and spending about hours troubleshooting i ve concluded this product does not work customer service cites this is a product upgrade a video shows cable wrapping around pole and unleashing with sufficient velocity to hit what we received was a cable of similar rigidity to what you would lock your bike up with or tow a small vehicle it would barely even unwrap imagine derek jeter in the photo trying to hit the ball three inches from the pole at miles per hour and you can begin to understand this product upgrade
0,i bought this phone based on a review in wired magazine i love their reviews usually but this one really let me down i read another customer s review i forget where saying they had sound quality problems but i thought yeah right one in a million well i bought the phone and had the exact same experience very poor sound voice quality it sounded worse than a cell phone in an underground wind tunnel i cannot imagine why i charged the battery for hrs i had it on a separate circuit and it had it s own line i plugged in an old ge ghz phone an whamo no troubles what so ever needless to say i took the phone back and bought a cheap desk phone with a cord sometimes you don t get what you pay for
0,i really don t want to be mean but i find this album very shallow classical indian music is a very complex subtle and beautiful thing comibining it in this way may help to get these wonderful tabla players to a wider audience but the true energy has been tainted and lowered to make it palatable to simple minded people who need westernized electronic and wishy washy world music cliches i don t find this music to be uplifting or enlightening or interesting and this is not coming from a strict old fundamentalist of anything i have delved deep into the avante guard minimalism new music eastern and western music theory microtonal etc i would recomend jsut being a non westernized album and getting the full benefit of tabla playing however if your mainstay is jungle drum bass then this would be a step up for you so go for it it is worth the pruchase in that case
1,the product work perfectly and the displays are very good beaufiful and modern design
1,it s a good watch i m happy with it it does the job the altimeter is not that accurate but that s the case with almost all the barometric altimeters if u don t mind putting in the correct altitude once in an wile is ok the rest is a o k
1,i ve had this pc remove for year and i have used it everyday that i am home and i have not yet changed the remote batteries my pc has suddenly become more entertaining and useful with this remote the time i spend sitting in front of the monitor is reduced in my sq ft apt the farthest point away from my pc is about ft the remote has always worked from anywhere in the apt thru walls i was surprised to get this much range i have not yet found a spot from which it doesn t work to get the best range be sure to position the usb rf receiver near the computer as directed with my pc i m always playing music i also play digital video files that were either taken with my camera or were rented digitally from the internet i have a good graphics card with s video tv out i got a ft s video out cable this connects my pc and tv which are in different rooms with this remote i now can play and control my entire digital music collection on my home stereo which is connected to the tv without being at my pc or be in the same room as my pc also with this remote any video that can be played on my pc online streaming or local i can watch and control it pause rewind slow motion next fwd on my tv my pc tv has effectively become a powerful media center media center pc not needed there is so much more with the remote i use the mouse from far away lying in bed or on the couch there a numerous ways to get creative with this i wish the remote was lighted still the keys are arranged for touch typing so to speak another negative i ve noticed that windows media player sometimes crashes when video is launched from within the software that comes with the remote
0,where macworld is bad addict is dreadful it is dumbed down to the level of teen beat and the reviews don t deserve the name the extent to which it drools over apple is embarassing leaving no pretence of independence like its competitor it exploits the crummy support that typifies the computer industry so we get articles about the secrets of such and such product a secret in the computer industry is a feature or defect that has not been properly documented by the manufacturer this should be blasted not applauded but addict is happy to exploit readers by selling them the information they should have gotten when they purchased the product
0,although they claim that this item can be used by adults it is the furthest thing from the truth you can only fill the black bottom half up with water which you wouldn t know until you buy it due to this you can t do any combonations with this bag as you knock on its side with even the most mild of punches also after a few hits it rips open like your fists were made of nails even with gloves on the only reason why this purchase was made was due to the fact that i have no where to hang my actual heavybag in my apartment this is not even remotely a replacment for a real bag save your twenty five dollars for something else
0,i love to read great books like brave new world by aldous huxley or far from the madding crowd by thomas hardy i love the aeneid by virgil the odyssey by homer i read both long versions of les miserables and the hunchback of norte dame by victor hugo i read the rise and fall of the roman empire by gibbons and gained much knowledge from doing so i love to read but great expectations was a great disappointment i was somewhat amused until chapter ten where i felt the book became psycho babble i was also disappointed in tale of two cities i could not endure the first two chapters dickens did a fine job on the christmas carol but i will never read another of his books

0,this headset has a major flaw the connections between the headset and phone are full of static the other parties don t hear it but their voice is constantly zapped by the static and i m asking them to repeat themselves i ve compared it with a couple other headsets i ve got and they don t have this problem in the same locations actually this headset has static problems anywhere office car out walking you name it do yourself a favor and avoid this one
1,the overall package is well built and well documented the installation was straightforward and only took about minutes to get up and running it does work but if you are like me most of your tapes are getting pretty old and are not in the greatest of shape sound wise because the software lacks any capabilities to perform sound leveling and noise reduction your resulting that are all over the place sound wise as a cheap work around get the windowsxp plus digital media edition the analog recorder works well enough and is simple to use plus it is only to download you can use it with the plusdeck to play your tapes and provide input and then use the analog recorder to actually record the files and convert to if you get a tape player with a line out you can connect your tape player right to the back of your computer and accomplish the same without the
0,pen doesn t work as fast as i thought it would have very slow to upload text to computer i bought this for a law student and it turns out to be more of a burden to scan and proof the text as you go if you can type at a decent speed i would strongly discurage purchasing this product for note taking
0,i was so excited to buy this stroller it seemed perfect for my yr old daughter the mesh back would be ideal for the hot humid weather it s light and easy to travel with it seemed sturdy most of this was true until i used it for a month honestly the seat is way too big my daughter was forever uncomfortable b c the straps were too loose even at their tightest to hold her and the seat was too deep with minimal padding and no recline she would bump her head on the side frame when riding around and to top it off the frame bent after basic use all we did was take it in and out of the car i was very disappointed maybe this would be a great stroller for a year old but don t buy this stroller b c you re looking for something smaller than your graco but better than an umbrella stroller for your young toddler i think for the price and minimal features it should be of better quality every review mentioned the carrying strap b c that s the only extra feature this stroller was not for us
1,we like this car seat for the price we paid likes love the easily adjustable belts we often let the straps out a lot to get her in it without her being uncomfortable and then tighten it appropriately the point harness is great love that the car seat is compatible with different strollers dislikes it doesn t recline as much as we d like and the head padding is superficial our baby s head tends to fall forward a lot the sun canopy seems like it was designed as an afterthought it certainly works more than adequately but doesn t move easily finally the handle is difficult to move from position to position overall though for the price it s a good seat
1,well look no further my apartment complex doesn t allow any type of charcol or gas grills but electric is allowed i was going crazy trying to find one that would fit my george forman kettle grill i didn t want to lug it in and out all summer so i took a gamble and ordered this grill cover and it fits perfectly i can now leave my george forman kettle grill on my deck and not have to worry about the elements
1,eoghan casey s text is immediately useful it s not theory it s practical it s not biased to one operating system but covers several technologies finally eoghan and the book s contributors do not gloss over today s most offensive topics they address them with vigor and solutions i would share one concern the chapter long product vendor discussion some reviewers label it marketing other reviewers don t mention it at all i ll just forewarn you that you will learn much more about encase or nfr than about their competitors as a security consultant for hewlett packard it seems my bookshelf fills up entirely too easily especially as of the last few years therefore i ve gotten fairly selective with new book purchases until i can get a new bookshelf however casey s text is definitely worth getting worth knocking another book off to make room i hope you enjoy this comprehensive text at least half as much as i do

0,sometimes a reader knows more about a narrow subject than the author when the author is in error about that subject the reader may question the accuracy of the descriptions in the rest of the book such is the case here i ve written books several on parachutes and skydiving i am a pilot skydiver and parachute rigger i know the sport and the industry the author wrote we use flat chutes as parasails what is flat square rectangular ram air a parasail is a kite and is usually under tow behind a boat this sentence does not make any sense four miles up he pulled that would be feet the use of oxygen is not mentioned ferocious out of control spiral one of the cells collapsed the collapse of a single cell will not cause a fast turn and the cell is easily re inflated corkscrewing caused the other cells to collapse not likely guide lines an uncommon reference they are referred to as control lines or toggles he jettisoned the main canopy at feet he freefell ten seconds and opened his reserve at feet the rest of the team on this haho jump would still be at feet five minutes later he would be at about feet he estimated he had about minutes of glide remaining more like eight minutes he was so relaxed he was startled to hear canopies fluttering all around him and the sound of men splashing down just under him how did they all beat him to the landing area they were feet above him fiction writers have a responsibility to make their descriptions accurate when a reader finds obvious discrepancies in one area it makes him or her wonder if the rest of the book is accurate and the writing is not creative dan poynter the parachute manual the skydiver s handbook danpoynter parapublishing com
1,this bike seat is a huge pain to install on a bike it took my husband and i working together about an hour to get it right and there were several points when we thought it wouldn t work we persevered and got it on it is fabulous to ride with our son it is very sturdy our son is very large and rides in it just fine the helmet slides on his head but most helmets are tricky to get just right overall we have been very happy with this purchase
0,grudem seems to have a very distorted and confused vision of christ we can only hope that evangelical become more like christ jesus was the first real liberal and the most radical of liberals if jesus of nazareth was anything he was an extraordinary friend of the down trodden definitely a liberal whose advocacy on their behalf so infuriated the ultra conservative religious and political leaders of his day that they had him killed to prevent the public from hearing the very liberal teaching that you will see quoted abundantly in jesus own words on this web site those who actually know what the bible says about the life and teaching of jesus recognize that far from being like jesus of nazareth today s religious right are much more like the kind of clerics who battled this revolutionary prophet from the day he opened his mouth until the day they had him nailed to a cross although these people claim to represent jesus christ they rarely quote his teaching or follow his example what they do instead is use his name in vain to promote their ideas ideas which jesus himself did not teach and might well have opposed

0,i don t know about you folks but i have small ears though the sound on these ear buds are good i can t keep the darn things in my ear for more than seconds at a time because they re too big for me and forget about trying to walk and keep them in my ears unfortunately this renders them completely unusable and they sit in my drawer of orphaned cords good idea badly designed for size differences
0,this is not i repeat not five stars in all honesty it s more like or stars and i m a big fan of slug atmosphere albums like overcast godlovesugly the felt project and the dynospectrum album is much better than this though the lyrics are thought provoking but slug has been better the production doesn t hold up it s some of the weakest i ve heard from rhymesayers there s only a couple tracks that stand out but i d have to say don t ever f king question that is the best if you wanna hear slug at his best check out the dynospectrum album slug spits classic verse after classic verse

0,i love this minisisc it holds an incredible amount of songs the equivolent of an i pod mini and the ease of use of my minidisc recorder is great but don t buy it here just by having it in my order it jacked up the shipping charge by while everything else in my order would have been shipped free and you can get them at your neighborhood radio shack for the same price as here i got a hi md recorder instead of an i pod and i m glad i did just don t buy the disks from amazon
1,i love this puzzle it is fun and challenging i believe that it is a good puzle for anyone who wants a challenge however i find that there is one problem with it there are no dimensions to tell you how big the puzzle is after you put it togrther i would appreciate it if dimensions were added to the box i am sure that anyone else who purchases this puzzle would appreciate it to so that they know if they are going to have to purchase a puzzle mat as well if they order this puzzle if you like puzzles that are not your everyday puzzle i would recommend that you purchase this puzzle because it would make a worthy addition to any puzzle collection
1,this is an excellent book unlike many other tutorials available on internet it gets you started with some beautiful melodies instead of twinkle twinkle little star highly recommended
1,i ve worked out with cathe for about months now and i have to say this is one of my favorite workouts it combines cardio with upper and lower body in a minute circuit workout the cardio bursts are short but intense expect to jump do power s fast feet shuffles spike lunges etc lower body work well let s just say i hope you like to do leg press since you ll be doing it a lot there are a total of sets of leg press on each leg also cathe inserts some static lunges and squats among other moves she does hover squats with pulses of over the high step your quads will be feeling the burn there arm work includes typical weighted and non weight work such as tricep dips off the high step push ups bicep curls overhead extension etc overall if you re looking for a challenge and a new circuit workout to shock your muscles this is the workout for you beginners beware you can modify certain exercises i use dumbbells instead of a barbell but this is more for the intermediate or advanced exerciser
0,i was so upset after i finished reading this book i wish it wasn t updated and they just kept it in its original version if you are looking for a historical information of how the samurai lived and their values this is the wrong book read bushido the soul of japan the code of the samurai really felt like the code of the japanese business man
0,i just finished the world s largest crossword puzzle last night it s been one heck of a project approximately equivalent to slightly oversized daily crossword puzzles i m going to love hanging the puzzle on my wall it really is something to behold when it s all done but it s also a big undertaking that requires a great deal of patience and perserverance the puzzle itself is moderately difficult but made more so by the fact that somewhere during the revision it s been re done once or perhaps during the original construction some errors were made because of this many of the clues don t match the answers add to that the fact that the author uses many hundreds possibly even thousands of abbreviations that are specific to a certain field e g abbreviation used in electrical engineering that no lay person ever has a chance of knowing and you ve got what can be an exercise in frustration you can work for hours on one small section and only later find out that the clue doesn t fit the answer i m generally pretty dogged in completing crosswords until letter perfect but that s not possible here so i had to sacrifice a bit of my honor and force myself to give up after a couple of passes through the ups and downs still it s about percent solvable which is pretty good when you consider how intricate the puzzle is and how hard it must have been to create overall i enjoyed the process and am pleased with the result if you ve got the time and energy i highly recommend this
1,harper s bazaar is the very best fashion and high style magazine out there nothing compared to the always disappointing vogue better fashions editorials articles that i actually want to read and keepsake editions that are just classics the true bible if you want to be in style
0,i bought a case of these from amazon because someone on some candy forum claimed these were of excellent quality and that they were comparable to premium brands like haribro don t believe it these are cheapo gummi bears no better than whatever cheapo junk your local drugstore supermarket bigbox sells pretty squishy not very chewy and a variety of bland flavors that all taste mostly like sweet there s no point in buying these
1,i have some dry bumpy bits at the top of my arms that have been resistant to any scrubby product i ve ever tried to use but buffy got my skin so smooth amazing and highly recommended soak in the tub shower whatever so the hot water softens up your skin then scrub away the small bar lasts or uses the large is twice as big the small one is more reasonably priced for people who just want to sample the stuff this thing has lots of great little scrubby bits in it ground rice ground almonds and adzuku beans not just one but three and they are all super scrubby you ll be a little red when you re done but it s so worth it once you ve cooled off and your skin is as smooth as a baby s bottom the only downside is that it makes your tub look like somebody dumped sand into the bottom of it once the thing drains the bar melts at around hot water temperature and you re not supposed to use any moisturizer after using this stuff but you really don t have to the moisturizing oils in the bar really do work very well i ll definitely be picking up a couple more of these the cocoa butter lemon lavendar scent is really amazing as well soothing and refreshing it can wake you up in the morning or calm you down at night before you go to sleep definitely try this thing though if you re looking for ultimate exfoliation plus moisturizing
1,i love this product it is easy to use and lots of designs to chosse from
1,this was a gift and i was very pleased with both the quality and extremely fast shipping i will definitely purchased from this seller again
0,please change your name to kid rap when you start producing true rock cd s then and only then you should put rock back into your fake name stop playing both sides i realize that the rap hip hop scene is much easier because over half the fan base is little girls boys and people that dont have a clue what music is all about do yourself a favor and take the rap hip hop out of your so called music one day you will realize that the rap hip hop scene is like a bad smell that real music fans hate and wish would go away
0,my daughter bought this for me so i could see my grand children who live in other states i have spent days and almost trying to get it to work i even hired a computer repairman who charged me and could not get it working if it was not a gift i would send it back to get my money back i called the help line lots of times and usually got someone who didn t speak english very well they would end up telling me it was a problem with the router then i would call the router and they would tell me it is a problem with the d link no one wants to take responsibility for getting it working i even went on the support page on the internet and read pages of things that could be wrong tried them all in six days and i still don t have it working and has cost me alot of time and money good luck if you buy it you will need it

1,i needed a replacement receiver for a fairly modest home theater system i wanted a bare bones system no audio power satellite radio capable etc i only use the receiver as an audio switch and let the tv handle video source selection reviewers of the sherwood rd liked the audio but thought the set up a little confusing being a retired electrical engineer that did not concern me the price was certainly right about the cheapest thing around at i bought the unit and have been completely satisfied i would have given it five stars but heck nobody s perfect i had no problem with the setup procedure and liked the audio quality full disclosure my ears are years old the unit has one optical digital one coax digital and several a v inputs the remote lets you pick video cd tuner and aux inputs you tell the system which audio source to use for each of these one time and it remembers i liked the way the front panel display tells you whether a full surround signal is present i was surprised to find how many premium hd movie channels do not always broadcast in full surround and not always in hd either i also liked the fact that one button on the remote cycles a test tone to all six speakers so you can quickly balance them on the negative side i like other reviewers bemoaned the lack of a switched power outlet since a powered sub woofer is required
1,i ve used version and enjoyed it thoroughly i primarily used it for school with different classes and notes for each what was great is that is consolidates everything in a way that makes it easy to retrieve your notes it also makes it easy to generate reports based on the tagging feature the tags allow you to highlight and gather key points of information that make writing papers a breeze when working with paper this was not always an easy task to take on several weeks ago i downloaded the trial version of onenote the improvements are rather subtle but powerful it didn t take anything to get comfortable with the new features after a short time with the trial version i just purchased it because it was so much fun here are some of the beneficial features like a paper notebook you have sections but with onenote you can have as many sections as you like you can easily link pages to outlook i have linked appointments to a series of notes and support files for various projects and meetings it makes being organized for a meeting a breeze also it s a great way to archive emails in a way that allows you to see them and organize them as you wish you can empty your in box and at the same time keep a record of important emails well worth your time it is also tablet friendly if you use a tablet pc like i do i love it for that use there is a fantastic text recognition feature that works extremely well if you use a tablet this is a great feature as was with the earlier version you can add voice content to your notes that s right voice recorded messages can be added to your notes too cool before you buy you might want to go to the microsoft site and download the trial version you ll be able to assess for yourself i think you ll be pleased i fond it to be one of the best products for electronic file keeping that i ve used for the price it s not a bad deal
1,i love the olay regenerist line moisturizes your skin and makes it smooth you will see a big difference after the first use i ve been using this product for years now and just recently started the serum and it s great

0,i bought this stroller and attempted to use it but one of the wheels kept going flat every morning i had to order another inner tube then on the third day of trying to use this stroller the front wheel completely bent what a piece of garbage i only had one child in the stroller and the wheel was fastened correctly and all i was doing was trying to push the stroller up a small curb the other thing i didn t like about this stroller is that there is nowhere to hang put a diaper bag i sent this stroller back and bought a maclaren double stroller

0,there is not enough space for me to explain why this film and soundtrack are woefully inadequate of the name dr seuss the fact that there are so many songs on the album screams commercialism what the book was complaining about wake up people and james horner s score which has a couple of nice moments but doesn t have that seussian sound where are you christmas is annoying beyond all reason and i mean both versions and whose bright idea was it to have jim carrey mangle you re a mean one if you re looking for a more grinch like score go find elfman s nightmare before christmas

0,i too wasn t very impressed with jarhead i thought half way through that jarhead seemed more like an insider movie for those who actually experienced the marines and perhaps other branches of the military for those of us who haven t i just don t think there was enough direction to keep a lot of us interested as someone else mentione i too thought it was going to be a more modern version of full metal jacket but afte the first few minutes it was obvious it wasn t
1,i would encourage anyone in the market for a shredder to first identify where the machine is to be placed if you want something cute and compact then keep looking this sb is a work horse in every sense of the word consequently it may not appeal to one s feminine traits although the size can be a bit formidable for home use it s power and relatively quiet operation set the standard for all others i was surprised at just how quiet it was the controls are easy to master and the safety features are good to have for the occasional inquisitve child having had a lessor un named shredder i knew that my shredding needs were beyond the waste paper basket sized machines for less money being one who regularly shreds credit card bait checks and other sensitve info that accumulates through the years this sb shredder was a must have i doubt that i ll outgrow this machine i ve had this shredder for only a couple of months now and i expect to have it for many years to come it is necessary to oil the cutters after each full basket though if you are the disciplined and conscientious type this is not a problem however i can see the lifespan of this machine being cut short by the negligent types who don t read instructions
1,alrightly folks it doesn t get any better than this this magazine blends humor with serious reviewing they will give the strong points and bad while keeping it real to the hardcore player elite like me anyhow i ve read this magazine for a while and i ve never been disappointed the ask the lbs gorilla section is a riot the bottomline gamer this is an unbiased not corporatly owned like opm and xbox magazine and a pleasing magazine to read anyone hooked on gaming and looking for great recommendations on must have games should pick up a psm and get a subscription

1,i feel bad doing this becuase i love iggy and the stooges but the quality on this set is pretty bad all the live recordings are worth listening to and probably owning but the quality is very rough and can get frustrating it s like the first beatles anthology set the material is amazing but the quality is bad on the plus side the studio outtakes are decent quality wise and amazing content wise the packaging is also very nice i just though i d share this information before you drop all the money on the set if you are a stooges fan don t hesitate purchase now but if this is your introduction you should probably wait
1,this is a great item but it does have some flaws i got this for my month old and he loved it now he s months and loves it just as much the thing is you need to manually push the button and then you can use the remote after it plays all the music and it shuts off the only way to turn it back on is to press the button yourself not great when you re flying on the freeway but it still seems to calm my baby as soon as the music goes on
1,these are wonderfully crunchy and delicious the calorie count is misleading however one piece is more than the calories they claim it is but it s worth it

1,first off the picture is all wrong the tools are just like the ones in the mr bar b q piece oval stainless handle tool set except you also get the plastic case scraper corn holders and knives not the wooden ones shown in the picture it comes with the xxxl spatula and tongs i mean these thing are huge in every sense of the word its a nice set for the price i would have like a smaller spatula and tongs like the ones shown they are almost too big but i am sure this will last a long time the tools look quite durable good buy but just be aware what you are actually buying
1,i am a lover of greatest hits compact discs but this one by far is the best one i have purchased recently this compact disc has almost all of the best tunes that joe walsh made and i highly recommend it to anyone who loves to rock
0,i love me some mamet his dialogue takes some getting used to since it is crafted so as to touch on the edges of realism while inhabiting a more stylistic realm i also love his dedication to his actors employing the same ones over and over so that his movies come off as different shows performed by the same theatrical troupe which may very well be his point however edmond is the first mamet film to leave me disappointed and worse annoyed macy plays edmond with typical wide eyed aplomb edmond is a man who is weak but is valiantly if not clumsily trying to be strong the movie starts with a chance encounter with a fortune teller whose tarot card reading provides a cinematic outline for the remainder of the film edmond then goes home breaks up with his wife and goes on a deaf dumb and blind search for himself finding instead over priced whores pimps who are not what they seem and generally everything but himself i get the point edmond is the epitome of modern man s emasculation unable to find his own balls with both hands and his tawdry and panicked search through new york for some unnameable salvation is an example of the lengths anyone must go man or woman to find if not redemption then the places where one belongs there are a lot of problems here most superficially there s one of packaging the dvd box prominently features a picture of a gun and no gun appears in the film the tags on the box call the film alternately a mystery and a fast paced thriller when it is neither one of those things not even close this movie is like most of mamet s work based on a play never before has it been more obvious unless you count the absolutely brilliant oleanna edmond is essentially a one man show with macy delivering numbing and rambling monologues stopped only occasionally to engage in awkward and almost meaningless side action with ancillary characters some of them played well denise richards actually shines in her brief scene as a hooker and some of them not so well julia stiles seems over medicated in her role as an ambivalent and easily persuaded waitress in spite of how they do and don t help edmond make his way through the tunnel of decadence and misery he creates for himself most of these characters seem disposable making the movie come across as equally dismissable i would also like to take a moment here to make a small observation about rebecca pidgeon mamet s wife an actress who appears i think in every single one of her husband s films this woman is viewed in even the nicest of lights one of the worst actresses i ve ever seen and she sucks the life out of every scene she s in in this movie she plays edmond s wife and does so with heartless and uninspired vehemence it s nice that mamet gives his wife the opportunities he does but one has to wonder if she d ever get any acting work at all if she weren t married to such a famous writer director at the risk of spoiling the film i will say that at the end edmond finally does find where he belongs a place that given his previous struggles makes a lot of sense although the manner in which he finds this belonging might offend more than a few viewers but this is small consolation since by this time few people are likely to have any sympathy for edmond or where he ends up his character s slap dash personality combined with the persistent and mostly meaningless monologues on fate fear destiny and ironically meaning make for a benumbing and distasteful cinematic experience a few good performances and some nice visceral cinematography do not save this film from its plot and the dialogue that fails to move that plot along avoid this flick try oleanna or glen gary glenross instead
0,i agree with the above comments all one sees is a black cover the book looks sounds interesting but there is no table of contents or example of what is inside the book this book needs to present more information if you expect one to buy

0,please spend your money on a different gate there are nice wooden stair gates out there that seem pricey at first but after going through what we have gone through i wish i would have gotten a different gate we have twin girls in a bi level house a stair gate is a must the day warranty is a joke because naturally each gate broke after days same problem with all four the knob just wont turn i will say when it worked it was nice but read other reviews and you will see the same problem over and over again shame on me for buying it again it just broke this past saturday after six months of use i will contact the manufacturer but as in the past i m sure i won t get anywhere if enough people complain perhaps they will change the design again please look elsewhere
0,i m a fan of audrey hepburn and this movie relys heavily too heavily on her charm and unfortunately it is some of her worst acting work posey sing song and superficial now if you ve read her bio and know what was going on with her and holden that could explain it but still this film is very static like most heburn films a highlight is her clothes her style her self this film self consciously relys on this when the script itself could simply have been better there are some very fun cameos by big performers that raise moments here this film would have benefited greatly by a better comic actress in the lead jayne mansfield could have been a hoot in this thelma ritter too in a very different way somebody with less style and more off beat snap crackle and pop thelma ritter and william holden paired in a romantic comedy i m all ready laughing before i hit this too harshly this film was intended to be a trifle the kind of movie that has bright colors and light plot for a hot summer day that sizzles for that it is adequate the remake alex and emma suffers very much from the same problems they actually improved the script and gave the leading lady room to make some very wacky choices but both films seem to have suffered from settling for a star when a less mainstream more zany actress was needed ok this doesn t stink it has audrey but it certainly doesn t sizzle
1,i bought this for my grandson and he no sooner got it out of the box with help and he was outside in the sand with it having a great time cannot lose with these oversized trucks for little hands it is a good purchase
0,well unless you are a hardcore collector like myself had it originally on vinyl all those years ago stay clear of this album if you want to hear noise that you your wife girlfriend boyfriend could do yourself then forget this album make your own noise the best track on the album is the bonus track that tells you that this album has nothing to do with beatles music i give it one star for being terrible one star for the packaging search judemac forever on msn
1,this sauce is medium heat for everyday use it has an excellent roasted pepper flavor and there is no vinegar to get in the way consequently you get exactly what one should expect from a pepper sauce versatility and flavor that does not try to smother the character of the food you season with it an every day sauce should not leave a patina on your tongue this is not a boutique novelty it s a household staple the oz size is the right size for a hot sauce household you want good try tapatio on cottage cheese you ll never eat cottage cheese any other way again i promise i use it on just about anything except cereal and ice cream but my personal favorite applications of tapatio are eggs potatoes pizza anything creole forget tabasco cottage cheese most rice mac cheese and of course mex in my opinion this is the best sauce in your local grocery store
0,the pictures get jammed in the camera and are very hard to remove one picture got stuck in there and so this toy was broken after about days of play
0,i ordered this gun because it was such a great deal when it arrived i took it out of the box and the barrel was cracked a big crack nothing a little gorrila glue can t fix though also the accuracy isn t consistent it is always about or inches off from about feet i had to put the back part of the laser off the sliding mechanism to get it to be accurate otherwise it was feet high the pellet also starts to curve after feet or so too so this gun was a good deal but isn t the best quality gun i ve had you have to load it from the top of the gun which means taking off the laser putting in the bbs and putting on the laser again the magazine doesn t even come off it still has decent speed and isn t crap it s just bad it was worth bucks though
0,i read some raving reviews about this book but i admit i was quite disappointed factual i m sure but it lacks details and tries to touch on too much without going into any depth many other pregnancy books go into further detail

1,kevin spacey i ll write it again kevin spacey whether he s playing keiser soze a pyschopath in seven or an alien in k pax any film he touches seems to sizzle swimming with sharks is no exception in fact we get to see kevin in a role that resembles the one he portrayed in glengary glen ross only magnified thirty of forty levels on the pompousity chart frank whaley plays his underling in the corporate world you might remember him as the victim of samuel l jacksons rant in pulp fiction right before he gets his head blown off or as the young kid from field of dreams playing a young burt lancaster well as goofy as it might sound whaley does a wonderful job in swimming with sharks you emphathize with his character even when he turns from naive victim to unflinching nut case at the end as for premise kevin spacey plays a corporate boss who is showing his yes man played by whaley the tricks to moving ahead in the mean time however he does everything he can to make his employee s life a living hell thus driving the young worker into the last segment of this film is the most amazing i loved the twist many i imagine will not the film quickly moves from humor to dark drama in a matter of minutes and the twist may upset many especially spacey s delivery in the last clutch scenes this movie is basically the director s rant and rave come to full life it s based on his own experience in the corporate world and be warned untold buckets of foul language await you so be ready

1,this is a must have item if you want to add the clock tower to your set it also works well with the other elevation sets particularly mile high mountain the set includes the following ramps these are made from two shorter pieces that are screwed together curves short straights guard rails end ramps arches supports and crosspiece each the crosspieces of the arches have a picture of how the ends of the track should be aligned the screws are a little tough but never need to be removed the set is enough to run up two full levels and back down again my son has played with this set just by itself having fun running up around and racing back down you can also make two single level bridges a single level bridge and a ramp down from mile high mountain or many other setups this set literally adds a new dimension to a geotrax set lots of fun the short pieces also allow for different configurations that may have been frustrating in the past definitely fun

1,overall i was pleased with ease of installation this was an upgrade from office i backed up all files before upgrade and always do this but it was not necessary for this upgrade my overall disappointment is outlook s inability or difficulty to use other mail servers yahoo gmail etc the shift appears to favor msn products only hotmail and msn no wonder thunderbird is slowly becoming a favored email application
0,based on other reviews here and comparisons to jellyfish jason falkner and the beatles i was expecting a lot better instead i find this work very shrill and hard to listen to is the guy talented musically yes but his voice is mediocre and his songs really don t do it for me sorry but i feel the need to give an honest assessment so others won t be mislead by the breathless reviews here i am a big fan of power pop and all good music but this does not rank with the best of that genre
0,i have had this smoker since august and have a total of hours smoking on it i noticed that the thermosat was starting to burn out after hours of use and by hour it was gone rendering the smoker useless the other problem i have is that the porcelain coating inside the cooking chamber has all pealed off leaving bare metal exposed dealing with charbroil to get it repaired or replaced is useless at the start it was a nice easy to use smoker but with the problems encountered i would pass for something better
0,maiden voyage appears on innumerable lists of jazz masterpieces and it is clear from the first listen that both the composition and the playing are at a level of technical proficiency unmatched on most albums of this era or any time afterward nevertheless the finished product is not one that all listeners will find appealing to these ears this album seems aimless and even somewhat annoying the songs meander without clear structure and tony williams drumming seems at times to be going in a direction opposite that of the rest of the band the influence of this album is indisputable but its enjoyability is a more subjective matter if you enjoy groundbreaking cerebral jazz such as the music made by miles davis second quintet then this album will probably work for you if on the other hand you favor hancock s earlier and more accessible albums takin off and my point of view this album may be a bit of a letdown
0,this backpack was very uncomfortable the inserts are stiff it doesn t represent canon quality i hope
0,of people found the following review helpful everlife is littlelight november reviewer agnazzo tampa florida united states see all my reviews living in florida i bought two of these everlife flashlights the party that said that these flashlights are charged up during shipping is suffering from shaking of the head it takes at least a minute of shaking after delivery before the flashlight is giving out its maximum amount of light which is very low after that to keep it operating more shaking is in order the illumination which is very low compared to other battery flashights dies out very rapidly and need additional shaking to keep it going this flashlihgt to be fair may come in handy during a hurricane power failure led flashlights that use batteries are far superior to these shaking flashlights the batteries last a very long time due to the low power that leds operate at

1,this book is a very good study into what happen to the lost ten tribes of israel mr capt did a great job in back tracking by using the clay tablets that were found in assyria which list the tribes by the name which was used by the assyrians which is called the house of omri this book is very in depth and very informative i also noticed a person left one star because mr capt did say anything about the jews of course the jew s wouldn t be metioned they weren t taken into exile until bce and that was by babylonia and not assyria when reading about the ten tribes people need to know that the ten tribes were not jews over all i give five stars and it is a must have for a historian or an avid bible reader intrested in research
1,this movie is based on the story the adventure of the dying detective written by sir arthur conan doyle to adelaide savage susan harker consults sherlock holmes jeremy brett about what she can do about her husband s cousin culverton smith john hyde who seems to be having a negative effect on her husband victor savage richard bonneville sherlock dismisses this as not in his field of expertise until adelaide s husband dies from a parasitic fever coincidentally her husband s cousin is an expert in such diseases even more coincidental the majority of victor s estate will go to his cousin leaving his wife with very little at this point sherlock becomes interested he even publicly states to smith that these coincidences are not within the realm of probability thus implying that smith is a murderer but how is he to prove this unfortunately sherlock comes down with the same disease that victor died from and the only person that can help him is smith as dr watson edward hardwicke attests brett as usual does a good job in capturing the essence of the famous gumshoe in his performance also john hyde as culverton smith gives a fine performance i had a friend who knew nothing about brett s health problems watch this movie she could not see anything abnormal about him and in fact commented on his excellent performance i also felt his performance was excellent finally the props costumes background music and cinematography are well done in conclusion this is a good movie to watch even if you have read the story it s based on min british drama made for tv full screen colour

0,i know of many people who would love to have an elk carcass for their holiday birthdays christmas hanukkah martin luther king jr s birthday observed grandparent s day etc are all holidays where a big piece of elk meat could brighten someone s day but watch out i have often used amazon in order to buy gifts and with this elk carcass gift wrapping is not an option i would think that half the fun of giving a huge elk carcass would be watching the look on your loved one s face as he or she unwrapped the slab of meat unfortunately amazon does not think this is so with the weight of the product i think it is going to be difficult to wrap this on my own sorry uncle tino no elk carcass for columbus day this year
0,this doesn t even deserve star this supposed relaxation gadget was a complete waste of time and money it had no heat as advertised and the vibration just left my ears itching instead of relaxing it has increased my stress level
1,i give this book a star rating not because i believe in the necronomicon but because this particular book has given some very interesting background and historical information on the occult scene in the the simon necronomicon itself is an interesting tome though i doubt it s authenticity per se it is at least as valid a grimoire as any other and more valid than some dead names has provided a great deal of information on certain people whose backgrounds are generally not known as well as the unique wandering bishop phenomena and the so called slavonic orthodox church overall both an informative and entertaining volume whether you believe or not
1,i received the xacti a few weeks ago and it s performing like i hoped it would the controls are a very simple and intuitive all the required hardware is included does not require any additional software to run on mac or windows i have a macbook with boot camp running windows xp pro the camera works easily with either platform it is recognized as another drive and does not require any additional software to download the images and movies onto the hardrive i am using a sandisk sd memory card another big plus is not having to wait while downloading real time like you would have to with minidv the quality may not be the same as minidv but the convenience and ease of use make up for the difference the quality is much better than a digital camera when taking movies and people will think it s just a camera by it s small size my old camera was a mega pixel canon powershot this is rated at mega pixel you can definitely see the difference in the pictures and movies when filming movies the higher frames per second sample rate makes the images smooth even when taking pictures of high speed objects like helicopter rotor blades and airplane propellers this is my first camcorder so i can t really compare to anything else except my old camera but the ease of use will make you want to use it all the time and people will start to tell you to put that thing away
1,ahh the tekken series probably the most influential series of fighting games outside of the virtua fighter games tekken is a welcome return to form for this true master of the genre with the game just a distance memory this takes the series forward or back depending on how you look at things tekken uses the tried and trusted tekken gameplay while still making everything feel fresh characters that once before were just mere clones of certain main ones are now fully fleshed out with moves of their own anna williams for example is now not a clone of her sister nina when people mention tekken they usually think of people who have mastered every single command and move while spending hours upon hours practising to hone their mad skillz as it were making the game unplayable for beginners to the genre this i think is far from the truth tekken welcomes new and veterans to the series alike whereas button bashing pretenders to tekken s crown coughdeadoralivecough leave you feeling somewhat cold tekken on the other hand leaves you feeling a great sense of satisfaction when you play yes tekken has its button bashing characters but every single character is unique and how unique they look arguably the best looking game to date with gorgeous backdrops fluid realistic animation and textures that would look at home on any next gen console music wise it s back to form mix between techno dance we ve come to know and love from tekken the least we say about tekken s music the better you ve got your usual story mode to run through with each character to see why they ve entered the tournament etc but this edition borrows the human ai mode of virtua fighter this has replaced the arcade mode in name and pits you against humans who have uploaded downloaded their data from the tekken arcade machine from all over the world it s a welcome challenge even though it doesn t even compare to facing a real life human opponent all in all this is the true homecoming of a master easily the best tekken to date and probably the best fighter in existence though i am partial to abit of soul calibur heh

1,unless you frequented jazz clubs in baltimore or philly in the fall of this would have been your first exposure to the miles davis john coltrane collaboration a few tracks recorded for columbia the label miles would soon be joining exclusively a few weeks before this session weren t issued until much later davis settled on coltrane as his replacement for the departing sonny rollins almost by default no one else fit the bill or new the book that they would stay together long seemed unlikely because their temperaments differed so much davis was a hands off leader coltrane wanted constant input from miles on his playing and music in general stablemates a benny golson tune is the track that seems to draw the most attention it s an excellent composition and although coltrane sounds somewhat tentative nervous the performance is attractive but my favorite side is there is no greater love even though coltrane sits this one out miles plays beautifully and i love the emotion he wrings from the tune true this is an early effort by the group that would transform modern jazz but it s a very good session nonetheless the group plays well the rhythm section is rock solid and they are all off and running full speed ahead

0,i used my remote all of about times before it stopped working even with the proprietary dongle inserted into a controller slot you cannot control this thing with a controller you must use the remote control when you take the dongle out with a dvd in a screen will come up telling to reinsert so if either the dongle or the remote get slightly injured or malfunction then you ve just wasted thirty bucks i feel quite ripped off with the low cost of dvds nowadays it s a much better idea to buy a standalone imho you can get a good progressive scan for about or which comes out to about the same price as a side it is also extremely annoying that you can t turn on or off the device with the remote you must go up to box to do it yourself especially annoying if you just want to watch a dvd in your bed and crash afterwards all in all the value proposition offered by this product is very low considering the similarly priced alternatives

1,i am not going to go over the contents of the book or much about charles bukowski because if you are considering this book you must know something about the man and his work i will just give you my impression of this collection of work no collection can ever really be complete there are always new things to add new commentary newly discovered works transcripts of records and unpublished letters but this book does an excellent job in its attempt to me charles bukowski will always be one of the greatest american writers of the twentieth century because of the sheer brutality and honesty his work emanates it is funny sad sadistic cruel scathing enlightening and thought provoking everything i like to read this is poetry for people who are disgusted by verse of flowers trees and greek mythology this is raw human emotion and experience smeared out onto paper it is not perfect and it is not trying to be it doesn t always work but there in lies the subtle beauty of bukowski s efforts the guts to try the attempts at honesty clearly blocked by his unwillingness to divulge everything and his cynicism of man this book has one of the most moving amazing and insightful poems or anything else ever written it is called the genius of the crowd if you read that work of art and are not moved nothing will this collection is shocking in its beauty and inspiring by its simplicity enjoy

0,i had to read this book for a political theory class in college after talking with several other members i was happy to find out that i do not have the reading skills of a third grader benhabib goes out of her way to use vocabulary words that most educated people are not familiar with the book is also not organized well in order to really understand this book you will have to read it while taking notes points that could be grouped together for arguments are scattered throughout entire chapters and even the whole book benhabib may have used her vocabulary and lack of organization as tools to hide that the points she makes are not very well argued throughout much of the book benhabib is trying to shoot down the theories of john rawls and other theorists to support her views on migratory rights to be honest i disagree with her views and admit that i might have found her organization and vocabulary more tolerable if i agreed with her still i do not have a problem with her making these claims if she did so logically much of her work is based on telling the reader why other people are wrong and she will use theories she supposedly already disproved in one arguement to justify her later arguments for disagreeing with other theories in short i do not think anyone would want to read this book for pleasure or intellectual curiosity if you have to read the rights of others for a class i extend my condolences

0,i purchased this for my wife for valentine s day the installation went fine but i have two problems with the device first the software to do the picture transfers is awful you can only select pictures on your computer to download you can t see what photos are on the device in the software in order to delete photos you have to do it manually from the device itself i checked the webpage for updated software no joy the crop feature is nice and well used but otherwise i feel like i am looking at a windows application second the image quality on the device is very poor i didn t have very high expectations but this was lower than i expected reminds me of the picture screen quality in the very first color cell phone screens maybe a bit worse you can make out the picture but not much detail at all the advice of cropping the photos to only show headshots is an excellent idea it s the only way to get a decent picture overall i m a little disapointed but then you get what you pay for
1,i bought this coffee pot for home use in utter disgust with drip coffee makers having had three different drip coffee makers stop working in one year i decided to go with something tried and true and while you can t set it up to turn on by itself i will never have to replace it again the color is beautiful it is a snap to clean up just throw it in the dishwasher and the coffee tastes so much better i now use less than half the amount of coffee grounds needed by a drip maker and am getting more flavorful robust coffee and no bitterness i guess this is one thing that modern technology can t top i will never go back to and electric coffee maker
1,though i oftentimes disagree with some of the articles written by the new republic i cannot help but keep coming back to this magazine when trying to gain better insight into current affairs if for anything else the quality of the writing in this magazine is amazing and its reporters obviously conduct painstaking research in writing every nuianced article the group that writes for tnr are obviously some of the best journalistic writers around and its critique on intellecual matters and popular culture are itself enough reason to purchase a subscription to this magazine if you don t like its politics all in all this is a fine magazine

0,i am glad i purchased my cardscan but there are some significant unfortunate missed opportunities and because of that some important functions cannot be done at all my impression is that this is the best product on the market due to its scanning properties which are quite good there are some serious deficiencies though in the rest of the software which would be nice to have fixed and which in some cases render the device somewhat useless since the output cannot be transferred to a useful place pros it does a pretty good job of scanning the algorithm is well developed and is actually quite impressive even cards that catch and rotate as they go through producing a funny smeared image have some of their contents scanned correctly the superiority of this recognition software is the strong point of this product there is also an ok database management product that one can use to maintain and look up cards operationally the product is especially nice i can just sit there feeding cards in and typing carriage return after each one glancing at the screen to catch errors the card image is retained in the record in the cardscan database which is important cons the exit path has places that cards can hang up and they can catch as they go through this happens fairly often unless the card is new and flat so part of the operation is to try to prevent that by straightening out bent corners ahead of time and by adding a little force keep the card from catching and rotating as one corner goes forward and the other is stuck quite needless if the exit path was smooth and continuous this wouldn t happen the problem is in the rear of the plastic case although the product retains the image of the business card there s no way to pass that through to outlook or export it to any other format this is very unfortunate i could laboriously do that by hand by cutting and pasting each one except that cardscan software does not permit copy paste functions on the image why not it s easy to implement every time i start the program it harasses me about registering even though i ve been specific that i do not wish to it also harasses me about logging in the online backup facility even though i ve asked it not to do that it therefore ignores the user wishes the data exchange function allows only extremely crude export to a file in a simple text or csv format there is no way to create an outlook format pst file which would simplify importing and allow for the future option of including an image outlook can hold an image in the comment section of the record but apparently cardscan folks aren t even close to thinking about this if i indicate that a data export for a file is destined for outlook the field names are not set up correctly so unless i do some heavy editing of field names nothing much other than the contact name gets across if i export directly to the running outlook program it isn t perfect but it s close enough to be usable why did cardscan get one right and not the other in neither case can i send the card image over i was forced to install microsoft net software even though i intended to do all my exports via files i didn t get a choice if i didn t install net the installer stopped and exited without installing any cardscan software
0,in terms of both format and style rent despite its superficially modernist tendencies has its roots firmly planted in the grand old operatic tradition yet it suffers from the weakness common to most modern musicals in which the characters sing virtually nonstop throughout the entire production which is that it makes it hard for the audience to connect with the characters in more traditional musicals the long stretches of spoken exposition between song and dance sequences serve as an opportunity for the audience to get to know the characters as recognizable flesh and blood human beings this is less of a problem with a florid romantic fantasy like phantom of the opera which seems a natural for this type of approach but with material like rent which is small in scale and intimate in scope the constant singing serves as a distancing device for the audience i know that this play and perhaps now even the movie has generated a passionately loyal fan base who considers rent practically sacrosanct and therefore beyond criticism but to someone like myself coming cold to the work rent adds up to much less than the sum of its parts the story a modern day update of la boheme set in greenwich village starts on christmas eve and ends on christmas eve this was at the height of the aids epidemic and indeed many of the film s characters primarily gay men and former junkies are struggling with the disease aids being the modern equivalent of the consumption used in the original story there s also a wheezy subplot involving a real estate company that wants to evict the starving artists one is tempted to call them deadbeats from a building in order to further their diabolical scheme of re developing a city block rent with its noble performance artists doing battle against the big bad corporate bullies feels less like a relic from the s than one from the s though intended to be the heroes of the piece the artists and bohemians often come across as painfully self absorbed and annoyingly self righteous an attitude epitomized by one of the characters rigging a local atm machine so that his buddies can withdraw unlimited amounts of money from it using his dead boyfriend s name the heavily allegorical angel as the password this is somehow supposed to be seen as admirable and a tribute to the spirit of the dead man anything s better than actually working i suppose and becoming a tool of corporate america when one of the men finally takes a dreaded job a mere sinecure i might add so that he can actually pay the rent he owes horrors he acts as if he is selling his soul to satan and has to have two of his lady friends accompany him to the interview for moral support and to offer him assurances that he will still be able to live with himself even after he has soiled his hands with the dirty mammon from an honest to god paycheck i wonder why it never occurs to any of these characters that the capitalist system they loathe so deeply is also helping to produce drugs that will one day lead to a possible cure for the disease that afflicts them with the exception of newcomer rosario dawson the filmmakers have retained most of the original broadway cast members for the movie and even though their acting isn t all that impressive some of them do very well indeed at singing and dancing in his direction chris columbus has broken away from the confines of the original production but he never manages to bring us into the world of the people we re watching despite the constantly tracking sometimes even spinning camera he has chosen to employ the film still feels stagy over stylized and artificial in almost every scene as to the libretto by the late jonathon larsen only one tune strikes me as truly memorable while the rest all sound like repetitive musical doodling one of the problems too with having so much of the conversation sung rather than spoken is that the lines are sometimes so utilitarian pedestrian and prosaic when they aren t pseudo intellectual drivel on the order of the opposite of war isn t peace it s creation that they become unintentionally funny when set to music it s not for nothing that the sharks and the jets didn t actually sing out most of their confrontations there are admittedly some very moving passages in the last half hour of the film as the disease finally begins taking its grim toll on several of the characters but those moments of quality are completely undercut by one of the silliest copout endings i have ever seen in a motion picture in that one crucial moment the movie descends to the level of low comedy and farce taking any pretensions to seriousness right down the drain with it i don t question for a moment the basic humanity and sincerity of the people responsible for rent or of its many devoted followers but it s hard to get too worked up over a story whose premise seems to be that people especially sensitive artists should be allowed to live on other people s properties for free
0,i suscribed to this magazine since i got a great offer on it from the company i get my other suscriptions from so i decided why not its been a year and although the previews of each week s prime time programs are fun pages worth i was very dissapointed the articles are empty boring and some downright retarded rehashing show s dialogues requoteing newscomments its a mistery to me how this magazine is still around i realize this is an entertainment magazine but still the articles in people magazine seem like rocket science in comparison gasp do yourself a favor and just buy a tv guide much more interestin
0,grainy iso pictures at any light conditions usage of and low sharpness options partially solves the problem but if you take pictures with panasonic dmc and compare it will be clear that a garbage trash is the right place for this camera i had panasonic dmc and the only cons is really noisy high iso sensitivity mode in camera panasonic implemented the venus iii processor has venus ii processor as a result picture quality really improved at high iso sensitivity modes but dramatically changed for the worse in iso mode

1,the brood is the lightning in the bottle that director david cronenberg has never been able to duplicate while all of his films definitely have his fingerprints all over them the brood managed to rise to the top of all of his films it is absolutely dripping in a sense of dispair and dread there is a pervading coldness about it such that you want to wrap up in something warm as you watch it you want to watch it with the lights on because you re very much afraid of what might be there if you turn off the lights the film is a psychological thriller wrapped in a slasher flick it warrants slasher status simply because of the sheer number of onscreen murders that take place this is a very bloody film samantha eggar is nuts and in a weird clinic for people like her she is being treated by a creepy oliver reed in one of his better performances art hindle is her ex husband and he s worried about how she is treating their young daughter after a while that is the least of his worries as these horribly disfigured and what the hell are they bizarre little children run around killing all the people that have really ticked off samantha eggar i won t say more because part of the horror in a cronenberg film is the pseudo science that he get you to believe in whereas cronenberg s videodrome was weird but not terribly good the brood is one of the creepiest films i ve ever seen and a guilty pleasure can i really call it that that i choose to subject myself to every so often really what are those things
0,this book is not about india or indians shallow characters non existant plot a dismal end to a not terrible beginning unlike one of the other reviewers i was unlucky enough to buy this book what a waste

1,i ve tried several of the annie chun flavors and i liked most of them but the kimchi soup is just unbelievably delicious this is the best packaged soup product of any kind that i have ever tried and i usually dislike canned or packaged soup products this is even better than my favorite canned brunswick stew that i have loved for so long it is moderately spicy but if you don t mind a bit if spice this one is just too good to pass up i could practically live off of this stuff thank you annie chun for making a packaged meal worth eating

0,noam chomsky has thrived greatly in this great country of his yours and mine the united states of america he has made millions of dollars teaching lecturing selling his books and investing his world wide fame in psycholinguistics is well deserved his infamy is merited for his lack of loyalty to his own jewish ethnicity and the u s in spite of the fruits he has received by being a citizen of the united states he has repaid this country in bile with his incredibly biased analysis of american foreign policy he goes way beyond a balanced multiculturism when he always ranks the u s and israel as foremost among the terrorist forces in the world now and even in history his distrust of any authority benign or otherwise is reflected in his dogmatic and unexamined support of the underdog even if that underdog is a suicide bomber or a major terrorist organization such as al queda or hezbollah yet since hypocrite chomsky has worked for the overdog massachusetts institute of technology which has actively and enthusiastically participated in the development of weapons of war and mass destruction and continues to this very day chomsky trumps his own potential for gifted analytic objectivity with his simple hatred of the united states and the jewish state if he were not so attached to the freedom of making money earning the adulation of the american left and freedom to express himself he might be able to give more direct and personal support for our enemies and his friends by taking up residence in north korea iran or syria let us hope he retires outside of our homeland that he hates so much the united states of america god bless america which will continue to give chomsky the right to speak teach and make lots of money raybo

1,i ve been consistently impressed by the bionicle toys from lego and the rahkshi are no exception wish i was young enough to actually play with this stuff sigh anyway rahkshi take the bionicle can sold figures to new a new level of articulation in total joints are found at the neck shoulder wrist hip knee and ankle and the crank on the back swivels the entire arm assembly from side to side so you can whack things with the staff like weapon each of the rahkshi weilds then there s the opening case on the back so you can flip spooky little rubber leech slug things through the air each one of these things appears to come with a miniature cd full of quicktime promotional stuff for the toys game web site etc the voice is a bit melodramatic but it s still kind of neat i like the degree rotating model of the toy you just bought sort of redundant since you can look at the one in real life but nifty all the same one thing that mildly disappointed me is that the rahkshi s weapon isn t really an independanly existing object which is to say that the bar held between the hands is only attached to the hands not the heads of the weapon this isn t a really big deal except that it means you can t have the figure hold the weapon in only one hand this could be rectified with small technic pieces of course but it does mean you d have to add extra bits to the set from somewhere else overall a very cool build it yourself action figure that could either be set to stand looming on your monitor at work or actually played with educational value is limited to following instructions and demonstration of structural principles as in any lego set durability seems good so far lego is pretty sturdy stuff
0,the toy box is nice but im not happy with the product the directions were difficult to understand and i didn t like the top being made of cloth material my little boy already made a tear on it i had to remove it i was afraid my little boy would tear it
1,this publication is in my opinion the most intelligent funny and readable magazine about pc games available it blows the competition offered up by the u s magazines out of the water you get a dual sided dvd loaded with demos movies screenshots podcasts games mods patches and compiled archives of games and hardware recommendations to view from your pc humor which obliterates the drivel attempted by the us version lots of material it s thick and the pages are much bigger in size you feel like you re getting a real magazine rather then a flimsy cheap catalogue of advertisements quality both in the writing and physically there are loads of articles with good insight into the industry every month they are given lots of space and feel very scholarly to read the pages are of good quality paper and the ink is crisp and clear and is easy to read pick up a copy of this from a shop like barnes and nobles sometime to see what it s like i guarantee you ll be impressed especially if you re used to the gaming fare we get served this side of the pond
0,first this piece of trash is based on the journey to the west about as much as raiders of the lost ark is based on the bible there are some characters common to both lost empire and journey well common in name that said let s get to the real problem with this film it is astoundingly insulting to chinese religious traditions imagine for a moment some non christian producing a film in which the god jehova no longer cares what happens to humanity and just gives us over to satan jesus gives up on that sacrifice stuff and is now focused purely on the personal acquisition of wealth and power and the virgin mary comes to earth for a hot night at the singles bars sound offensive it is and this film is equally insulting to buddhism taoism and confucianism the three big ones in china confucius a man revered these past years for his uncompromising moral standards appears in lost empire as a lecherous traitorous lying cowardly weasel the jade emperor taoism s chief god is shown as a despondent apathetic slob who no longer cares about the earthly or celestial realms kuan yin one of the bodhisattvas is shown in lost empire falling in romantic and physical love with a man that is as likely as the virgin mary turning tricks on a street corner if some religious bigot wanted to disguise a piece of anti chinese propaganda as a clever adventure fantasy they could not easily do better than the lost empire it makes me wonder if the insult was intended
1,i ve owned the p for about two years now one thing i m noticing about a couple digital cameras in the amazon reviews is that after a year or so the camera has some kind of error or just dies completely for me this hasn t happened with this camera it s always been great and it has a lot of really convenient features when i bought this camera i knew nothing about cameras i just wanted one really bad for some reason one day and went out and bought this one because it was pretty i got really lucky i mean i only bought it because it was pretty i knew nothing about it but nonetheless i got lucky and bought this camera that takes aa batteries came with a battery charger and its own usb cord it had a ton of settings on it now that i understand more about photography i really like the manual setting the slowest shutter speed is seconds compared to seconds of even newer cameras in its class like i said i never had any problems with it batteries always lasted long took little time to recharge i never even bought a memory card for this camera i use the lowest resolution to take pictures because that s all the given memory card can hold and my pictures are still decent quality i m now looking into a new camera because i do want excellent image quality and ironically ever since i ve been shopping for a new digital camera my sony has been overexposing and underexposing about percent of the shots i take weird anyway if you re looking to buy a sony digital camera based on my experience with this one i d recommend the brand
0,bag was well made but too small can t put much in it nice well made leather bag if it was three times bigger it would be a perfect
1,i have owned both the black monster with bracelet my daily work watch and the orange with the rubber strap which i sold to an envious friend besides all of the compliments that i have received from those who cant help but to notice the robust build of this model it has also paid dividends in durability under rough service on the job i have not been diving in many years however this is the watch that i would be most confident to wear at depth as usual seiko does not disappoint
1,i had been using sweetleaf before buying it at the local super market health food section buying here is around a savings this product works so great at sweetening with no better after taste i just love that it is a natural product
0,i ve listened to this piece of work several times in many positions on various stero systems during different moods and i just can t understand the lyrics half the time and the arrangements were best described as a wall of mud it isn t a question of country music or contemporary music with elh she has demonstrated throughout the years she just loves and respects good music the music is good the woman has impeccable taste but this time i had wished she sat in on the mixing process i think i understand the aim of this collection but geez i wish i didn t i am too accustomed to hearing elh s clear voice slice to the heart of the lyrics take them and present them with a totally unique perspective i won t start on her own playing because this review would be nothing but gushing about her near total mastery of her craft she s an amazing woman artist and collaborator i love her because she is everywhere in music supporting new artists doing background for others her duets are gems of generosity with respect for her fellow artists while always doing what s best for the song i just hope there s no follow up to wb i m very happy with my other elh cds and i m in awe of all roads running and my is going to be front center next week in los angeles it s like waiting for xmas

0,melrose larry green s book is full of quotes quotes and information used to back up points are good things he appears to have researched by surfing the internet watching television and legally incorporating the opinions of others this is all fine and acceptable the problem with why the clintons belong in prison is when the author cut and paste expert attempts his own narrative which is sporadic jumpy and poorly edited his points are not linear and show the author s attention deficit with a proper literary team this book could have been something of note but unfortunately it feels like a hit and run report and reads like a one sided sensationalized talk radio program
1,my wife and i just finished putting this crib together it took a total of minutes start to finish the instructions were extremely easy to follow we bought this exact crib in honey oak months ago for baby number one and it has worked so well we ordered the same crib in white for baby number two our original crib is in the same great shape as when we first put it together the only adjustments we have done where to lower the mattress support heights from higher to lower even that process only took a matter of minutes i have read crib purchase reviews where the box arrived extremely beat up when ours arrived the outside of the box was a little rough but the crib pieces inside are very well packed padded and wrapped and there was not a scratch on the white finish the super saver free shipping arrived at our door days from date of purchase i have never wrote a review for an online purchase before but we are so pleased with our two cribs that i wanted to pass on a very positive message to those who may be comtemplating buying this crib p s i m a physician and this crib could not be any safer no solid side walls or backing just the well spaced rounded slates all the way around and no moving part
1,angela davis stands in my perspective as one of the most accomplished women of the postmodern era this autobiography draws from her childhood to her young adulthood her account of prison life offers an unsentimental analysis of the sexual habits of women in prison one factor that prevents me from giving this memoir a star is her abandonment of her personal life as a woman she focuses entirely on the black power movement in closing this memoir can offer women the strength to fight injustice but encouraging them to first empower themselves
1,it fits a suprisingly large amount of stuff i use it every week to take drinks to sport events it s easy to pack and carry on your back and much easier than those cumbersome boxes

1,the first edition of don t look back was the first dvd i ever bought and i bought a dvd player the same day it is an execellent example of the power and pitfalls of cinema verite direct cinema a style emerging in the made possible by lightweight sound sync cameras and recorders zoom lenses and fast film stock the who threw the f glass altercation followed by the cruel juxtoposition of donovon offering song for you to which dylan responds with a smirk and it s all over now baby blue is one of the great passages in documentary film you may love or hate dylan s music and after watching the film you aren t left with any illusions about him being a nice person but he is a force of nature lyrics poured through him some timely some timeless raw ones and delicate ones for me he was always better on recordings than in person and the film reminds me why but i m glad to have this glimpse of the artist i don t know about the deluxe edition it may be worth it for the higher quality telecine transfer the original film does not need amplification it reveals more about dylan than the bloated no direction home that used so much of the same footage
1,this stuff smells awesome i have it on my bathroom sink and it makes my whole bathroom smell like candy i haven t used it yet because i love the smell so much and i don t want it to go away i just ordered a bunch though so i will try it out they are really pretty too if i was a kid and didn t know any better i would probably try to eat it
0,after watching anthropophagus the grim reaper i came away with mixed feelings on the one hand anthropohagus had its moments albeit quite few where it was somewhat chilling the anthropohagus himself was rather effectively creepy as a horror movie villain some scenes did fairly well building up to a moment of horror but the problem is that these effective moments of horror are few and far between unfortunately the majority of this movie is beset with horrible acting and a very cheaply made horror movie and for some reason it is just very difficult to get over this fact in anthropophagus probably because these weaknesses are so glaring anthropophagus may even have outdone itself with some of the gore scenes so the gore hound shouldn t be disappointed with this flick however with that being said anthropophagus simply is not all that scary except for the few moments that deliver a scare or two to the audience and even those moments are fairly pedestrian when compared to the classic horror movies we have come to know and love ultimately what you have in anthropophagus is horrible acting a poorly written screenplay uneven and poorly developed plot and action below average plot execution just a couple of scary moments some laughable scenes a fairly decent amount of gore and an absolutely disgusting deplorable and depraved scene of violence fetus scene that really crosses all boundaries of horror movies that i ve ever seen and which really offers nothing as far as the merits of the movie are concerned and certainly offers nothing to cinematic horror if that kind of thing appeals to you this could be right up your alley but it doesn t do much for me i would rather find a really compelling storyline and a scary movie that delivers atmospheric tension suspense and a scary story and you simply do not get that in anthropophagus to answer a few questions that could be asked about this movie did anthropophagus bother me no did i think it was scary certainly not laughable at some points in the movie but not scary and nor did i find it disturbing however it can certainly be said that what else do you expect from a low budget italian made horror flick touche in my search for a great horror movie lost in the annals of cinematic horror like a needle in a haystack what did i find in anthropophagus but another shock and gore horror movie with horrible acting and a barely watchable storyline indeed it is very difficult to give this movie any credit a word of advice if you have to try to make yourself like a horror movie even after repeated viewings like i did with this one it probably just sucks for all intents and purposes that is the case with anthropophagus the grim reaper nevertheless sadly i ve seen much much worse
1,the picture and dimensions are incorrect it is a soft case but is ribbed horizontally and mine came in blue the correct dimensions are wxhxd it also fits the fujifilm camera which i bought it for amazon has a different case built specifically for the but it costs more and might be nicer based on that picture i am keeping this one it is a perfect fit
1,this thoughtfully prepared collection of buster keaton movies shorts from early and late in his pre feature period and the feature seven chances show a wide range of comedy styles from slapstick to more refined visual humor to what we would today call situation comedy where laughs come from unusual or embarrassing encounters the earliest in the collection neighbors from is in some way the most satisfying of the set although keaton had not yet here fully developed his mature style of humor here there is still a stylistic resemblance to the earlier association with fatty arbuckle the backyard love affair for example that opens the film resembles arbuckle s classic fatty s plucky pup in neighbors there is more story revolving around the standard theme of feuding parents and the eventual need for the couple to elope there is sweetness youthful energy and innocence in the entire movie as well as great acrobatics including the innovative climactic escape involving two levels of men being carried on the shoulders of other men the balloonatic near the end of the period in which buster was making short films is less rich in comic ideas and lacks the energy and freshness of the earlier film there is almost no slapstick but rather visual humor involving being trapped in a balloon and trying to survive in the wild and win an unwilling girl keaton loves using bodies of water and other objects of nature for comedic props and this film is full of them still for once keaton seems uninspired perhaps making this film to fulfill a contract requirement rather than for love of the story the feature in the set seven chances from is based on a single theme buster the rich boy down on his luck must get married by the end of the day in order to inherit million dollars this absurd premise induces for much of the film a hal roach like situation comedy rather than the visual acrobatic style that is more associated with keaton as buster is cornered into continuously proposing marriage to strangers the variety of embarrassing rejections that buster must endure has funny moments but may not satisfy all of buster s fans the climax however returns us to tried and true keaton formula the lone man being chased by a thundering herd in this case of angry women in full wedding apparel fed up at being duped by a newspaper ad submitted by buster s colleague unbeknownst to buster the chase has satisfying moments including buster dodging large bolders although worth seeing the reliance on the single absurd premise makes this film feel more like a dragged out short movie than a genuine feature the result is a slightly less satisfying encounter with keaton s genius
1,they taste so great i had to limit how many my kids could eat each day
1,i purchased this watch for my year old son it is a eye catching and because it s lego it was an instant hit it has numbers on the face not roman numerals or lines which is important when they are beginning to tell time the price is fair the only complaint he has is that it is very difficult to put on and because the band is plastic it gets a bit sweaty all in all it s a fun cool watch
0,more than human is one of those books that has garnered high praise from the science fiction community because of its strong prose and original ideas the writing is often compared to that of faulkner but i wouldn t make that connection having read a few of faulkner s works sturgeon uses many of faulkner s narrative trademarks i e streaming conscious first person perspective of low iq individuals disorienting changes in first person narrative but i didn t feel the net effect really compared to say something like as i lay dying i love science fiction books and the readers in general love the genre which is why they want it to be taken seriously this results in undue adulation and comparisons to mainstream books more than human is slow dated and not what i would describe as genre transcending nor would i recommend it to others so the idea might of been original in the s but topics like telekenesis esp computer brain babies and self produced morality and ethos have all been tackled more successfully in other science fiction classics before asimov and since this book rarely set off that wow button in my head or kept me turning pages this book simply did not have enough meat in it to make it anything more than mediocre at best in there were hugo award nominees for best science fiction book determined in a retro hugo award ballot in the retro hugo awards are fascinating because the voting in this example takes place years later so the impact of the book on society can t really be ignored besides more than human the far superior the caves of steel childhood s end and farenheit were among the other entries in a banner year for classic sci fi needless to say more than human did not win farenheit did and rightfully so bottom line i wanted to like this book and it doesn t surprise me that others give it such high praise these are probably people that don t read other genres enjoy congratulatory wankfests
1,obviously some people don t care about reviewing an item just about bashing a pop artist that doesn t deserve it anyway i think it smells great obviously it does or it wouldn t be the bestselling perfume right now but don t take my word for it go to your nearest store and give it a sniff also be sure to check out fantasy i think it smells even better
0,i got this as both a book and an audio file i had waited to read it and was surprised by both the enthusiasm of the content and its author but also by how he snuck in some odd biblically unsound thoughts e g i gasped when he suggested christ went to hell what bible passage evidences this i agree with how he suggests the enemy is out to deceive us and keep us asleep but wonder if i go further how much more eldredge will slip in of his own peculiar biblical misintrepretations where were his editors when this was being written why take sensible good sections and mar them with oddities i havent read all the reviews here but as one of those conservatives frequently mentioned in them i have to admit i may not even finish this book for fear of what else eldredge has slipped up on i did appreciate his story about daniel and the delayed angel but am left wondering if i need go deeper into researching that as possible misintepretation too what a shame this book is turning into such a questionable venture for me we are at war as the author suggests and we must guard the source material well the bible well so far i may join others and ditch this valiant attempt to energize christians and return to the word itself i wonder if i can get a refund

1,the only bottles my daughter would take were the playtex original nursers i am pumping at work with a medela pump in style so i was pumping into the medela bottles and then we were transfering the milk into the playtex drop ins to feed her it was a hassle and i never felt like all of the milk especially the fat made it from the medela bottles into the drop ins and then i heard about this kit and bought two immediately i have been so happy with being able to pump directly into the drop ins the only downside you have to buy at least two kits if you double pump

0,as a huge fan of pink sugar and an avid chocolate fanatic i was ecstatic to try out chocolovers since they don t sell chocolovers anywhere near where i live i decided to order it from sephora com in the us first of all i thought the price was fairly reasonable for bottle a very nice bottle and package if i might add it cost me around cdn i was so excited when my order came in today that i quickly opened up the bottle and gave it a sniff ahhh the sickeningly sweet smell of disappointment i don t know what i had been expecting maybe something more like milk chocolate but what i got was a strong citrus cocoa powder burst fading into a very strong and sweet smell almost like turkish delights or raspberries and chocolate with a hint of musk this may sound good but for as much of a fan of sweet candy foody smells as i am i found this one too overpowering and it seriously made me sick right now all i can smell is a sickly sweetness and the smell of flat seven up on the plus side it has stopped completely my cravings for sweets i think if i were trying to diet i would wear this scent everyday i think i will keep it in the hopes that it will grow on me because i really love the look of the bottle and the box it came in i am also going to try and layer it with a cocoa body lotion in hopes that it will tame down some of the sweetness the bottom line is try before you buy
1,this film harks back to a time when africentricity was woven into the psyche of the younger generation blackness informed all of their life decisions and defined their aesthetic this is definitely true of the younger generation in this film another dynamic at play in this film is a sort of intergenerational upheaval some members of the older generation were reconsidering their long held beleifs on what it meant to be black in america while the rest of the older generation stood firm staunchly defending their fossilized ideals so if you re in the mood to see a comedic family film with a post sixties revolutionary air view five on the black hand side and breathe in the culture
0,i bought this game because it sounded like a lot of fun i tried installing it on my dell laptop and no dice it would not run i tried installing it on my dell desktop computer and again it would not run when i went to the knowledge base technical support lists that if you have an integrated video card the game will not work on your system in short if you have an over the counter system you cannot run this game on your computer i find this ridiculous and disappointing i would not suggest buying this game until you go to their technical support page and go over all of the requirements for game play especially since these little facts are not listed on the box

0,if you need a starter or disposable bike carrier this might be okay but not suitable for longer trips or valuable bikes good parts cheap bad parts cheap the adapter for a reciever hitch is horrible you ll have to shim it jury rig something or go to a parts store and pay for a workable one way too much sway which is obvious as you put it together turning corners in town have you checking your mirrors with concern multiply the effect for highway speeds or bumps would need to rig something straps holding the bikes cheap rough on your bike and not very tight in summary if you want to spend alot of time rigging it up to save a few bucks it might be worth it but out of the box i wouldn t trust any worthwhile bike or vehicle with it

0,like many overhead gym type toys this one turns out to be for short or legless babies when my daughter kicks the kickplates she kicks the toy right away from her and this is on carpet and when we brace the toy against something she kicks herself right out from under the toy we have found the same to be true for a number of similarly designed toys now that we have looked at the box more closely the baby in the picture has his her legs bent really hard in order for the baby to fit under the toy our daughter is months old and is already too big for this on a positive note this is a very well made toy in all other respects looks durable as are all chicco toys and the music and lights are pleasant another negative you apparently have to push the two hanging toys to get them to activate sound and lights and most babies want to pull them might be good for a tummy toy but we re not waiting for that we ll try the chicco in gym instead as it appears to be a much better bang for the buck and does not have a kick plate

1,this chocolate was great the first time i used a fondue fountain i used chocolate chips i had no idea you have to melt it beforehand in a pot then add oil to it in order to use it i ended up adding too much oil and ruined the whole thing then someone told me about using liquid chocolate it was so much easier you just have to pour it in and the taste was amazing if i didnt find this i probably would never have used my fountain again

0,i was with sprint for almost years all told i had a picture mail account with them for about years just recently without any warning whatsoever they deleted over of my precious pictures from my picture mail account pics that had been accumulating and many of which had been safely and soundly sitting there for most of that period of time most of these pics were very important to me and are now lost forever i had only backed up about of them i guess it was my own fault for trusting sprint but they offered no real explanation and when i tried to have the pics recovered not only could they not do that but they said they had no record of me ever having the picture account that i had with them for almost three years this is the worst thing any service company has ever done to me so my advice don t trust sprint again this happened with any warning it could happen to you too trust me avoid sprint at all costs i should have
0,i have to rate this product and this company as horrible i purchased the in everything was fine in the lamp blew less than hours on it i called the company they said sometimes it happens i questioned the projector they said i just needed a new lamp later oh you can only get the lamps from them you can only get service on the from them i get the new lamp it just blew again about hours half of what the life should be additionally the fan died which may be why the lamp blew maybe there was a problem with the fan a year ago when it was still under warranty but they wouldn t look at it no they say no the projector was ceiling mounted and never moved since it was first put in place the projector was blown clean on a regular basis this projector was not mistreated or misused infocus says sometimes this happens they for plus shipping will fix the fan i also need to buy a new lamp another the company keeps saying it is out of warranty sometimes this happens hours is just what some lamps get etc etc etc they will not accept that perhaps this was a defective product i will get a new projector i can buy a new one for what they want to charge to maybe fix my current one my new projector will not will never be an infocus product they have failed to stand behind their product their service is overpriced and their technical support and customer service is nothing more than drones citing manuals and warranties don t buy infocus
1,i like this video for it s frankness and straight forward approach of a woman enjoying herself like yoga it requires slowing down and noticing how your body feels while your watching it the energy slowly rises and the woman increases it by playing with the tempo and rhythm of her touches the quality of her session is unhurried and she is very relaxed and keeps her body still but her finger is moving in synchronicity with her orgasm i found that in itself very interesting and different it is refreshing to find a product that is different from the common depiction of women emulating ecstasy but one in which shows a woman actually really feeling what it feels like to create it in her body and show what it looks like she shows a way of masturbating and stretching the sensation out that can really tweak your reality of how much pleasure a woman is capable of experiencing a mind bender so to speak and it challenges the cultural limitations of what orgasm is for a woman and how she experiences it
0,i bought this to keep sun out of my little ones eyes when we re out running not only do the tabs not stick as any toddler would she protested being behind a curtain during when she just wanted to see the world wouldn t you
1,i ve owned several watches including the older g shock and the casio men s g shock atomic solar watch among others first there are so many g shock models to choose from you could have bought the the stainless steel model for the same price during the week of july this watch simply has everything one ever needs for time functionality solar power no need for daily rewinding kinetic body movement or batteries synch with the atomic clock in colorado ultimate accuracy time zone adjustment ease for jet setters light button which also goes off when you tilt your wrist stop watch functionalities day date functionalities and countless other time related functions in this respect it s much more functional than a patek even the complicated wrist watch models or the more mundane rolex etc of course it s a lowly casio costing a mere vs for a low end complicated patek buyers should be aware that the watch is purtty bulky probably to in thick one needs a sporty forearm wrist to go with this watch for the fun of wearing it couple times a year the price and just to look at it as part of a collection of watches i d highly recommend it

0,adobe audition is my favorite program i use it more than any other program i have on my computer i have used it to restore thousands of old phonograph discs i am only giving them one star because i can t give them no stars for this joke i knew this was going to happen i had been using cool edit pro for a long time when adobe bought it and i knew that they were going to turn it into an adobe product and screw it all up i am very fortunate that i went to adobes web site and downloaded the free trail version i would have been really upset if i had actually paid money for this dog lets start with the boot up time i own a year old average laptop and audition used to boot in about seconds takes seconds that is almost as long as photoshop or premiere pro next we have the user interface they destroyed it and the old one worked so well adobe is really hung up about making absolutely everything a palette and so now every little thing is a palette allowing you to resize and relocate them to your hearts desire but after about a half an hour of trying i ll be darned if i could not make the interface remotely resemble the interface the shortcuts buttons have been removed wow that makes a lot of sense however you can get it back if you look long enough for the place to do it don t bother to right click anything in their imperial wisdom right clicking is now pretty useless but if you do put the shortcuts back up they are now all black and white and it is really difficult to find the one you want in place of the shortcuts they added some icons that i have yet to figure out or to need what are they thinking a lot of the presets have been reconfigured and trying to figure them out gave me a headache after several hours of playing with this pile of garbage i decided to uninstall it and return to using

1,after hours of play so far i have gotten a lot more enjoyment out of this game than i did when reading the first three books of the series which themselves probably took less than hours to read where shall i begin describing this really fun game the characters themselves are realistically animated and the sunny animations are especially amusing with the way that she bites things squeals does little dances etc i ve smiled and laughed a lot just at how well the characters were represented voices are very good including the use of some of the major actors appearing in the upcoming film although their use is not pervasive during normal game play the scenario is great fun far more involving than the books so far playing the piano to break it apart and get it open was a real riot the settings are creepy with little roaches crawling about and rats and spiders and such the game reaches the level of art who did the soundtrack the music is awesome and wondrous after the dingy mansion of count olaf there are episodes of light relief that fill the player with a sense of peace and wonder the library scene uncle monty s house and garden the garden with butterflies flapping by grass blowing wondrous music playing and the big tree adventure with klaus flying over the greenery rivers etc finally made me see this video game as reaching a level of artistic accomplishment like a good painting to just get lost in and enjoy all the details and sensory input wow and at first i was concerned that i might get through the game too quickly after hours though and only being midway through i know i m getting my worth for i will surely play through the whole thing more than once just as one watches a favorite video or takes a hike along a favorite forest path i calculate that at about per hour this game is giving a far better return than seeing the film in the theater when it comes out although i plan to do that too and that s not even counting the game s resale value afterward in addition there are some special game features that tie in with the film with players eventually awarded with film photos information a v from and about the film one extra note to game players is that i don t think players will get a great deal of benefit from the bradyguide to this game that game guide is poorly mapped and far from comprehensive while the instruction manual that comes in the game itself gives enough instruction and detail to allow players to start and proceed save yourself by avoiding the bradyguide because a map you make yourself while playing will likely be far more useful halfway through the game so far i only got about two useful tips from that guidebook and i would have figured those clues out on my own anyway
1,i did a great deal of research on the internet for the best shower filter i was concerned about the filter not lasting losing water pressure etc i came across the aquasana on amazon and read all the great reviews on it after ordering it i am so glad that i did it was really easy to install and i honestly feel like the water pressure coming out of it is better than with my old shower head the shower head swivels and has several different settings like massage rainfall type flow etc it really does feel like you are showering in spring water just the idea of showering in chlorine free and mineral free water is refreshing in itself i am really happy with my purchase and would definitely recommend it to anyone living in an apartment who wants filtered water and who cannot install a filter on the main line it s a little pricy but well worth it
0,i just purchased this product from a high end specialty gift shop for it was the exact same item
0,good black tea is not hard to find just hard to find in your grocery store the honest truth is that tazo really does not make many if any really good teas this in particular is one of their worst it is bitter and leaves a bad taste in your mouth immediately every time i get stuck in a starbucks with friends i am faced with the choice tea chai or steamed milk every time i cave in and give tazo another chance it disappoints me if you want a good black tea look for a local tea shop and let them brew you a few cups try a keemun a lapsang and maybe golden dianhong and see how it goes if you really want to kick it up a notch look for a cameroonian black take it from someone who really loves tea this stuff is not worth your time and when you get good tea please don t brew it in your coffee maker
1,this stuff is awesome for hangovers it was like my high school staple i mean i went through like a box a week at least give it a try
0,it seems that even the best bands have only a finite number of great melodies in them and the flower kings exhausted theirs in their first four cds here we have yet another double helping of their ageless wisdom strewn across two cds to our fiduciary detriment though not as crass and offensive as stolt s wall street voodoo or bodin s i am this is nevertheless lyrically naive to the level of silliness there are a few good instrumental passages mixed in this release but not enough to justify its purchase stolt said in a recent interview something to the effect that peace love never go out of fashion well neither does informed maturity and you won t find any of that in this group s recent output just more utopian preaching and good vs evil typecasting their liner notes advocate sending money to greenpeace and amnesty international but i would counter that any american would be better investing their extra cash at st jude s children s hospital i m going to sell my copy of paradox hotel and probably several more flower kings cds to do just that there are some sick children out there who need our support and encouragement far more than these would be hippies
1,this is a great cot it is low profile and made of strong materials i was worried about the wire legs but they are very very strong so strong that it takes some muscle to get them into their holes in the frame this might be a drawback for someone who is weak in the arms it folds up easy and is very portable also i have a smaller frame and although this cot is perfect for me a larger frame person might want to consider a wider version for comfort in the shoulder area you won t be disappointed in this one for the money
0,while i have been very pleased with the performance of this product configuration and setup was very easy and even updates to the device are easy to do it s not reliable it seems that every or days i lose connection to the internet this is a pc network couple of servers there really isn t huge bandwidth being used but it is like it gets frozen you can t ping it you can t get to anything on the outside like the gateway or dns servers and a simple power reset gets it working again nothing is in the log i have to believe this is some sort of firmware problem i have checked all the ideas on netgear s site without help i know at least some of the time it freezes during the middle of the night when no one is using it could it be getting zapped from the outside somehow but it sure is not reliable i can t recommend it

1,being a bodybuilder i hoist heavy weights all the time a major stress especially when it comes to squats i ordered the boots when i realized i had shrunk to from being i was thusly very happy when after approximately weeks of hanging times a week min intervals that i am nearly back to my original height i highly suggest this product as a supplement to good emphasis on good chiropractic care to those who have will order this product don t be discouraged if it seems to hurt your back at first that s totally normal because your back is trying to readjust while the discs which cushion the vertebrate start rehydrating also it will take some time to find the strap tightness that s right for your legs generally tighter on the top strap and looser on the bottom is a good combination p s hang from a real pull up bar and make sure you have someone to spot you if you are not strong enough to pull yourself back up the bar to unlatch yourself

1,i received my original new native sling as a baby shower gift back in i wore it nearly every day for months and then again with babies and now we are expecting our fourth baby and the fabric is a bit faded and worn we have the purple one so i thought it time to buy a second sling the original is still good as far as the stitching goes and we ll still use it but i m a bit tired of the purple color after nine years pros this sling is the smallest as far as packing it with you it s a simple double band of fabric that can be folded up in your bag or purse easily men don t mind wearing it at least my husband didn t it comes in basic solid colors and doesn t scream baby when you re out and about many people couldn t tell i was wearing the baby when she was little it s a good place for the baby to nap and to cover you up a bit when you nurse once you figure that out it s more versatile than other types of baby carriers in that you can use it from newborn to toddler i ve even used it with two year olds for short periods when they are tired of walking and the stroller isn t an option you can carry the baby on your front or back with experience this is doable but mostly for older babies on your hip once your baby can sit strongly it s also easy to throw in the wash when the baby s diaper inevitably leaks or spits up all over it no complicated latches webbing or snaps to clean cons if you get the wrong size the baby will hang too low and your back will hurt my original is the large size based on chest measurements from the manufacturer but i m going to order a medium this time my husband still likes the large but he has a longer torso than i newborns may need some support in the new native sling otherwise you may feel they are swimming in the fabric i always use a tightly rolled up receiving blanket and place it in the sling first then lay the baby s head and back on top of it this pushes the baby up enough toward the opening so that you don t feel like she s lost in there usually i only do this for the first few weeks after a while your baby will be big enough to peek out on her own and wave at people the trickiest thing with the new native carrier is learning to sling the baby on your back which enables you to do things like cooking and unloading the dryer while your baby sleeps you have to put the baby in on your front first then shimmy the fabric around with the baby in it if you can master this the sling is ideal for the fussy baby or for all day babywearing highly recommended good value for your money
1,a lot of my friends like to shop online so i added this to my baby registry my best friend received one at her shower and she loves it so when i got two at my shower it wasn t the disaster other duplicate gifts can be my little girl is now three months old and we are still getting a lot of use out of the fresh whole rabbits
0,here s my theory in regards to how one should rate a remix album if a song is remixed then that remix should be better than the original song otherwise what s the point with that being said nu mixx klazzics is pretty much pointless this is nothing more than a cash in album the people at death row koch know that folks will continue to buy pac s music as long as you can manage to put a new spin on it especially the die hards they ll buy anything associated with the man well the spin they put on this particular album is just plain terrible if you have the source material stick with that these remixes don t make the originals better they actually make them worse the beats sound like throw away beats from an old jt tha bigga figga album and some of the lyrics have been altered changed so that they sound updated removing snoop from of amerikka s most and distorting pac s vocals when he says his name is just terrible but these changes are only for the worst in short all aspects of this album are sorry the guests are wack and the beats are generic hollow clubby beats remember y all when these albums were dropped back in the beats had more meat to them there is one decent track though life goes on gets a different look and i m not so sure that it s all that bad i find it tolerable but i could see why why someone wouldn t like it but this is coming from someone that wasn t all that crazy about the original because i wasn t feeling the beat if you enjoyed the original then stick with that also i like that the original version of hit em up was used here in this version pac can be heard giving props to east coast emcees that he was cool with thus proving that he wasn t anti east coast just anti bad boy whoever gave the green light to have this released should be fired it s a shame that folks are pimping tupac s music like this but they ll continue to do it as long as folks continue to buy it i m drawing the line here shame on you suge your label isn t relevant anymore get over it and move on standout tracks don t even waste your time looking for an
0,i watched this film yesterday at a library and found its lack of depth and analysis to be dumbfounding during the first minute they tell how the revolution began when high bread prices sparked a violent uprising during the next minutes they narrate the chronological events of increasing violence using acted scenes fake blood and sound bytes from scholars to give a play by play summary of the carnage and beheadings leading up to a mention of napoleon during the last thirty seconds they surprisingly conclude by saying that the french revolution was a very good thing because it inspired china and vietnam and because louis was a tyrant prior to this little or no mention had been made of louis tyranny although the film had dwelt on his bedroom difficulties in some detail and also mentioned his weight problem a few times after watching minutes of bloody scenes i found the films conclusion that the french revolution was a good thing to be an incomprehensible non sequitur i would have liked to have seen some historical analysis to support this conclusion

0,im computer literate and regularly use a number of varying programs from visio to logic audio to ms office after picking up illustrator however im frustrated by the lack of intuition and steep learning curve the software offers ive been told that the world revolves around types of people those who get vector graphic programs and those who errrr dont unfortunately after hours use and much manual reading i fall into the later category i dont plan to give up however and plan to enroll in a course this decision was supported by friends proficient in its use but who had difficulty demonstrating the complex concepts to me indeed defining the direction of a drawn curve was as intuitive as metaphsyics or nuclear science so my advice is this be extremely carefull if youve never used illustrator before it may be a breeze to those well versed in its use but to an absoloute beginner its an extremely difficult program to grasp and you may be dissapointed to find this out after youve forked out your hard earned dollars for it
1,i am writing to offset some negative opinions on this unit i bought the canon because it has facilities for an external mike i am a new camcorder user and so have no practical experience to bias my opinion one way or another first on the matter of tape drive noise yes i can hear it if i put the unit up to my ear but no noticeable noise comes up on actual movie clips when played back through my computer second they claim you can interconnect and capture clips to your computer what they don t tell you is that you need a firewire card and cable about total at best buy you cannot simply hook up through the available computer usb port fortunately microsoft provides the necessary drivers in the xp os and minimal capture software called moviemaker i am not too pleased with the tape system but considering the price of the unit i think it is a bargain finally i have become aware through short experience with the unit that the ergonometric design for the right hand was very well thought out your thumb easily controls on off and tape transport functions it is really easy to use at least for right handed users all considered i am satisfied with the product of course if it dies next week i will have a different opinion
0,for our first baby we were determined to stay away from the lure of cute but unnecessarily expensive baby items this was one of the few items we did not research and we purchased this tub thinking any tub would work we were wrong the tub is too slippery which causes his head to endlessly roll back and forth into the corners the slant of the tub is also meant for a larger baby which causes his head to dig into his chin which he hates bathtime is about bonding so after a month and a half of fighting we ended up taking our baths together my son prefered the skin to skin contact anyways the tub is also a poor fit for any oval sink bathroom and the one time i put it in the kitchen sink i filled it with water and it buckled never tried it again if you want to wash your baby in the sink get a foam sponge or a bath support specifically made for newborns even for dollars i would not buy this tub again granted it might work for some but if you have a fussy or even mildly fussy baby i would not recommend this tub
1,ok here s the deal i hate chemicals i am a health nut i hate greasy moisturizers i love to get the most out of everything i do you know that ny or s philosophy of multi tasking or why do thing when you can do the solution is kinerase realtively chemically good if it wipes off on the baby when we hug it s no biggy i think the worst thing in it is methylparaben which is in everything even baby products so whatever and i can moisturize while i get a serious healthy skin glow on my face that does not quit i think it s made for wrinkles but i am not worrying about that yet so i use it for the clear skin glow thing that i have always wanted the skin of my dreams i barely use skin makeup anymore because my once icky skin that s a clinical term has been literally transformed buy buy buy i kid you not it s worth every penny

1,it seems that just about every house in our subdivision has an electric ride on toy there are few barbie jeeps few polaris atvs one corvette and three gators and few others my year old daughter was the first gator owner i must say it is expensive this thing is by far the most expensive toy my daughter has bar none should you buy your year old ride on toy well that s up to you but she loves her gator she had to give up on lot of other toys to get this one but she is extremely happy with it sometimes i wish i was so i can ride this thing she can t care less about the barbie thing so this green utility machine was fine with her the gator is slightly faster than others and the fat tires and truck bed makes the gator looks a lot more serious than the barbie jeep the truck bed is really useful although not recommended she hauled two kids on the bed with kids on the car it still zoomed around the street quite well one time i loaded nail gun air compressor electric drill and jigsaw and panel saw all on the bed and asked my daughter to drive to the other side of the yard to fix the fence i saw our neighbor hauling few bags of mulch on theirs it made such a funnt scene little electric toys carrying real tools and stuff very cute enough of fun stuff problem battery location and the hassle to recharge this thing you have to open the front grill and sometimes the latch can pinch your finger it hurts problem the left front wheel fell off while my daughter was driving it i tightened it again and never happened problem slipping tires people complain about the tires having very low friction they slip very easily on driveway and grass but this is how it protects its gearbox so i don t really care but i heard they are expensive once they wear out i think this is the best ride on toy on the market today if extra won t hurt you too much then do consider the gator your children will not be disappointed
1,many people know about john wayne and john ford s cavalry trilogy three of the greatest westerns ever made but another pairing between the two is not as well known the three godfathers is a lesser known john wayne classic when he was at the top of his game starring harry carey jr and pedro armendariz as the other two godfathers this classic should not be missed these three outlaws ride into the desert after a bungled robbery only to find a dying woman with a newborn infant the duke promises to care for the baby which she names robert william pedro hightower after the three outlaws they must then make the trek across the desert with very little supplies to get the baby to the next town excellent supporting cast with many recognizable faces from other duke movies with ward bond playing the sheriff who attempts to track down the outlaws truly funny scenes as wayne armendariz and carey attempt to care for the baby as usual awesome scenery as is expected in john ford westerns this is one classic that has to be put on dvd a must have for john wayne fans
1,really worth seeing to learn about the life and talent of budd boetticher the collectors edition allows you to watch for the elements of the film that make it special
1,i remember when doom first came out there was a lot of hype on the internet people were claiming it would blow away the release of half life with id s new engine etc etc etc unfortunately doom is a rather standard shoot em up it s fun for a little while but it lacks the originality and inventiveness of games like half life which was amazing half life kept me engaged because the terrain changes the characters change and so on in doom it s basically just a lot of walking around through dimly lit corridors monsters jump out and you kill them it s fun for a while but then it becomes tiring much like a haunted house ride would become tiring after five hours straight furthermore the graphics engine really isn t what everyone made it out to be i just bought a new pc this year and it runs this game very well on maximum settings the gameplay isn t choppy or anything but even at full potential with graphics i think they re just ok the shadowing is brilliant but the textures are average and some of the characters in the cut scenes are downright laughable one of the commanders early on looks like a character from avp and that game came out in the in game play is much better characters look more realistic but i have to wonder what the rush was with the cut scenes one would think they d spend more attention to detail on these overall i have to admit that while i found this fun at times it gets tedious after a while i mean the gimmick with the flashlight is annoying as someone else pointed out i think in the beginning it s okay but they should have planted an upgrade early on in the game such as a helmet with a flashlight attached to the top or nightvision goggles that last for a minute or two before they have to be recharged because dropping your flashlight and picking up a weapon while you re being shot at by enemies is annoying and as another reviewer pointed out the pda gimmick gets old fast overall this has moments of absolute brilliance but i felt like so much more could have been done with it they should have abandoned the concept of being alone in the dark throughout the entire game and done a bit more with it i would have loved to have explored the martian planet more or even levels that don t look exactly the same because the repetitive nature of the game is ultimately what sinks it it s good but i think half life was far better and the graphics engine on hl was stunning even two years later
0,usually i discount negative reviews i think people may have sour grapes against a company or not understand how to install or work something i somewhat tech savvy i installed our wireless network that took a little doing i work as a technical recruiter so technology doesn t intimidate me i like technology so i had been nudging my husband for a print server so that i could print without going to the printer and plugging in he came home with this belkin product and went about installing it usually i like to research before i purchase a product but he wanted to handle this so he installed it and i went back and checked his work and he had followed the instructions exactly i know he had some trouble and had called tech support at my suggestion i would never have gotten the wireless router hooked up without tech support the only problem is that the printserver doesn t work so i tried installing the software on my pc and trying to problem solve from there i called the tech support hotline back and got an operator who promised to have a technician call me back in a short period of time i waited for hours then went out to run some errands there was still no message from a technician when i returned this morning my husband needed to get some work done from home he created a document and knowing that the print server did not work he wired up to the printer to print that way but now the printer won t respond to the signal so he can t print that way either so we deleted the belkin software and rebooted the computer he still can t print so i went back to my pc and tried to delete the software through the control panel it won t delete i am getting an error message i can t print either so now i am on hold with belkin customer assistance maybe it s a coincidence but as good as the english is that the person who refers to himself as an operator is i swear i hear a little indian accent that doesn t mean that customer support has been outsourced to india and even if it is that doesn t mean customer support is bad but my experience with this is that while i can get a real live person on the phone he can t do a thing to help me except promise me that someone will call back when i tried to get my problem escalated i overwhelmed him and he put me on hold i am still on hold i have been on hold for minutes with no help in sight i called back from my cell phone and someone who sounded so much like the first operator i spoke to said he would escalate my call to a level technician and someone would call back in hours when i strongly protested asked for his name asked for a number i could call directly he offered to transfer me immediately and now i have been on hold for for an additional minutes on my cell phone i am starting to sense a trend here my husband boiling over his inability to print an important document has gone off to work to print it there i am sitting on my sofa with phones going on in stereo waiting to see if anyone in cyberspace is going to pick up my call i usually discount negative reviews but this is really my experience with this product and if you are considering purchasing it i would encourage you to think that through a little further
1,this chaise lounge made for the perfect addition to my deck the cushion is durable thick and extremely comfortable with velcro ties to keep the cushion in place from sliding it truly is a beautiful piece there was a slight mix up with the shipping but once everything was straightened out the lounger was delivered just as scheduled the delivery guys even brought the box around to my backyard and on to my deck the chair comes completely assembled all you do is open the box and enjoy
1,you ve read a lot of reviews to get to this one most likely and they ve gone on about how great it looks it does look tremendous how fantastic the gameplay is it is awe inspiring and how just absolutely great of a gaming experience it is there are a few things that i would like to add first off there is one slight problem with the game personally with action games of the person variety i like to be able to control the camera this game does not have that instead you are taken where the gamemakers want you to go and only what they want you to see this is a very slight complaint and one i m hoping will be improved with god of war ii the second thing that i would like to add is that the mythological aspect of this game is great it really gives the game a very epic scale that is not found in a great many games it s the thing that drives this game farther than it usually would it s a tremendously entertaining and oft times thought provoking game that has a sense of gravitas that most action slice em dice em games of this type get to get it
1,this movie is hours of kids being amoral creatures doing whatever strikes their fancy at the moment sex drugs beating on people stealing whatever keeps boredom at bay there is no script to speak of just watching them being themselves one kid called telly about or who has aids and may not know it likes young virgins to year old girls he s a predator with no conscience at all probably a sociopath and his buddy casper is a dumb punk who swills beer he s just as bad as telly i have no doubt that teens like this exist they existed back in the when i was a teen i m sure most of the viewers of this disturbing movie don t have children perhaps parents need to view this to see what unsupervised teens are doing i m sure kids like this are not just only in the slums but in suburbia too and small towns and even rural areas this movie isn t for the squeamish but if one parent watches and starts giving their child more attention it might be worth a sleepless night or a feeling of revulsion for them
1,i also found this item at target for if you buy it at amazon or ebay your wasting your money
1,the doll is wonderful and my granddaughter thinks it is her best birthday gift i also want to especially compliment and thank amazon for their excellent handling of this purchase i made a mistake when ordering and they very promptly helped me to correct it i look forward to doing business with amazon in the future
0,this camera will probably go down in nikon s history as one of its most over priced and disappointing cameras i bought mine through amazon from calumet in january from the start the colors never looked right especially the ghastly magenta toned skin tones i also bought the of them thinking the cls would be a great addition but the system uses ir and is unreliable in any situation except very tight environments the camera has a wonderful feel viewfinder and reasonably good controls but the results are disappointing the sensor is undersized for this class of camera and considering what its competition canon offers nikon finally realized this and on dec decided to dump all these cameras by lowering the price it just so happened mine was in melville n y with a long list of issues to be repaired while it was still under warranty these include bad af performance since upgrading to of the firmware bad color overexposure blurry images with the vr lens and inconsistent color balance from frame to frame even when using a preset value i would strongly suggest that you don t buy this camera and thereby reward nikon for producing an inferior product originally sold at a ridiculous price for what it offers indeed forget nikon and go to canon
1,lathers well with a pleasant subtle scent shipping costs spoil some of the fun you might consider barclaycrocker given its shipping and product costs
1,i thought when i ordered these chaise lounges they would only be temporary until i could afford good ones because they were so inexpensive well these are good and i don t need to replace them the design actually matches my table set and i didn t even realize it until we unpacked them fully assemled i only have one complaint and it s really not that bad the thickness of the cushion seems fine for me but my skinny butt husband tells me the cushions aren t cushiony enough other than that the chaises are absolutely wonderful and good quality
1,i caught sonny in a live performance this past november so i got to hear at least tracks off of his most current album sonny please he opened the set with a fiery sonny please which smoked for a good minutes i believe that victor lewis was on traps that night so the percussion section helped do the driving for a man approaching years of age i was impressed with not only sonny s playing and gracious presence but his stamina in performing two minute sets trust me the man can still play this album may not be another saxophone colossus or the bridge but it is a solid recording and should satisfy a majority of sonny s fans if you have no recorded music by this jazz legend this cd is a respectable starting point
1,what i like about this magazine is that the articles are unique and informative i have bought the last three issues and can t wait for the next one this magazine covers equipment in a current mode rather than a months to a year behind style so familiar with many of the other photography magazines this magazine provides me some much needed diversion because it captures my attention each time i have picked one up every article is telling me about or showing me how to implement the lastest techniques from the best photographers in the industry at the beginning of this year i noticed that some of the popular or modern digital review magazines were running the same old head to head comparisons of consumer cameras that have been out for the better part of a year now i need to see the technology that is cutting edge or even around the corner so far this magazine is giving me the best bang for my buck good luck
1,this is a great gown for the price it s comfy soft and there is even a small bit of support for the big busted girls out there moreover it s sexy hope yall enjoy
0,all of us have a dark side unfortunately auto focus focuses on this small subset of actor bob crane s life and expands it out of proportion in doing so the movie reduces the other voluminous and interesting aspects of crane s life and career as window dressing even the screenplay is at best an uneducated guess at the evening escapades of bob crane and john h carpernter since both are deceased with the former murdered and the latter the twice accused murder suspect in viewing this film i knew that it would involve some of crane s extracurricular activities my interest in the film was as a hogan s heroes fan and hopeful that the movie would spend more time on the back stage politics and production of the successful six year series bob crane s professional credits alone would make for a good film auto focus unfortunately revolves around crane s so called secret life and is little more than a product for the risque film crowd facts are facts and there are established truths about bob crane s private life auto focus however should be approached as a fictionalized story straight out of a grocery store scandal magazine you are better off spending your time and money buying the dvd releases of the hogan s heroes television series
0,i too have stacks of organic gardening and farming i love to go back and visit robert rodale too bad it has become a political bullypulpit i would not subscribe again with out a major change
1,this is the best invertebrate zoology textbook on the market perhaps the best ever written the authors are not content to merely present in fine detail the classification anatomy physiology behavior and ecology of invertebrates they present alternative interpretations and controversial opinions where these topics are concerned in that way invertebrate zoology comes alive as an active important and relevant field of study for understanding the ecology and evolutionary relationships of these organisms in a global setting i highly recommend this book for a course of study or as a reference for earth science instructors who wish to solidify and deepend their knowledge and understanding of invertebrates
0,this magazine is just page after page of hollywood p r agencies releases unbelievable why didn t i think of it i know all magazines look for editorial content from outside sources but other than a few pages of very subjective movie music book reviews this magazine just re writes and prints hollywood press release after hollywood press release again and again and again this magazine must not have a staff of writers but must employ an army of copy editors manning a warehouse of dedicated fax machines or e mail inboxes the funniest thing about this magazine is how the first few pages may be dedicated to a typically obsequious press release provided by say tom cruise s management company major film studio hired pr flak fawning over cruise or his newest movie and then you turn to the movie review section where some clever sassy wanna be hipster movie reviewer proceeds to tell you that the movie absolutely sucks uh okay wait didn t you get the press release if you tivo extra and have the theme to entertainment tonight as your ringtone this magazine is right up your alley otherwise don t waste a penny on this nonsense

0,i notice several other reviews mentioning faulty defective consoles arriving well i received my first schwinn about a month ago i put it all together and realized they did not ship an ac adapter with the machine i contacted amazon they told me to either send the machine back for another or contact the manufacturer i contacted the manufacturer on saturday they were closed i contacted them the following monday and they told me the item was on back order but i could buy a compatible adapter from radio shack i did i came home excited to use my elliptical unfortunately the console did nothing but beep at me very frustrating i contacted the manufacturer again they advised me that the console was on backorder and would not be delivered for at least months they recommended i send the unit back to amazon for a replacement i did so i spent the better part of a night taking the thing apart and repackaging it quite a job trying to squeeze it back in the box about weeks later i received my second elliptical same faulty console problem after spending another couple of hours putting the thing together contacted amazon and demanded a full refund and return they did pick the unit up and did not make me take it all apart this time but i am still awaiting a full refund i have since purchased a vision fitness elliptical from a real fitness shop in my area i am extremely happy with the unit although it was a few hundred bucks more this was one horrific experience with amazon i wouldn t recommend buying this product seems like they are shipping out defective units

0,i have about two to three years of knit n style magazines and lately have spent a lot of time looking through them for a cardigan pattern to knit for myself i haven t found a single one all of the patterns have serious faults drop shoulders totally unacceptable little or no armhole neck and or shoulder shaping most sleeves have little or no cap and worst of all they are all made in five or more pieces haven t any of these designers heard of elizabeth zimmerman i was going to give the lot to the library but am wondering if perhaps the trash might be a better place if you are trying to attract new knitters from among younger people why don t you teach them the proper way to knit young people are smarter than you think
0,i bought my wife a brand new for her birthday she wanted an extra charger to take to work so i bought this one big mistake it simply would not fit in the charger jack so basically it s a worthless piece of plastic last night when my wife was cleaning the counter she threw it in the trash brand new box and all at it wasn t even worth the trouble to try to return it don t make the same mistake i did

1,been waiting for my parts supplier to carry this item for a while seen it on audis and other german cars for a while and adverts on various car mags etc if your thinking think no more buy it
0,the first half of this movie starts out promising the half is not so good it becomes slowly predictable and stereotypical whereas it started out charming and promising of particular annoyance is the ending where we find the hackneyed politically correct stereotype of the husband having to admit culpability for all the wrongs of the couple s separation and the woman never having to admit her half of the bargain despite the fact that she was clearly as poor a communicator as he indeed the wife s character is strikingly uneven in this movie her personality appears to be one thing in the first half of the movie but she seems to become a whole different person by the second half quite inconsistent
1,this is the first workout i attempted after the birth of my daughter the first few times were a major challenge but i have been doing it times per week for months now and not only have i actually stuck with it but i have my pre pregnancy body back i really don t feel i can say enough good things about this video my boyfriend and i do this video together and we have both been very impressed and the best part as i get better i can focus more acutely on the relevant muscle group and maintain the difficulty of the workout i highly recommend this video for all levels
1,this is beck s coming of age album loser was a single that was designed from the bottom up to be a hit single and mellow gold landed beck right smack center of mainstream pop culture for an entire generation his earlier recordings featured in an album entitled one foot in the grave were evidence enough of his musical genius mellow gold might have represented an electro acoustic adolescence for beck if that s the case then mutations was his rite of passage a moment of maturation that moves beyond the playful tongue in cheek wittiness of his previous album mutations has dark brooding moments with haunting melodies his lyrics inspire curiosity and sadness in one song he sings looking back on some dead world that looks so new we can t always be sure of his references or implications but the music in this album is fascinating and darkly beautiful his ambiguity of language is infectious and the compositions that he rests his words in are dynamic and graceful with mutations beck has secured an important place in music history this is a body of work that really goes far beyond album sales and radio play the arrival of this album shows us an artist finding a moment of clarity and touching the world with his craft
0,this book sucked because its like an autobiography of some idiot who knew nothing about what he was doing his book is mostly life stories and stupid ones at that some teeter the line of racism he emphasizes attempting to hex some evil fat black woman and he demonizes some other young brothers later on in the book i see most of the reviewers overlooked the fact that this guy was kind of out of line with his emphasis on race and besides that his or spells and such are old and tired and there is no self initiation for the type of voodoo he s talking about i am sorry but this book was a waste of time and money i came away from this little book knowing not one single solitary grain of anything worth knowing if you looking to learn about voodoo or vodun this book will not help his title is also misleading because voodoo ussually refers to hoodoo and vodun ussually refers to the religion but this author isnt talking about either one he s just running his mouth on and on and on as if his life experiences are even worth tellin this book is a great example to why people of a foriegn back ground to african based religions should not write books about it as if they could really know but so much this was a terrible book that this sorry author made about a system he obviously knows nothing about
0,psychology today is just another glamour cosmo people disguised as a magazine discussing issues in psychology this magazine used to be well written and had more scientific data however since the appointment of the new editor headlines became similar to that of tabloid magazines all over if you are interested in scientific data and research this is not the magazine for you i used to subscibe to psychology today but stopped renewing since i took more psychology classes becuase i found out that the magazine had no new insights to offer in the field of psychology at all
1,its a great product it coats when it rains when you just put it on you dont even need to use the wipers but it does take some work to make sure its not smeared looking clean your glass good with windex first then apply and polish off i dont really buy any of those as seen on tv items but this is the first one that really works well also if you side windows squeak this will help with that as well since is a slippery it will help with weather stripping remember this works best when over about and you will have to keep reapplying a few times a yea
0,my child loves geotrax and plays with them everyday however big city lights makes your track look good but doesn t have much for a child to interact the crane has a crank to turn but the bricks are hard to get to stick in the clamp and besides a button for sounds that is about all this has to offer unlike other pieces with geomotion this one is a bore my child rarely plays with this piece except to watch the rc trains go under it
1,this movie has been on my top list for years although the quality of the movie is poor by today s standard it is worth it to see the transformation of this young woman don t miss this movie
0,in amazon s ultimate wisdom they will not return or exchange items from their grocery store even though it is in beta status i ordered these in good faith as they appeared to be the normal packaging but be warned that these contain splenda and so may not be suitable for everyone i d avoid the amazon grocery store at all costs going forwards
1,very easy to use and provides a very wide range of cards and other items excellent product dav
0,anxiously awaited this very expensive box of cards mostly for the special insert cards but there was only the autograph card and no memorabilia card you cannot realize the disappointment one feels when this happens you look and look searching through the wrappers and identify each card hoping that you missed it somehow but no no memorabilia card as promised right on the box and in all advertised articles of course the topps company doesn t have a website for me to complain to but this did turn out to be a surefire way to find another hobby thanks
1,i have a three year old son he loves these take along toys we take them every where with us the tracks stay together very well we move them from room to room and never have to take them apart we have almost every part of the take along thomas the train items
1,only knowing jack canfield from the very successful chicken soup for the soul mega series i had no idea his abilities as a motivational mentor and coach although this book title seemed to be directed toward business success the gems of this book can be used in every aspect of your life this lengthy book is full of words of wisdom and wit lines that will move you to tears of discovery or move you to change directions a absolute must read book for understanding the real you
0,these shoes are no longer being made in italy but in india the quality of the material utilized and the construction is cheap and nothing like they used to be i have worn this same style of bostonian marco for several years and was completely satisfied this is a cheap imitation of what used to be a great comfortable well constructed shoe return to having them made in italy
1,i have played all the rpgs baldur s gate nwn dungeon siege final fantasy toee etc and i have to say that stumbling upon icewind dale was a real treat sure the graphics are dated but wow the storyline the dialogue the descriptions of the rooms and actions are all incredibly well written a breath of fresh air after playing ds the quests don t get in the way of the game like so many others that get bogged down in annoying side quests as a lame attempt to flesh out the world i would have prefered the game to be turn based like toee but this game s battles are numerous and really fun partially to good monster design compare bugbears in this game to nwn so much better and partially to the unforgettable situations and dungeons when pitted against other d d ruleset games the spell choices offered and levels they are given at is superior to all others i actually enjoyed having a druid in my party who could transform his arms into pythons and for the first time in crpg history actually used summon animals spells even if many spells were simular to other games these felt more tailored to the characters and made useful instead of waiting till higher levels to get one useful spell my favorite part is that i could handpick my team where as in baldur s gate i was forced to play with characters i didn t like or nwn where it was removed and tedious to interact with henchmen i enjoyed rping the characters backgrounds and interactions in my head and really enjoyed finding the treasure unique to like a wide variety of cut gems which became an addiction if you updated this game graphically to the level of toee and made it turn based with battle tactics it would be my all time favorite rpg
1,dude supy gave this game a bad review supy is likely years old with an advanced palette for video games it is best suited for children like my two children who are big fans of the lemony snicket movie the game follows the movie pretty closely the graphics are pretty good and if you re not a very skilled gamer like my year old it s okay because if you die you just restart the task i have a few technical complaints but this game definitely lives up to my star rating
1,i saw the original about times from this one is not much different just modestly i had been attempting to purchase this flick for years but was unable because the studio warner bros refused to release it under any format i was thrilled that it was finally released and have since been watching it with many friends most had no idea this movie was ever out i was particularly interested in anita palenburg she has really changed over the last years the content may be a bit provacative for most sex and violence but the quality are extraodinary for that era this one is a must for anyone
1,i bought this for my son recommended by his special ed teacher and the whole family has been using it ever since it s a nice sturdy trampoline and it s not too expensive the folding part is a little disappointing which i why it s not getting full stars however we haven t needed to use that feature so it wasn t that important to us overall this is a good quality trampoline for those who are looking for something less expensive
1,better beef jerky is not to be found anywhere shipping was good and it made alot of people happy at christmas time
1,my family and i are quite happy with this hammock it is comfortable and sturdy since it doesn t come with the hanging hardware future buyers make sure to order it from amazon at the same time hammock kit screws by american science surplus otherwise you might find yourself on a long search the only other place where we came across it was wal mart
1,we bought our performer about years ago from our local hardware store it was the best purchase we ever made its a beautiful thing to have a charcoal grill with a gas ignition about minutes you re ready to grill for the people who own a gas grill and are considering the performer but are concerned about dealing with charcoal its a piece of cake we had our reservations too and you re going to wish you switched sooner food never tasted so good

1,the stuff can seem somewhat pricy specially on a college budget but it s well worth it the taste isn t much to talk about you re better of just holding your nose and chugging it at once then again weightlifters don t eat supplements for taste do they i have a huge energy problem i lack it a lot between class and work i m usually drained at the end of the day but this stuff helps me get into the gym and hit it hard this isn t to say that it won t requre motivation on your part but it sure helps during the workout you may notice an increase in your pump my muscles felt so tight and big that i just wanted to lift more and more by the time i was done i went to the lockeroom to change and saw a monster in the mirror i ve had great pumps before but this was insane it didn t even look like me at all it felt great i ve been using it for months now and i don t train a day without it highly highly recommended

1,the necklace arrived quickly especially considering that it came from thailand good quality for a good price thanks for good service will be buying jewelry from this seller again
1,when it comes to using this for your children you d have to first know what your needs are i can t imagine it stopping any determined child without some reinforcing it would be more like a psychological barrier but depending on their temperament and age it may be good to deter them from getting to things they shouldn t have i ordered this to use for my puppy in my case i don t have the problem of her pushing on it so i can t say how long it would last through that for this price i was quite happy with the quality and it was amazingly simply to install
1,bueno esta quemadora dvd muy buena recomendable para los usuarios que quieran vivir una experiencia unica es la mejor que ha existido gracias amazon por vender productos de vanguardi
1,i just added this to my onkyo htib system and it s made all the difference in the world i m a bit of an audiophile on a reasonable budget with four subwoofers scattered throughout the rooms in my house and one polk in my truck i m most satisfied with the polk subwoofers for their tightness and ability to pound low frequencies without turning the sound into a boomy mess i listen to a lot of music with double bass drumming and thought that this would have a tough time keeping up with the quickness of the sub i like so much not the case what i get is very quick bass with that ground shaking impact that i always look for i m still going easy on er for the break in period but i can say that the trailer for kingdom of heaven included on the blu ray disc sounds absolutely stunning paired with my sony hdtv trips to the movie theater are few and far between these days now is a great time to pick up one of these since the price seems to have recently dropped by about throughout the web unbeatable sub for the money
1,i got this camera so i could have more control i m learning to use the shutter and aperture settings i haven t explored all the fancy settings much but there are tons of them i really like the continuous shooting option so i m more likely to catch a good action shot the wide angle lens has also allowed me to get some pretty cool shots and the macro settings work great for close ups i think it s one of the best buys you can find if you want to take some pretty cool photos but don t feel quite ready for an slr
1,not so many words to talk about this item but let me tell you that now i always use my rino turned on in my car baterie drain its no more cash pain good things comes with a led small light that turns on with diferent colors red green yellow so you could know if your rino its turned on or of or disconected large cable for a car you could use youre rino in the back seat even conected in the front of the car bad things just a bad ending quality it looks like a adapter of but i had owned it for more than a year and cero problems pvpaco gmail co
0,this stuff tastes great but after doing some research it s got a bunch of fats that are not considered healthy the first item on the list which means that it is the highest mass ingredient is partially hydrogenated oils if you have any problems with cholesterol i suggest talking to your doctor or maybe you might want to be like many americans and just increase your lipitor dosage so we can enjoy these tasty but potentially unhealthy creamers godspeed
1,i am not a horror movie fan in fact there are very few horror movies that have truly scared me but this one indeed made me literally crap myself i caught this movie during the midnight hours on ifc years ago and luckily the movie was just starting so i got to see it from beginning to end this movie is basically about a man named frank zito joe spinell who s a psychotic serial killer who seeks pleasure by killing women because he feels he s getting back at his abusive mother who was also a prostitute after her death frank feels alone but cannot forget the mistreatment he received from her all those years frank lives in a tiny apartment in new york city in which he keeps several mannequins he uses these mannequins by putting his victim s bloody scalps on it s heads when he spots a woman named anna caroline munro a photographer in the park taking pictures he gains a sudden interest in her but not the type of interest in which he wants to murder her but kind of a romantic interest he takes her out to dinner and buys her gifts but will he change his mind about her and make her become another one of his victims some of the scenes in this film are so incredibly gut wrenching especially the scene when he chases a nurse into a subway station and she hides in a bathroom stall i felt my heart pounding the whole entire time the effects were realistic nice job tom savini they don t come close to todays even though the movie was released in joe spinell plays this part so well that you might think he was for real and not only that but he physically looked the part too the scenes where he s in his apartment talking to his mannequins are some of the most creepiest scenes i have ever seen in a movie i believe that this film is one of the most realistic horror films out there because we get to see the results of how an alone mistreated child might turn out this isn t one of those lame zombie movies it s the real deal if you like horror and a lot of gore and you haven t seen this then i recommend you watching this
1,i am a prediabetic person this product helps keep my sugar under control my numbers are great after i eat this cereal
1,stick to singing in spanish shak
0,this movie was obviously made for young children and older people will noyt understand it
0,the razor isn t bad but the cleaning system is a joke mine wouldn t release the razor kept recleaning it plus and i am surprised that this isn t mentioned in the other reviews that i read before getting the razor the cleaning solution which is an expensive printer ink type of gimmick stinks like metal solvent bottom line is this would be a decent razor if it was sold by itself without the cleaning junk for a lower price
1,i love this blanket so much let me count the ways certified organic so hard to find large enough for a good tight swaddle for a good night sleep darling drawing showing how to swaddle baby sewn to blanket even my husband can now swaddle like a nurse soft soft and softer with every wash i just love this blanket and i feel so good wrapping my little bundle in the ultimate and i know he loves it too
1,this is a thin sheet but it fits my full size pack n play bassinet perfectly i would recommend getting of them because my son wets through it often
0,this product is absolutely useless save your money the first problem with this product is that the area that is supposed to fit over the buckle part of the car seat carrier simply does not fit over it in addition there s no way to attach it to the carrier stroller or whatever so when you try to put your child into wherever you wish to use it all it does is slide around so it s more hassle trying to use it every time than just dealing with the occasional blowout
0,yes she has a great voice but this entire cd is so overproduced so lifeless so very boring that i had to force myself to listen to the entire thing searching desperately for a track that measures up to the voice she sounds as bored as i was on every song i hope she wakes up soon before we all fall asleep
1,i bought this lens a little over a year ago for macro shooting i quickly found out however that to shoot macro only with this lens is a crime it is a very versitile lens its fast f aperture makes for good shooting in low light i pretty much use this outdoors as the with the crop factor of my rebel xt eliminates most indoor oppurtunities i frequently use this lens for family portraits the resultant photo is so crisp and clear and the bokeh really helps add snap to the primary subject as others have stated this is a heavy lens it doesn t have image stabilization is so a tripod or monopod is a great accessory to get the best images i use a beefy monopod for my best shots although i have a lot of handheld gems if you are tight for cash this isn t the one lens that does it all if you are looking for a versitile lens that can do outstanding macros and portraits this is that lens
1,i saw this back in when if first came out it was wonderful at first i thought it was going to be one of those historical tourist shows but it wasn t it could have been though mr wood is a very charismatic presenter but is what s better is that he took the story of the story of the trojan war from the pages of modern myth to reality i have read homer and i knew about schlieman but other than that i was ignorant of the trojan war mr wood started with what a regular person knew about the war and then took it into deeper level i was fascinated by the connection he made to the hittite empire the thought had never occurred to me that if a troy did exist it might have trade relations with empires to the east he also included experts in the fields of archeology modern history and history of the period i thouroughly enjoyed the dvd and have seen it several times i also have the alexander dvd and shakepeare in search of shakespeare was fun wood took the story of shakespeare down to the center of his human story i would recommend all the wood in search of programs if you can t find the films then read the books the books are just are entertaining
1,spike fett is mistaken the greatest moments he mentions is not for all time they were the top moments of the magazines lifetime which is only years this is one of the best film dvd magazines out there i highly reccomend it it has awesome articles reliable reviews and great color photos another thing i like about it is that its an british publication so you get a different opinion and point of view its a great magazine
0,if you ve read the book this movies is extremely loosely based on you will understand why the movie is so horrid it s beautiful to look at but that is all the sets and costumes are gorgeous but it looks more like a bunch of kids playing dress up than a film about a queen of france this movie completely ignores the revolution marie antoinette s arrest and murder in short the movie ignores anything that is not pretty girlish and light there is so much fluff and teen angst that it s hard to locate any fact in the film at all do we really need a close up of kristen dunst wistfully lazing about her apartments after she meets a handsome man even one scene like this is bad enough but it happens over and over we see kids at play more than adults with real problems and the actors and soundtrack only reinforce this feeling there is shopping food dress up and flirting but minus a handful of very short scenes no real account of the lives of the king and queen of france there was little in the way of dialog and sadly much of what there was was murmured while dunst flounced around in her pretty dresses there is so much historical inaccuracy in the film that it s almost pointless to try to listen to the dialog for instance the dauphin and brothers which we are told in the book the film is based on however in the film the brothers are combined into one very inaccurate character marie antoinette also had sons not one as the movie will tell you i don t mind some changes for the sake of drama but ignoring of a historical account and then insisting that your movie is factual is ridiculous the main actors are also terrible the supporting cast such as rip torn and marriane faithful is wonderful they only serve to make kirsten dunst look that much worse no one bother to act french or like the poised rulers in training that their character were the movie is so obviously a veichle for dunst that it s sickening there is just too much of her on the screen with not nearly enough reason for her to be there remember the minute scene i described where she does nothing but smile it keeps happening it gets very very old it feels more like a photo shoot for dunst than a film i usually like kirsten dunst but not in this film overall the film looks and feels more like a music video and should have been one there just isn t enough going on to warrent the film s length and it s really geared towards young girls who love pretty dresses food and shopping but have no taste for fact it s a chick flick at it s worst and it makes a mockery of the life of such an important person it s very hard to believe that this came from the same person who wrote and directed films like the virgin suicides and lost in translation
1,i grew up reading fangoria when i could sneak it past my parents that is fangoria magazine has a total respect for the genere of horror that comes shinning through with every article now you are not always going to agree with everything they say but you can always expect them to be honest when a horror icon is not performing up to snuff like stephen king or john carpenter they will be the first to point out the errors and flaws fangoria also has the chainsaw awards where you can mail in your vote for best horror movie actor ect and you can also submit a name for horror hall of fame my guy has yet to win it they also spot light horror films that would normaly fly under the radar of most people like the japanese and italian horrors wow they can make some splatter flicks and more independent films that wouldn t be showing at the mainstream theater and they have pictures all the blood and guts you can imagine in beautiful color though they have become more tame compared to what it was in the this is just a great magazine to have if your a horror fan i whole heartedly recomend it
0,i bought this camera after my year old broke my kodak i loved my even though it was only and didn t have a lot of the features the newer cameras have i figured that buying a newer kodak model and upgrading to would be a no brainer but i was disappointed in major areas first the lag time is so slow on the when i took pictures of my kids i rarely got what i was expecting to see the smile or look that i saw when the flash went was long gone by the time it captures we experimented with tons of settings and there was no difference the other disappointing area was low light picture quality anything i shot indoors was grainy except where the flash hit every background was grainy terrible using the low light settings fixed the problem but then your subject is blurry because you re not in sports or kids mode anymore which we used all the time with the for taking pics of the kids on my which is only now i could set it and forget it set it to action and it took perfect pics indoors or out moving or stationary that s what i thought i was getting in the but i was wrong i ended up returning the camera
1,this little motorcycle is cute however it s very lightweight and is similar in quality to a ride on toy that could be purchased for much less at any discount retailer the stickers do seem to be of high quality and to date none have peeled off the extreme shipping price added another to the price tag this is definately not a toy
0,i read the book and saw the movie which other than title and major characters have little in common i can t say i really liked either the book is a little funnier my major learning from the whole project was when who wants to be a millionaire taught me about roman a clefs of which devil is one perhaps if i had more interest in the fashion industry i d have been more fascinated by the inside look that devil provides meryl streep is very good as the apparently soulless miranda priestly editor in chief of runway magazine but somehow she s never quite devil enough anne hathaway is passable in her second or third made over princess role the minor characters including the wonderful tracie thoms as best friend lily are mostly wasted
1,about a month ago i decided to purchase my first game system since the origional nes i got the ds and i must say i love it somehow they have found an idea that seemed to only be a gimmick the dual screens and turn it into something new and fun so far i have bought new super mario brothers mario ds metroid prime hunters mario kart and a japan english dictionary program my main justification for buying it in the first place it is a great way to kill min or kill a few hours once you get used to using the stylus it becomes very natural pros fun games for all skill levels nice styling wireless connectivity multiple people can play the same game off of one card bright screen with good graphics nice sound long battery life cons it fits a little awkwardly in my hands you must buy a screen protector the stylus can scratch up the lower screen pretty badly in some games the stylus blocks your view of different sections of the screen the onyx black looks cool but it gets extremely smudged up with finger prints overall the cons are nothing compared with the pros i highly recommend it
1,the continuation of the game renews the fun for me with every expansion pack the smaller expansions in between the big ones ie glamour life stuff and or holiday mini pack are good in my book because i get tired of the same decor and clothing after a while it s nice to get fresh things although ea could just bundle those small expansions in with one of the bigger ones like nightlife or pets for examples regardless i still love the and i look forward to more enhancements in the future
0,i spent two days tried to have it formatted by my powerbook and set up a wireless network to replace my microsoft wireless router no luck it is on the shelf ever since people at the genius bar in local apple store may be able to help but it is too much troubel to set up other routers with a pc you can easily hire some one to set it up for you at your home for a couple of hundred dollars not apple if you don t have time don t buy this product
0,i had never eaten a luna bar before i made this purchase so i had expectations that were not even close to being fufilled when i read chocolate pecan pie i expected just that the taste of rich chocolate with nutty pecans and a gooey sugary base what i received was a bar with little taste nothing at all similar to the name on the bar in my opinion the bar is edible if you have no expectations of it the flavor is barely there the bar is dry it is never again be on my purchase list
1,this is truly the killer application for comic book collectors you get the comic s whole run from its auspicious origins in to its current incarnation at the end of in a tiny dvd that you can carry anywhere the thrill of reading classical issues in all their colored glory is not to be missed particularly for those not reprinted so far i especially enjoyed the impossible man and molecule man origin stories seeing how particular adventures ended is also great fun since i owned some comics from the generally undistinguished but didn t know how things turned out being able to read the entire john byrne run of the mid eighties was spectacular it s even better than his work at the x men and almost as cool as the lee kirby years this is so much better than the essentials since it s in color and so much cheaper plus it includes the original ads and letter pages it also beats the masterworks series not only on account of price but also because it has the original colors it s as good as owning the complete collection but it will take up less space and hence will generate less nagging from mothers or wives this is a must have item with perhaps the best price quality ratio i have ever seen can it be improved sure why not take advantage of the possibilities of computers and create an index of all characters that would allow the reader to see all appearances of a character over the years why not create an index of writers and artists so that one may quickly get a view of their work cross referencing is the next step the good people at marvel must be working on but there s no reason to wait for that even as it is this dvd is not just good enough it is great like the fantastic four themselves
1,i purchased this for my month old son who normally sleeps in a crib i was told that the daycare that he would be entering uses cots so in figuring this would also be good for travel i bought it my son loves it the whole thing is like a mesh beach chair i put it together in about seconds the removable fitted sheet that comes with it is soft the entire thing is easy to wipe clean it looks comfy it says it is good for kids up to and inches good to know my favorite feature is how tiny it folds up pretty light compared to other cots not nearly as bulky too nice royal blue colors
1,this magazine is published every month for me it s a big event i can t wait to finger though the pages look at the articles and read the columns from my favorite writers like molly ivans if you are a conservative this magazine is not for you but if you are a moderate or some where on the left you will love this magazine senator robert lafollette r wi originally founded it he ran for president in under the progressive party which has since died out he received popular votes and electoral votes it was one of the first publications ever to publish the writings of martian luther king and has since been a strong voice against the war in iraq this magazine should be cherished for being well progressive
0,this item came in the mail and my year old son and i were very excited i guess we should have read the description more carefully because i wasn t expecting so many tiny little pieces we used ticky tack and began the tedious process of sticking the different sized stars and such all over his room we waited that night to see the glowing celestial extravaganza we kept the light on for some time to charge the glow in the dark element then turned off the light what we found was nothing close to amazing the glow was fairly dim and only lasted for a very short period of time we even turned a blacklight on them and all that did was make them glow a little brighter but again the glow only lasted about minutes i ended up going back online and buying glow in the dark paint and a star shaped sponge we dabbed stars all over his ceiling these glowing stars last most of the night and our friends and family think his room is really cool
1,this video gives insight into the life and persona of picasso while it touches on his climb to fame recognition and success in the art world it focuses primarily on his personal relationships i love his work but i sure wouldn t have wanted to live with him the video had therapuetic effects for me i would assume it would for any viewer as it certainly calls into question your own view of relationships how they are and how they should and shouldn t be a winner all the way around
1,good actors great story some good action too this is great movie to help put together the bits and pieces of the stories you ve heard about wild bill hickok calamity jane and more it all may be true history it may be fictional it may just be myths mixed with fact but whatever the case there s more truth than not in this version of the

0,nsw or premiere is useless when it comes to vista and considering it comes pre packaged with every pc known to man desktop or laptop this is unforgiveable norton av has an update but that is a far cry from the price of systemworks that must be uninstalled according to ms vista maybe with the version truth be known system works has saved my azz a number of time since the version but now it is useless

1,this is such an good industrial album that i was sitting and listening to it and all the adjectives that i wanted to use seemed not good enough however if i have to put one then it has to be these brilliant astounding stupendous and awesome this is probably one of the best industrial albums of all time the first track is good and then it just gets better and better in fact the first track is not as good as the other ones and could have been replaced with another track the book let is ok but the lyrics are missing but still it is an important release since it showed that inudtrial bands are tallented muisicians and can sing minphaser life line guna are some of the best made industrial tracks ever with the intricate layers of sounds bets and samples the keyboard sounds are constantly amazing and this is an album not to be missed if one likes industrial music
1,besides baldur s gate ii icewide dale is the second most fun crpg game out there more action than role playing which is fine with me this is a single player multi character game and you get to create the entire party of adventures the plot is fairly weak but the action is plentiful and i love the fact that you get to develop different characters if you have to get just one of the icewind dale games get icewind dale ii the character generation and development is much better not to mention the gameplay and graphics

0,i thought these gummi bears tasted funny like there was perfume in them i have eaten other brands of gummi bears or gummi bear wannabes and these did not taste anything like those the flavors were not very distinct or fruity the texture was also very different and not very palatable i know that these are vegan gummi bears and do not contain gelatin and i assume that is why the texture is so different however i have eaten another brand sunny bears of gelatin free gummi bears and their texture was very different more like jelly candy i would buy the regular gummi bears but i am allergic to dyes and i can t find any that are dye free except these and the sunny bears after i wrote to amazon customer service about the product and explained to them that i could not stand to eat any more and wanted to return them they immediately refunded my money no questions asked even though the product is not eligible for return because it is a grocery item i was impressed

1,plugged the unit in a few weeks after i purchased it i was heading down to va for a reunuion hr trip set it up facing backwards so the kids could make use of the cup holders from the middle seats of the minivan the unit cooled quickly and kept the sodas cheese and veggies cool throughout the unit is quiet didn t really know it was running unless i had the engine off could be a little roomier but you can only do so much with the space between the front seats overall got what i paid for and the unit worked as advertised

1,if it wasn t hard everyone would do it hard s what makes it great manager jimmy duggan tom hanks of the rockrod peaches to his all world catcher dottie hinson geena davis in penny marshall s a league of their own i always think of that quote when i read these discussions of the great and sometimes the not so great philosophers in the amazon reviews on the one hand we have the professional philosophers ph d swho appreciate the difficulty of their craft on the other hand we have the almost were s undergraduates who cannot abide the effort it takes to decipher prose that seems unnecessarily dense and that is how it should be else everyone would do it and those of us with ph d s and tenure track jobs at good colleges and universities would be out of jobs and out of luck as for kant let s all be glad he s not on the job market
1,old spice classic is far and away the best deodorant i ve ever used it goes on clean unlike those powdery white deodorants it also has a great fragrance and longevity after application i think a lot of that is due to the high alcohol content if you look at the ingredients you ll see that alcohol is listed first in fact the container sports a flammable warning the alcohol really does work well to contain odor alcohol based deodorants are pretty hard to find so i m thankful this product is still being made
0,equilibrium is a curate s egg its best parts are not good throughout and its worst aspects make erratic appearances the acting is really the least of its problems the cardinal failure was a script that could not decide what kind of movie it wanted to be when it grew up equilibrium however poorly aspires to be a dystopian film and there exists a dystopian formula at work in fiction and film alike such a formula was employed magnificently in michael radford s adaptation of george orwell s contrarily films imperil themselves in discarding the formula as evidenced by alfonso cuaron s junky adaptation of p d james the children of men there are essentially three parts to this formula first there must be a depiction of a believable society and plausible justifications for its existence the author or script writer must paint vividly yet remain nuanced since at this stage his purpose is to show the reader or viewer without yet telling him the philosophy underlying it second two thirds of the way through there must be a conversation between protagonist and antagonist which formally unveils the ethical dilemma here the protagonist offers his alternative usually an acknowledgement of the humane third the dystopian resolution lies in the protagonist s choice he must surrender to the system rebel against it or be conquered by it the ending if it is not tragic in the classical sense must be ambiguous if it is ended happily it is no longer a matter for the reader or viewers thoughts the problem has been resolved and he may retire from it and become forgetful of it libria the society depicted in equilibrium is a post apocalyptic society wherein feeling has been criminalized under the pretext that human feelings and the actions carried out on their behalf represent the fons et origio of man s inhumanity to man the objective of outlawing sentiments is the preservation of peace is this believable ultimately it is not because the viewer is given no other reason for this society to exist no justification for its brutality except that it is by this method alone that peace may be preserved however a desire for peace is predicated on an aversion to war and aversion is something we principally feel a more believable premise would have been the prohibition of certain feelings but it is also unbelievable because it is inconsistent the protagonist john preston a member of the grammaton cleric an elite government agency for enforcing laws against so called sense crimes marries begets children hesitates in killing his partner what point would there be in any of this in a society that had eliminated feeling and if we are being generous and suppose that this was done intentionally so as to say you can never entirely eliminate feeling it fails still because if the denizens of libria weren t completely devoid of feeling they couldn t be as cowed as they are depicted instead countless times throughout the film characters make comments statements enquiries that can only have as their possible source or response an emotion to have had characters who were truly apathetic or for whom the fictitious drug prozium was effective they would have had more in common with star trek s borg the backdrop for this dystopia then lacks subtlety or nuance from the first fifteen seconds of film the viewer ethically objects it remains tediously manichean throughout the viewer is given a straw man and immediately begins tearing it down and the only suspense is literally in waiting for what we know will happen in brave new world it is mustapha mond s conversation with john the savage in it is o brien s talk with winston smith in the children of men it is a debate between theo and the xan in equilibrium the formal unveiling of the ethical dilemma happens in a haphazard way throughout culminating in a fight scene that lacks the awe inspired by the matrix three years before here was the moment for the talky bit of the film the sophisticated counter punch the moral awakening the vindication of the human instead the viewer is given another low brow hollywood denouement john preston does nothing to justify his alternative to the totalitarian status quo there is no bit of dialogue with father where lines are spoken which conveys the notion that feelings are essential to thought or that peace has been obtained at a terrible price all the loose ends littered liberally throughout the film are never addressed why have art in libria why does father intonate and raise the pitch of his voice to manipulate the masses in a scene reminiscent of a leni riefenstahl propaganda film a better film would have acknowledged these scenes and defended their inclusion in a climatic dialogue between john preston and father or dupont as it turns out the conclusion of equilibrium can be summarized as follows good guy kills bad guys sixty second revolution ensues people can feel again hero smiles time to go to bed there wasn t ever a genuine ethical dilemma anyway what was wrong was obviously wrong and what was right was intuitively right the viewer never believed the reasons libria came to be or at least they never found them plausible in the way they found huxley s orwell s james zamyatin s or koestler s explanations in equilibrium it was all simply the soft groundwork prepared for the banal unoriginal action movie to follow the plot then was in some respects as shallow as the tendentious storylines in soft core porn films they needn t be sensical because no one is interested in the story but rather for the titillation arousal and amusement many viewers of equilibrium are fans of flashy action sequences a majority of whom were not disappointed as their reviews attest but for those seeking a fuller cinematic experience equilibrium is an unfortunate disappointment during the film a woman asks preston why are you alive preston responds with the bureaucratically sterile answer i m alive to safeguard the continuity of this great society to serve libria it s circular you exist to continue your existence what s the point she asks and what s the point is exactly the point about this film
1,i was looking at the bigger cargo boxes but everything seems so big and heavy i need a cargo box that i can put up alone on top the acura mdx just the right size the box was easy to assemble less than an hour it is also easy to attach to the vehicle the box looks like the more expensive boxes on top of my vehicle and color matches well with my silver mdx i just wish the plastic was a little thicker but i think it will hold up well the box is sturdy after assembling i
1,i am now on my second round of herb kits and for this batch i purchased three kits and mixed the pods to make my fall winter mix cilantro basil parsely thyme savory sage and oregano the basil thyme savory and oregano are from the new italian herb kit everything i ve planted either sprouted a day early or right on time the savory appears to be the most delicate of the bunch but it has grown the tallest in the three weeks since i started the basil is the first to sprout the parsely seems to be slow but steady your herbs will be good for at least six months with proper care i m sure you could extend their life these are very easy to care for and it s great to always have fresh herbs at your disposal i recommed this product to anyone who loves fresh herbs and or anyone who has had problems growing herbs in the past
0,i will not recommend this product i use it in my car and most of the time is wrong if you really need a compass you better read all reviews i usually do it but i couldn t find about this product and well lucky it was only a few dollars
1,one of my all time favorite movies great story great acting great casting directing superb i cry everytime i watch it
1,being quite the fan of grace slick jefferson airplane and other groups i bought this album only having heard two songs on it daydream nightmare and outlaw blues at first i was a little puzzled the great society sounded different than any band i d ever heard before after listening to it about two more times i realized this uniqueness was a good thing they sound a little rougher than your average band and they were grace her first husband and her brother in law assembled this band out of a few of their friends and it only was around for about a year the great society definitely isn t a band for everyone but if you love interesting sounding music want to hear some of the earlier forms of psychedelic rock or are just curious about how grace slick sounded before the smoother recordings of jefferson airplane this is the band for you a quick review of all the songs sally go round the roses a great way to open this cd pay special attention to the instrumental break in the middle it s amazing any time this group does an instrumental solo it will be very good didn t think so in my opinion one of the weaker songs on this album but a fine song just the same grimly forming an overall fantastic song to listen to with intriguing lyrics and another great instrumental section i love the tambourine it adds an interesting air to the song somebody to love yes here it is the original version of the jefferson airplane hit written by darby slick grace s brother in law this has a much less psychedelic sound than the ja version but they re both equally as good father bruce this is a very catchy song written about lenny bruce as if he were a preacher fun to sing along with outlaw blues this is a cover of a bob dylan song i think grace s voice on this is incredible often as i may another fun song that s almost as catchy as father bruce arbitration this song is mostly some great instrumentals but features some singing from david minor he did rhythm guitar i believe white rabbit yup another original version of a ja song this song s about because there are minutes of great guitar sax playing at the beginning almost better than the ja version that s how it is a cheery song with fun words you ll definitely be singing this one aftewards darkly smiling this is another weak link on the cd there aren t many thankfully it does have some interesting lyrics though nature boy grace s singing recorder playing make this song memorable you can t cry this is a fun rock song with the usual great guitar playing from darby slick daydream nightmare this is one of the more psychedelic and dark songs on the album with great bass and guitar playing and more of grace s recorder this is definitely not a song to skip over everybody knows also a fun rock song and yes another catchy one born to be burned this song is a little less exceptional but it does have a good bass line and some good guitar father a fantastic way to end the album this song is a nearly seven minute long instrumental that builds up to an amazingly frantic crescendo not a song that will keep you bored
1,i was totally amazed when i first tried this coffee if you like a dark roast with a full but mellow flavor you will love this coffee no hint of bitterness or overroasting it s just the best
1,i think this is a great film many critics and a few reviewers always complain about it s running time minutes insisting it s too slow almost all of clint s films the ones he s directed run long the running times range from just over hours to just under hours the longest being bird at hours minutes sure the film isn t pc but it was made in when you didn t have to be pc but there is one thing that almost everyone agrees on the mountain climbing scenes at the end of the film these are nervewracking and incredibly authentic clint did all his own stunts in these sequences and many professional rock climbers and mountaineers have praised these sequences and they are very intense to watch because you know the actors are really up there no cgi in those days this is one of the reasons they work so well cgi looks fake anyway it makes movies seem like cartoons people know it isn t real cgi reliance should be reduced in hollywood as it takes the tension out of action scenes check this film out it s worth all of its minutes
0,i kid you not this suite program resource thug is the worst garbage on the market like others i read the shiny reviews and took a chance and purchasing it because of the frequent trips to hell i had logged in with other so called security suites over the years works ok for about the first month or so and then whammmm crash city think i m joking buy it and find out for yourself i m no pro yet but i do have enough knowledge about programming to know when my pc goes from normal to choke out of the clear blue uinstalled it just to make sure that it was the cause of the problem sure enough it was other reviewers mentioned thier processor being pulled to the grind well it s true stay away stay far far away
1,solas previous cd words that remain is a classic in irish traditional music and the loss of karan casey certainly affects their sound on this album however instrumentally they are incredibly strong and as inventive as ever and deirdre scanlon is a gifted singer with a wide range of styles i don t think the choice of tracks is quite so strong but it is a powerful performance of a very high order of music the instrumental playing at times leaves you breathless and the energy levels are very high there are some lovely songs i like bonnie mae and miner s life in particular and i will remember you is an original gem i am disappointed to hear critics complain of the lack of traditional music on the cd and about the use of rock instruments based on those criteria the only instruments tolerated would be harp uillean pipes wooden flute and fiddle tin whistle flageolet guitar mandolin bouzouki accordion and banjo being modern foreign invaders and what a pity what defines traditional is it pre planxty can no more traditional songs be written seamus egan and co have done their apprenticeship in the rigorous disciplines from the book of traditional music rhythm and melody and have enriched it with a new chapter in general i agree that bass and percussion is often unnecessary but in this case the augmentations are tasteful and generally effective i would also highly revcommend liz carroll s lost in the loop although if you re a purist it has the solas rhythm section playing on it and features many of liz s brand new traditional tunes brilliant
0,this item sounded great in the ad but the only thing right in the ad is that it s pocket sized no one can understand what i say through it when the volume is turned up the sound becomes fuzzy and incoherent i thought this would be a great device but no one can understand me feet away much less if you order this device save the box it came in so you can send it back and get a refund warning the shipping is non refundable

1,the keyring is very nice i had no idea just how light titanium is the caps screw on and while the engineering and tolerances are quite tight it s easy to see the caps coming unscrewed making the ring kinda useless definately advised to crank the caps on very tightly after putting your keys on it additinally the metal is quite plyable and i ve had to stop myself many times from bending the ring while fidgiting with my keys
0,two months the amount of time in which i saved to purchase what i thought was an megapixel camera for a steal one week to find that no matter what i tried i was utterly dissapointed no matter the setting every picture is drowned out by the flash and withouth the flash the picture is nothing more than i horrible blur the minute time flash is horrible every person i try to get a picture of thinks it has taken the picture before the final flash even goes off resulting in horrible family photos i could go on but i wont i cant even stress my dissapointment in my waste of money there is a reason that it is not the bestselling camera on amazon because it is not worth it i now have to save up for another and hopefully pawn this off on someone with less expectancy in a camera
0,this pad works basically but it does turn itself after minutes there s no way to prevent that this may be fine for some uses but it s very inconvenient for others
0,before buying ddr i read everyone s reviews and thought that after all of the bad reviews i might still like it this product really fools you this is why if you ve seen regular ddr you know what the pad looks like well the dance pad and the box looks normal untill you turn it on it says songs right well it s not really different songs about of these songs are a trick they combine songs and make it into one track the graphics are horrible a screen looks like pieces of moving clip art stationed around the middle of the screen where the arrows are i wouldn t reccommend buying this at all
1,i love the feel of a good writing instrument and own several mont blancs and other fine pens the waterman was an outstanding addition to my collection and is one of the pens i use often it is comfortable in the hand has an elegant design and writes wonderfully
1,piglia muestra que es un explorador de nuevas formas narrativas pero la lectura de este libro y de otros suyos nos deja ver a un autor que no se deja leer con facilidad que es críptico debe ser leido con mucha atención con papel y lapiz en la mano para seguir sus tramas y personajes y eso no es un virtud en un escritor
0,i would not recommend these hats you definately get what you pay for the sizes are not true to fit and they are cheaply constructed even for a hat i basically threw it out the sad thing is i spent as much in shipping as i did on the product
0,my husband and i just bought the family feud edition dvd tv games i have to say we both loved this game when it was first on and on gsn as repeats and i like the computer version we played this once by ourself and a couple of times with friends and we all have found that this game was boring as someone said they can t believe they put this out if you are going to get this game then buy the computer version you have rounds round round double money round triple money round fast money round you have team a and team b if you get one wrong answer and you click wrong then it says go for steal however you only get one x per guide if an answer is revealed that team a did not have written down they press wrong answer button and pass the remote to team b team b now has the opportunity to steal the round so most of the game was passing the remote back and forth if the steal answer matches any one of the remaining answers they steal the round even if you team a had that written down and takes the money for any answer the other team has answered correctly even if they got out of and both teams say have the same answer the game itself was simple and basic there was no real fun to it we tried to play it with others and they said afterwards that they found it boring and not all that fun one person said they would have more fun watching the game itself on tv over playing this version of the game you get two markers red and blue to write on the two wipe clean score cards the negative on this is that the markers do not write all that good on these cards even though they were meant to another thing is that the same game will come up more than once we had the same question and answer come up even though we only played twice this is the or dvd game we have been given or bought this is the only one where we disliked it so much after playing it a couple of times that we are giving it away as we will not be playing it again
1,as an asthmatic with a sulfa allergy i thought i was limited to naturally dried fruits which are tasty but not aesthetically appealing i d been looking for some way of getting my fix for dried fruit without running the risk of at worst a trip to the emergency room i d found a number of other freeze dried fruits but most of them had sugar added something i try to avoid i ordered this product orchard blend with the hope that it would be flavorful wow was it aside from being good as a quick snack for when my blood sugar starts to drop it s also fantastic when mixed with plain oatmeal to give it a little something more i m extremely pleased with this product and i would recommend it to anyone that has been avoiding dried fruits because of a sulfa sensitivity or allergy
1,i use fountain pens everyday so i know what i am talking about this is a great fountain pen for everyday writing one that you will not care gets lost or damaged due to its very low price unlike the average non limited edition fountain pens which can cost over and sometimes much more the pilot varsity pen lays down a great fine to medium line of ink and the nib ie the writing tip does not dry out too fast when left uncapped and the pen seems to write forever with its large internal ink reservoir fantastic buy and with no muss n fuss of having to refill the pen either

0,i have bought two of these toys for my son an only child and pretty gentle on toys it has been kept in his bedroom away from his playgroup he has not even played with it regularly yet both times these toys broke within months of purchase yes it is fascinating and like other reviewers i ve also had some fun with it myself but i am disgusted that it broke down so easily twice there must be a reason that amazon doesn t offer new ones for sale please think hard about buying a new one elsewhere unless you don t mind looking at the you ll pay as a month or two of entertainment look to other gear toys that don t depend upon this lousy motor
1,we bought this set for my seven year old boy and we were a bit dissapointed there are better magic kits out there for the price for older children look at the marshal broden kits by cadaco if you have a young child is is four and five though this is a great set the tricks are easy to work and they are big for small hands anyone who has any magic sets or tricks though will find this too simplistic and not as exciting as many of the other kits

1,dominions is a fantastic leap into tbs on an epic scale huge gods battling for supremacy by any means possible genocide reckless magic and disregard for humanity to be the last god of the panthenon a steep learning curve especially for perfectionists it provides you with a simulation of fantasty combat as opposed to actual historical combat low end graphics are balanced with the fact there are so many of them along with additional abilities a must for those who love and tbs games not for everyone and documentation that does not do the game justice it is hard to get into but if you can get past the i m losing and i don t know why feeling you will be well worth it
0,i have liked other hot pockets like the ham and cheese is not bad if you spread some mustard on them but i think they over spiced the pizza hot pockets they taste kind of strong and weird
1,we have been using meyenberg s powdered goat milk for several years we used to buy their milk in cartons at walmart and it was good the only problem was that we live so far from a walmart store that we would run out of goat s milk between trips we decided to try the powdered and found that it mixes and stays mixed very well and tastes exactly like the liquid milk in the cartons of course it stores easily and indefinitely and we highly recommend it to anyone who wants or has to drink goats milk
0,i have ordered intimo silk boxers in the past and have been happy with that purchase so far the fabric in these cotton boxers is extremely stiff and they have not gotten any softer even after washings i will continue to wash these in hopes that the fabric will soften enough to be comfortable enough to be worn i now know why i pay for two pair of jockey s
1,this is an excellent film a lot of the topics that were discussed in this film still happen at hbcu s as a matter of fact the issue of lightskinned vs darkskinned is still going on today on a college campus or not spike lee to me is one of the best film directors of all time he is not afraid to tackle issues that are in the african american community i highly recommend this film if you haven t seen it get the dvd it s a classic
0,i read the reviews for this and decided despite some negative comments to give it a try since it was so cheap at first i was impressed with this shade because it attached quite easily to my stroller and actually provided shade to my baby although not as much as it looks like it would his legs were never protected from the sun even though it looked liked they would be because the shade is so big my stroller is a pretty typical stroller nothing special or comlpicated about it but yes it did flip up in the wind or even a small breeze very easily and i had to weigh it down which didn t really work because it is so flimsy after about weeks it lost its shape completely and the front of it flipped up and no longer provided coverage at all piece of junk

1,i have had two kids use my evenflo carseat i hated it it was like they never even tried it out to see how well its features worked i finally got so sick of it when my child was months old that i ordered a babytrend flexloc at first i was seduced by the high safety ratings but even after that consumer reports article was rescinded i still liked a lot of the features pros very comfy seat good padding the canopy is twice as long as my evenflo so it can cover baby almost completely the canopy stays in place it doesn t fall forward or backward behind the seat the tightening mechanism under the baby s feet is easy to reach and very easy to adjust to make the straps tighter or looser depending on what baby is wearing the harness mechanism is very easy to adjust the shoulder strap height my evenflo had to be rethreaded every few months and even my mechanically inclined husband said it was horrible the flexloc is just a dial on the back that you turn it s a breeze the seat can be transfered between cars without the base it can be strapped directly to the car by using a seat belt on the car seat or by using the latch system if your car has it the triangular handle has a nice grip and is easy to hold in any position this carseat is lighter than my evenflo the cloth is very wipeable not as absorbant of spills and stains as my evenflo cons i found a few minor cons that definitely would not deter me from buying this carseat and one that might depending on how i can resolve it once i contact babytrend the release button to take the seat off its base is at the toes under the seat it s a little harder to reach than the ones behind the head if the carseat is backward facing as others have said the buttons to move the handle are a bit stiff but not horribly so i was prepared for them to be way worse the handle is thinner and doesn t feel as sturdy as my evenflo when carrying baby around but it hasn t had any problems this is the one big one that i have to check with babytrend on twice when i have turned a corner sharply the carseat has tipped to a degree angle i have tightened down the seatbelt as much as i could putting my full weight on it and using the seatbelt retracting mechanism but maybe i m still not doing it right the base is narrower than my evenflo s was so maybe that s why so i need to contact babytrend and see if they have any suggestions until then i guess i ll take the corners slower overall i have felt like this seat was a major improvement over my evenflo and even over the graco snugrides i checked out at the store it was intelligently designed to be easy to use and adjust as baby grows i would recommend it for sure just make sure you strap it in tightly or use the latch system if you have it
1,let me start by saying that i love this movie and love fulci this was the first fulci flick i seen and when i first watched it i thought it was a little overrated it was only after i watched the majority of his other movies that i really learned to appreciate it let me explain this was the one of his movies that failed to shock me when i watched the regurgitation of giblets scene from city i was shocked when i watched the nipple scene in ripper i was shocked watching this again i realize its probably the best done of all his movies but definetely not his goriest and the story isnt really the greatest im sorry the only reason i write this review is probably because the poor reviews of the two other two movies ive mentioned which honestly i enjoyed more zombie is a great movie but nowhere near his best or goriest isnt that why we watch fulci flicks
0,sure i like a mystery who doesn t but when you a read a magazine like hitchcock you end up losing faith in the short mystery story the tales are hard edged and lacking in style and substance we seem to have a wealth of mystery writing talent but time and again hitchcock magazine is a disappointment the value for money is horrible the magazine is printed on newsprint paper and the ink just needs to be touched to smudge alfred hitchcock would not be proud
1,i was very eager to get this title on import knowing that it was somewhat unique in terms of it s genre label yes it has rpg elements but it s something quite separate i only wish there were more such games on the or any format for that matter this is storytelling videogame style at it s best capcom clover have produced a real gem it s an experience like zelda a highly enjoyable slice of fantasy that is sure to hold you in it s thrall for some hours or more a visual treat and beautiful soundtrack also if you consider yourself a gamer then get this it s destined for cult status in a word superb

1,our local macy s recently offered free skin typing and the samples to go with it i really only went to pick up a free moisturizer as i ve found with some judicious sampling you don t have to pay for that item instead i fell in love with this soap and got free moisturizer too hooray when the sales rep first handed me the bar soap i balked i ve known people who ve used clinique but just the idea of washing my face with bar soap freaked me out they do offer a liquid version but the rep told me the soap was a better exfoliant i can t say for sure if that s so but i can say this really is a great face wash i was addicted after one use and since it is a bar of soap you ll get a really great sudsy foam it has a mild pleasant scent and it washes off easily i have the mild version and i just love it my skin feels clean but never tight and not only does it not cause breakouts it immediately calmed the one i had i ll definitely be buying more i do want to add however it is drying in the wintertime if you have normal skin and i had to switch to a cream cleanser it may not be a problem for oily skin for dry skin i d really avoid it in the winter at least you still ideally need a makeup remover before the soap i also became a recent convert to clinique s rinse off foaming cleanser but even if you don t want to use that product remember that removing your makeup is a separate step
1,the shipment was fast also the email response before the vhs was in very good shape almost like new as said in the description
0,this dvd was a waste of money and a waste of time it s unauthorized by muse so therefore there were no interviews no live footage and none of their music was included they interviewed people who had never even met the band i learned nothing new from watching it don t waste your money
1,this product is great it is a little hard to turn when both kids are in it but i found if you hold it on the outside of the cup holders instead of on the hand grips turning is easier makes my life a lot easier with my and year old
0,i had not realized what great performers michael flatley colin dunne and jean butler were until i watched this version of riverdance the lead dancers in this version are not in the same league and much of the performance is sloppy compared to previous versions what made riverdance great for me was the precision timing and dancers dancing togeather in the irish dance numbers it is all gone here try riverdance live from new york city or the video tape riverdance the show instead this version should not have been released
1,if you want a cell phone that is well made looks good feels good to use and is a really good phone as opposed to a phone and a bunch of other things the is an excellent choice it has enough features to keep things interesting but is easy to use and above all is a really good phone that does not sacrifice call quality or battery life to a bunch of useless features that i don t want it also looks and feels good and is thus a pleasure to use
1,l occitane s lavender harvest matte face lotion really works to mattify oil and makes a nice makeup primer i don t have oily skin but tried some samples over a night serum i was using with avocado oil to mattify it so my face wouldn t be greasy on my pillow it left my skin feeling satiny and smooth avocado is one of the heavier thicker oils and did wonders for my dry skin but i hated the feel of it so finding this was a real bonus to fix that problem lavender oil also has relaxing aromatherapeutic properties is a natural antiseptic which helps prevent blemishes and mosquitoes don t like it so if you have oily skin and live in a humid climate in the summer you should try this note i have had good luck shopping with l occitane through amazon but called first to make sure what i was ordering was in stock on their website
0,about two years ago vanity fair was not only the best magazine of the year but maybe all time i would read it from cover to cover now sadly it is a bunch of fluff the quality has really gone downhill i am going to let my subscription run out i really miss the old days
1,unless you were a wealthy chocoholic you would probably never blow the on these as a gift however this is a great box there is a similar all heart shaped box for valentines which is cool if you dig hearts it fits all the qualities i look for in a gift its extravagant its something the person i give it to will love and its something they wouldn t get themselves i tried of these the mixed berry is ridiculously good the peanut butter and jelly was interesting everything is superb quality wise i knock it down a bit on price but honestly its tough to find fault in this product it much much better than regular godiva which i find to be super sweet and overpriced

0,they suck bad writing and jokes that rely on gimmicks and previously established chapelle humor it was like watching mind of mencia two thumbs down leave this one alone tupac playing in the club was pretty funny though
1,i just want to put it out there audra mcdonald is an absolute genious everything she touches turns to gold and i just want to smack some of you for saying that she failed in her attempt to make a great record this may not be the audra that we are used to but if you listen closely she s near by so this cd is a little less difficult vocally so what my favorite quality of ms mcdonald s is that she is emotionally connected to whatever she is singing she could record twinkle twinkle little star and i would want to listen to it over and over again because she tells a story so if you buy this cd listen to it more than once let it grow on you let audra do her thang children let her do her thang
1,this is a fun toy just a bit difficult to stack because of the narrow wheels you can ask which one is biggest what color is this car ask about the numbers on the cars etc that is why i think it is educational to that respect my son still has this and is three years old and will play with it every once in awhile with his matchbox cars stacking them or just rolling them along
1,we had to move it about our place in a few different windows before we found one that actually got the radio waves and we know our directionals here so if you get it just be patient and leave it overnight in a few different places before you give up
1,excellent presentation and goes into detail much of which may be unknown to the viewer one minor criticism the participants let stanley lord of the californian off much too easily
0,clearly this movie was never intended as high art or even a zombie gore fest although hyped as such so it s probably a bit unfair and easy to take shots at it however i think it fails on it own terms many spoilers to follow stop here if you plan to view the entire film the premise a group of stupid eco terrorists raid a research facility in london even though warned by a researcher release some highly agitated but otherwise normal looking chimps who then attack and infect them with a fast acting within seconds virus that transforms them into insane red eyed murderous really fast creatures who attack and infect other normal humans through bites and even scratches one drop of their saliva or blood can infect you the plague is let lose the hero cut to a skinny kid of about pounds with a dopey beard laying naked on a hospital bed it s days later and he wakes up but no one s there he then wanders around an empty london in hospital scrubs looking confused yelling hello hello there are no bodies outside and nothing that looks like the remains of one there are almost million people in metropolitan london where did they go i asked myself the supporting cast he then wanders into a church and finds it full of what looks like sleeping people he yells hello at which time some start screaming and rush at him in the close up it s clear they have turned and he slugs the creature priest thing with his bag of coke cans he gets out more stuff happens eventually he meets smart and tough selena naomie harris armed with a matchete and mark noah huntley armed with a steel bar who have avoided infection and explain the situation to the dim whitted hero who turns out to be a bicycle messager boy who lives with mum and dad seems the creatures come out mostly at night mostly hero insists on going home mark selena tag along we find his very middle class mum dad peacefully dead in bed from an overdose of booze and pills guess they could not live in a world without telly more talk and moaning and tears from hero who very unwisely lights a candle at night which naturally draws an attack by some nasties more fighting bad guys are killed by selena and mark while hero cowers on floor mark gets infected denies it but is chopped by selena who can see it in his eyes damm girl if i m ever in a zombie movie i want you along day comes the pair then wander aimlessly though london chatting away about everything but how to deal with the threat and survival and at this point i start thinking wouldn t it be a good idea to get some guns preferably full auto with a lot of ammo i mean although the creatures are fast they are stupid don t run in packs and make a lot of noise and can be killed and stay dead police stations and military bases are all over london probably deserted and filled with guns but this doesn t seem to occur to our wandering charactors who trust to a baseball bat machette which you must get close to use emmmm i start squirming a bit in the seat and for the first time look at my watch but it s still kind of ok so far it s still a tight well made interesting film with the bloody action well filmed and important to the story line and mostly believeable in it s own low buget post apocolypitcal setting with taut dialoge that holds my interest maybe there a reason the hero is cast as stupid or will he grow and learn through experience maybe but it better be soon because we are almost minitues into the film and it s getting real hard to identify with him or care the suporting cast night falls our pair see flashing lights on the top of a high rise much action ensues they find more survivors just a average working type dad taxi driver and his young daughter more talk seems they are out of water and there is a radio broadcast giving direction to go north where the army who usually have guns has set up a secure area works for me after some debate on whether it better to stay where they are isolated in fact trapped on top of a building with no water or power or food or real weapons until overrun by zombies or travel north to safety in daylight and safety remember the monsters don t operate in daylight this group of dopes reluctantaly decide to go north in a taxi with no guns remember rule of zombie films gun are good and at this point in time this heretofore good film starts to move rapidly downhill in believablity the journey of the dumb piling into dad s hack loaded with junk as if going on a brighton holiday with all even tough selena giggling and laughing off they go when faced with the choice of driving through a dark tunnel where it is obvious that they could be trapped and killed or another safer route they naturally chose the tunnel stuff happens stopping to get gas the hero wanders alone into a dark confined space for no real reason armed only with a baseball bat more stuff happens stopping for the night they decide that a picturesque open field with a few low stones is a great spot and preceed to you guessed it start a really big fire and go to sleep with no one on guard i m not making this up folks nothing happens however they do get to see a family of white and black horses running free and it s clear that we are no longer watching a horror action film with some internal logic but a trite message film they reach the army blockade but no one is there in spite of dead everywhere they proceed to split up and wander around this perfect ambush site for a look see more stuff happens after this the stupid illogical stuff comes fast so this is a good stopping point at the end we learn from the crazy and sadistic army major aren t they all though that the goon s can t farm or feed and will likely starve because of it think about that one we also learn that the virus is contact borne not airborne think hard about that one dudes since it started in one local it s very unlikly to have spread thoughout england in days big plot holes dumb ending pound stupid hero becomes arnold the terminator in mintues girls decide it s far better to die a gruesom death then put out and lose their honor to what looks like a bunch of boy scouts in cammos who are their only protection really dumb stuff after an excellent start sad this was a really superior film for the first mintues

0,i bought this book before my first trip to austria i had a sinking feeling while reading it that it was mostly a pastiche of unusable generalizations that turned out to be true what shall we do with a paragraph that tells us that austrian women are strong minded and independent and organize their homelife well although many go to work this book might have some value for a person who had never left their english speaking homeland before and needed to be warned that people are sometimes naked in the sauna or at the beach it also provides some amusing anecdotes about language especially viennese and useful info about festivals mostly though this book was good for reading aloud to austrian friends i would quote it as an iron clad authority when their behavior didn t quite match the book s version and thereby amused them tremendously lynn hoffman author of the new short course in wine and the forthcoming novel bang bang from kunati books isbn
0,the second cd was scratched and hence i cannot play it i would appreciate it if you would send me another one and also include the information needed to return the damaged one sent to me thanks jeann

1,attractive wood finish as seen in the picture it was fairly easy to put together keeps the golf stuff neat and organized
1,i was in the travel industry for years and found cn to be an excellent albeit brief source of continually updated information on destinations and all other aspects of travel whether upscale or backpack yes it is not encyclopaedic and yes it is chock full of adverts however the latter brings the cost of publication no doubt and the former allows cn to cover a wide array of topics in each issue their travel product ratings are next to none and shortlists the selection process allowing the consumer to make more intelligent and cost conscious purchasing decisions
1,i bought this seat because we have a small eating area in our kitchen too small for a full size high chair the seat has worked wonderfully from age months to now age months i do find the seat hard to recline or sit up but i have only had to do that a handful of times as once you find the right setting for your child it stays there until he she is ready for the next setting the cloth lining is very easy to remove wash and put back and the plastic under the seat cover is easy to wipe clean the tray is easy to put on remove and again wipe clean or wash off in the sink i have also found the seat easy to take on and off the dining chair when i need the chair for entertaining others my daughter has never complained about sitting in the seat and now that we are no longer using the tray but still using the seat as a booster enjoys having her own place at the table i highly recommend this seat for parents looking to conserve space in their dining areas but not sacrifice convenience or comfort
0,i found the performance of these michelin tires to be adequate there doesn t seem to be too much in the way of rolling resistance and they grip the road well the road seems to have eaten these tires up i have less than miles on it and the tires are full of holes that may say something about the quality of roads out here in hawaii i m getting a flat every time i ride my next tire will be something a little sturdier
0,i love this swing because it goes side to side she can sit when awake lay down when asleep and once you put her in she is out cold after weeks of using it i thought the battery was going but when i changed the battery the music was still slow and i still had to keep the swinging motion on high two weeks later it just stopped working i ve only had it for two months and hardly use it just a total of hours a day give or take a few
0,everything works fine except for two flaws in excel on the numpad the minus key actually toggles shift and the slash key acts as the alt key this is unacceptable i had a logitech keyboard also with all sorts of annoying little flaws which surfaced when playing games logitech has some great ideas and sleek looking products but they are plagued with small yet crucial technical shortcomings i will never buy logitech again
1,my year old daughter and our year old neighbors love this toy i had it up during my daughter s second birthday party and all the kids loved it it holds up very well and i have only had to refill it once and that was only because one of the kids managed to pull out the plug some of the balls are not inflated but they still roll just fine and my daughter has the best time with this it is up in the living room and not outside so that keeps it from getting any other holes i would recommend this for any kids around or under the one thing to keep in mind the kids may be afraid of it at first my daughter was terrified of it the first day but by the second she loved it and now she spends a lot of time in there
0,i have two of these head sets one never keeps its charge pretty much from the time i bought it the other seems to charge alright the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime the sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound and ask me to switch to a wired mic also it s big and heavy compared to the motorola i own i highly recomend the motorola sorry i dont know the model number off hand
0,quite disappointing if you are expecting a film true to the book hopefully they will remake the movie soon because the technical capabilities back in did not do the novel any justice
0,there are bad movies and then there are bad movies universal soldier the return is a cosmically bad movie a movie so poor in every aspect of its execution that one would have to look to manos the hands of fate for comparison the first universal soldier film was a moderately entertaining shoot em up flick starring action stars jean claude van damme and rocky refugee dolph lundgren that essentially accomplished what it set out to do people perished in violent ways stuff exploded and van damme and lundgren beat each other into bloody pulps at the end of the film even the presence of the charming ally walker as van damme s female sidekick greatly helped the film the movie garnered enough attention and fans to merit the release of a special edition dvd some time back it unfortunately also garnered enough attention and fans to merit this unredeemable piece of trash sequel the second and one hopes final installment in a franchise that should never have become a franchise achieves such heights of utter banality and stupidity that i sat in open mouthed awe watching it i think i can safely say i am less of a person for having sat through this atrocity expect to spend a few days in a coma after the credits roll van damme returns as luc the reanimated soldier who triumphed over the forces of government sponsored evil in the first film on this outing he now works for dr dylan cotner xander berkeley a scientist who reconstituted the universal soldier program with the help of his supercomputer s e t h luc with his female sidekick maggie kiana tom helps design and run training missions for a new batch of super soldiers the film opens with what the filmmakers hope is a pulse pounding jaunt up a river a jaunt filled with explosions stunts gunfire and the briefest glimpse of tom s incredibly fit form as the mission grinds to a halt we learn several important things kiana tom is incredibly hot but can t act her way out of a paper bag luc has a daughter named hillary karis paige bryant who you just know will get into trouble at some point and the only soldiers we must pay attention to are romeo bill goldberg and the one played by michael jai white frankly turning off the film immediately after glimpsing tom s amazing physique is probably a good thing everything that follows is dull predictable and so full of plot holes as to defy description universal soldier the return feels like eighty minutes of dental surgery rather than an action film sure enough cotner s computer goes on the fritz and unleashes the killing power of the universal soldiers in the resulting conflagration s e t h implants its consciousness in michael jai white luc and his loved ones flee from the compound and the military swoops in to contain the problem an extraordinarily untalented actress named heidi schanz also pops in as nosy reporter called erin who is interested in exposing the government s latest shenanigans predictably van damme and schanz team up to track down er well track down something to defeat the supercomputer i think they need some code to shut the system down but in the meantime the film takes them all over the place so that a wisecracking romeo can follow them around while absorbing all the abuse luc can hand out even throwing in a few scenes set in an adult s only club can t make this turkey fly it s dull folks and painfully so by the time the film grinds to its inevitable showdown between luc and s e t h back at the shattered compound with an injured hillary s life balancing precariously in the background to serve as motivation for an overwhelmed luc geez what a surprise there i knew i just wasted far too much of my life with this car wreck how bad can it be you ask read on plot holes in this film are innumerable as uncountable as grains of sand on the beach or acne on a teenager s face for example luc explains to erin that he was once a universal soldier just like romeo but cotner cured him by restoring him to life he no longer needs injections or ice or any of the other devices used by the soldiers what the heck are we doing marveling at this amazing supercomputer when cotner just performed a miracle of biblical implications he brought someone back from the dead how exactly did he accomplish this feat we don t find out from van damme who simply smirks his way through a few lines of dialogue that simply boggle the mind with their monumentally idiotic implications i could go on but let s discuss the performances instead or the lack thereof i should say i adore kiana tom she s a drop dead gorgeous babe with a body that could stop the earth s rotation but watching her stumble through dialogue is like having your appendix taken out through your mouth another problem is the lumbering bill goldberg whose funny lines are anything but and the more i think about heidi schanz the less i think of her you have to wonder about a film where jean claude van damme is the best thespian in the cast you might think a movie this foolhardy shouldn t contain any bonus features on dvd you would be wrong trailers for this film the return double team desert heat knock off maximum risk and nowhere to run showcase the dubious career of jean claude van damme a making of feature a van damme career retrospective ha a michael jai white feature and talent bios round out the disc my advice to those viewers thinking of renting universal soldier the return run my friends run far far away and don t look back
1,the unit does everything it promises i ve only used it once so far but i m happy with it
0,this watch does not work according to the manual i have tryed to get it to work about times my wife has tryed about at least times and i took it to a jewler and even he could not get it to work this watch is a piece of jun
1,while i think some of the reviews of xenosaga ii are a little harsh they have hit on a few good points in terms of plot the first thing that really let me down was kos mos don t let her face covering the cover of the game fool you while being one of the main characters in the first game she hardly does anything in this game until the end which seems less like a plot point and more of the creators obliging her the same can be said for shion as well this shift from center stage hurts these characters and it s really disappointing instead jr takes center stage instead of shedding light on events in the first game it opens up a whole knew set of issues that really don t get resolved if you re looking for the story pull that the first game had it ll be hard to find in this game jr is a character that i personally don t care much about but if you are a fan of him then you ll enjoy this game as you learn a lot about his past as a u r t v a new character that is introduced is shion s brother jin uzuki personally i liked jin but you don t get to use him much in the game with him shion jr and albedo there is an underlying theme of brothers or siblings in the story although don t look for much elaboration on jin and shion although some people aren t pleased with the battle system in this game i actually enjoyed it i caught into it quicker than the first game s system you can also acquire a skill that points out the enemies weak zones which i found very useful i also liked being able to build up attacks and then boost to really slam the enemy overall it s a game i really enjoyed the game has some replay value to it and there are certain things that you actually can t accomplish until you ve beaten the game once at times re watching certain scenes over and over again gets boring yet i would recommend this series as if nothing else it serves as a bridge between the first game and the upcoming third game
1,this preview has spoilers of the game please don t read it if you didn t play it i played xenogears and when i saw xenosaga episode was kinda short compare xenogears in battle system but was ok because xenosaga was like an introduction ok improvements gameplay was longer than episode i ended episode with everything in hours in change sidequest is like a plus if you want it to do it if you don t you can end the game anyways the idea of epiloge after you finish the game was very cool because you could kill special bosses and get better and kill the final boss overkilled and stuff like that chaos jr momo shion kosmos looking was improved they looked more grow up battle system to put them up or down depending who you were using or fighting as well double tech attacks all characters were able to use all magic skills as long you buy them with your skillpoints and making able with the sidequests momo bow was a very nice improvement and now she can be a very good damage dealer recover mp while stock was a good idea as well to use ep freely without any trouble people complain because history was focus in jr and urtvs but the title says itself jenseits von gut und bse means beyond good and evil wich means rubedo worring for the ladies in danger and his red dragon mode wich makes him go out of control possible reason of sakura death albedo and his obssesive love for rubedo but at the same time to kill him as well nigredo wich refused to do a mission involved with rubedo and killed his own father but he plays as good person at the moment as albedo said giving life from hand and delivering death from the other honestly second episode history role was more development than first one because wasn t an introduction and we were starting to know how things were going what they did wrong i don t see how they could think throw away the tech attacks was going to be a good idea good thing they added the tech attacks special attacks in ep you had to do stock a lot of times to make a good combo between characters wich made battles kinda boring music in battle was kinda boring compare to ep voices of chaos sounded boring kos mos like fake silly girl trying to play as a robot shion pushing and like i m better than you momo very annoying sad thing is my main team is chaos kosmos momo thats why i got sad for that voice changes but they said they refix their voices as episode in the third and last episode ep has almost hours of movies ep i guess for the complains of the long movies i still don t get it movies give more motion of the storyrole of the game wich is most of the attractive things xenosaga has over most of the games in episode is of full motion movies but plus the speak texts with faces included while characters move and do stuff like valkyrie profile they cut completly the close up when they cast spells or hit lights and stuff most of the time you see characters back all the way while you are fighting they fix that in in resume as everyone know episode had bad things but as well good things as every game no they shouldn t did it bad when they noticed the things people like of the game itself good thing is they fixed most of the bad stuff of episode to episode battle system soundtrack and characters voices all is better only thing i didn t like of episode battle mode is they make it appear as an average rpg system attack ether tech special tech and others so forget the combinations to make a tech attacks ethers cost ep cp special attacks cost boosts i wonder if attack will give some ep cp later even with all this i recommend you to buy it before you get episode because you will be losing a lot of storyline if you don t and more now they cost dollars each or less atte roy master

0,my yr old daughter really wanted this for christmas and santa was kind enough to bring it for her the quality is fine but it just doesn t do much she played with it for the first day and has touched it maybe twice since i ve seen these on clearance everywhere i ve gone lately too if your child is into playing mommy this is cute but the extra money you pay for something that moves and talks doesn t really equate to lasting play value with this one
0,i never got to use this sheet i pre washed it and put it to dry on low heat as i ve done with all the baby clothes i later saw the label said to air dry which seems ridiculous for something that ll be washed so often anyway it shrunk and doesn t fit over the co sleeper mattress if you have time space to air dry it it s probably a fine product
1,you want the greatest zombie film ever made in the most deluxe version dvd possible today buy this set today as it includes versions of the film including argento s take on the film known as zombi dawn of the dead dawn of the dead has that feel with wide camera shots that allow the characters to breathe unlike so many modern horror flicks that smother the stars with endless closeups the zombie gore is to be noted as its quite gory near the end of the film and at some parts throughout but no real feasting occurs till the end for the ultimate payoff yes the zombies are pasty and fresh since the outbreak has just began which joins a team of four who struggle to survive in a mall while the world is quickly overtaken in this dawn of the dead easily the strongest romero entry and amongst all zombie films

1,gone are the days of overpriced department store products that do absolutly nothing for your skin gone are the days of spending too much money for a product that sits in your bathroom and collects dust this is stuff is kick ass if you are the type to buy a product that is endorced by a celebrity then you can be satisfied here and if you go to the mario badescu website you can see all the celebrities who have gone to the spa and used the products if you are looking for a product that makes your skin feel clean and fresh without spending your paycheck then you have found the perfect company i have been using the products from mario badescu for three years now and i have gotten my mom mother in law sister and other friends and family to become mario badescu junkies too that all said if you want something to pamper yourself look no further try the seaweed soap and the orange protective cream and if you have a problem with pimples then look for the drying lotion but beware its strong stuff

1,ive always stayed away from the flip slider phones because im good at breaking things ive had this one for almost six months and its still going strong the mini sd port is awesome
1,i appreciate bands like ima robot film school and electroclash artists for trying to add a little balance into alternative music or at least i appreciate film school for trying to merge the beauty of electronica with alternative and allow it to simmer down to the always wonderous shoegazing while bringing back the trend of the new wave you loved in the s the thing about it is it is bands like these that are adding their own style into music making it worth your minutes and expanding your genres from just on band have you heard depeche mode s albums with a wind of boards of canada call this the album that it would have made more sense for maximo park to create if you will but this album is america s response to all other international bands showing us off hard the band is from san francisco i believe and their influence for this album is a mix of electronica and s music my bloody valentine new order depeche mode all leading them to create an album that doesn t quite call the band in question an american radiohead per se but with half of the music smothered in swirling guitars accompanying keyboards and a leaders effort to push the band forward a band that is trying to reach heights of originality film school s debut if you aren t counting their imported ep kicks off with am intro wielding only swirls of guitar and electronics before finally bringing you into an illuminating on and on that may force your urge to name this band after interpol and elefant and a little bit of the bravery in there too but will not let you throughout this entire album their current single pitfalls may cause them to swing on the vine of similarity since everyone is trying to bring back new wave these days but worse can happen for a band like this the backward keyboard melody should more than make you tell the difference the second actual interlude garrison is where boards of canada s wind starts blowing through the cd before heading back into the record that will be likely to redefine the sound of cool if there is ever an album to chase after and count on for the safety of new wave and the health of alternative i don t see a better candidate for leg ups than film school s latest rating

1,we have purchased of these tricycles in the past years for our grandsons was a gift but the other are kept at our home as i watch the boys daily the boys ages months and yrs love to ride them with the streamers flying and the bell ringing i love them because of the way they are built the center of gravity is set very low to the ground making spills and tip overs a thing of the past the rubber wheels have a better grip than the plastic wheels of other brands too i had purchased a small plastic trike and the way the wheels would just spin in place was very frustrating to the boys the old fashioned fenders on the wheels help keep little fingers from getting hurt and the wide step in the back seems to be useful when getting on or off all in all a great trike
1,if you re looking to start out in recording podcast sound clips or speech this works great i bought the package for the stand which is living up to my expectations great the xlr cord works good with my condenser mic i counted the mic as a bonus not expecting much but for an inexpensive dynamic mic it does an adequate job the package is definitely worth the that i spent for it
1,its no secret that i m not a fan of point clicks they seem to be harder in general on my computer than d action games which is something i ll never understand unless it has to do with the copy protection software i ve played through three or four of the drew games secret of the old clock was the most fun for me i liked the golf game and the sewing project i actually was proud when i finished the sewing side quest i liked driving around in the car in retrospect its analogous to guiding a magnet through a maze i had fun none the less i stumbled a little with the cb radio that got a little convoluted and bizarre but i did it the other games were either too hard or too easy this one will keep you occupied for a little while this one will employ an element of fun mar

0,i don t usually write reviews but had to voice my opinion on this toy i agree with the other review that the dolphins do not stay attached to the chariot and this frustrates my year old daughter also our dolphins fall off and the one that is supposed to flip around gets stuck and does not flip half the time all that being said she loves it
1,i was very pleased when i recieved this i love that it doesn t look like every single other pendant on the market and although it looks like it in the picture it s not enormously huge just the right size and very pretty
0,it took two people to write this book i was pleased to see a chick lit book for the something reader but this book really was a waste of my time you can see the ending a mile away for one but that didn t really bother me it was the writing the main character suffers from a syndrome that s unfortunately common to chick lit heroines which is to speak in an overly quippy aren t i clever with my snappy dialog way nearly every one of her sentences included a quip joke or a quippy thought in her head as she spoke real people just don t talk that way and it makes it impossible to relate to or care about her by the way my copy had the first chapter of these authors next book attached at the end and they ve basically created the same two main characters the quippy single mom and her ridiculously glamorous best friend i won t bother with it
1,this crib came in five days and was in perfect shape we set it up in a reasonable amount of time i can honestly say that it feels sturdier than any other cribs we were shopping for in the stores
1,when i first became obsessed with indian cooking i taught myself from books and did everything by hand including roasting and grinding my own spice blends from whole spices if you want to teach yourself indian cooking check out my so you want to guide for helpful cookbooks since then i have tried many pre made spice blends most of them lacking in flavor when compared to what i make myself and then i found neera s garam masala on the shelf at the market and discovered that this amazing product is as intense lively and flavorful as the garam masala i used to spend hours making hooray i was very happy to find it online at amazon because the markets i shop at do not carry specialty products consistently so i was becoming frustrated when i couldn t find a new jar as my old jar was starting to look empty double hooray this is great stuff and now i never have to be without

1,years of photography experience here the sigma fisheye has been extensively reviewed and compared by other websites go ahead and search and this is a very good product the canon has a tighter focus and a touch faster in focusing but with the massive depth of field with this lens it s not a problem at all be aware that if you use this on a crop factor digital slr that has aps sensors like my or digital rebel then the fisheye effect is not as pronounced on film or or full frame digital slrs watch lens flare should direct sunlight hit it also but that happens to any lens that has protruding or bulbous lenses this is a much better bang for the buck lens than the canon equivalent which costs significantly more if you search around you can find much lower prices on this lens
1,logan s run belongs to a class of old school science fiction films which were popular in the early and mid s prior to the beginning of the star wars franchise these films did not rely on non stop action or dazzling special effects but rather on thoughtful intelligent stories intriguing what if scenarios and astute social commentary they included sci fi classics such as soylent green the omega man the andromeda strain westworld and others while the shopping mall setting and some of the special effects of logan s run are pretty cheesy it is still an interesting film and its themes may be even more relevant in today s botox era than they were in the s i have heard they are doing a remake and would like to think it will improve on the original unfortunately given the recent history of hollywood it is more likely that they will drain every last bit of intelligence out of the story and replace it with more explosions and perhaps will smith
0,this collection of poems tho representing a fine breadth of dickenson s works is in final assessment a crime against the poet s great talent as is freely admitted in the introduction the editor mr higginson worked on the mechanics of the poems by smoothing out the rhymes and meter changing the line arrangements and rewriting the dialect of the local area this is a free admission of the book s guilt having adulterated dickenson s original poems in both content and form gone are the nuances and passions that make dickenson one of the best american writers gone are the premeditated dashed and capitalizations that add depth and intensity to the poems meanings and worst of all gone or altered are many lines that contribute to the unique vision of the artist as thomas h johnson says in the introduction to the complete poems of emily dickenson a representative mid nineteenth century traditionalist was being asked to judge the work of a wholly new order of craftsman which he was not equipped to estimate do yourself a favor and avoid this text instead find one that is true to the original poems one which preserves the intent and stylistic genius of the author and one which will give you the full and lasting effect of emily dickenson
0,it is unfortunate to have to write such a review but the product received was so beyond unacceptable that i am compelled to do so the unit was received new but the hinges were already rusted the closure hasp broken poorly designed and executed the grille had sloppily attached and bent locating pins and virtually all the lid edges were razor sharp made in china this stove demonstrates no attention to detail quality control or materials i own several other brands of camping stoves and am dismayed that this unit was ever allowed out of the factory much less off the design table further the design of the unit is poor and execution is extremely poor if not downright unacceptable in major ways as this unit was new in the box i can only assume that it represents the low level of quality and lack of respect the us manufacturer has for customers save yourself cut hands and returns buy another brand
1,encarta users will have no problem using and enjoying the newest version of encarta it is just as informative as the last versions with a lot of extra kicks like the newest videos recommend at least gb of ram and a pentium processor with a newer video card yrs or better for the best video viewing it will run on older system
0,this very b grade horror film left alot to be desired aside from one blasemophous scene where the demon priest sucks on a crusifix to suggest oral sex and a young man who has ripped open his shirt to carees his pecks sucks his crusifix there wasnt much to make this unrated if your expecting to see frontal or rear nudity forget it the nearest thing is teenage guys running around in tight calvin klein undies however if your someone who likes to use your imagination this might be for you one good thing about this flick is a pre charmed hottie drew fuller rubbing himself all over in his undies if your a big drew fan like me it might be worth buying utherwise go buy a playgirl
0,how do i assign a rating as several other people have experienced my unit is also doa i received it plugged it in pressed clean and the motor started up i popped open the cover put in the disc i wanted cleaned and pressed clean again nothing terrible quality control what s worse is the unit case is glued together no way to open it up to try to fix the electronics inside without mutilating it and voiding warranty

1,whether enjoyed as a gift for others or yourself there is something about the g collection that consistently leaves you wishing for just one more piece the brown and lime faux leather box a treat for the eyes in itself contains pieces of what can only be described as godiva s most ambitious and delicious chocolates to date the piece g collection closely mirrors the more expensive american pies collection but provides many unique and otherwise unobtainable pieces that more than justify the cost of the set the rich all encompassing flavor of the g collection s fruit pieces is on par with the american pies collection key lime and cherry stand out bursting from their fragile sugar coated shells with an intense and supremely enjoyable tang a box of this size ought to last one will quickly find that the richness to overuse the word marks these candies as individual luxuries to be enjoyed over time simply scarfing these down simply will not to justice to the complex excellent job godiva has done in blending different ingredients to make authentic mouth watering flavors godiva s g collection can never be explained satisfactorily until they are tried only on the tastebuds can an accurate and deserving review of these milestone candies be written
0,my experience i heard such great things about prevage restores youthful skin reverses damage etc i couldn t wait until it was available finally i was able to buy it nice packaging great dispenser of just the right amount after two months i found it to be only a great under makeup moisterizer and there are plenty of others of equal efficacy for the price eucerin for instance kinerase did nothing for me either so it may just be me just fyi fair sensitive dry skin middle aged
1,one only needs to watch ball of fire to realize the depth of barbara stanwyck s incredible talent i d match her up against any actress of her era or any other era here is a woman who can rip your heart out even when she plays unlikeable characters because she always lets you see multi dimensions of her characters sugarpuss o shea is a perfect example of a bad girl with a soft heart who succumbs to the love a naive good looking gentleman but she also shows her love to the other professors was stanwyck s greatest movie year she made meet john doe and the lady eve in this year as well and she is excellent in all of them stanwyck is the only actress i can think of who can do anything from drama to comedy to musicals and of course westerns while stanwyck s singing is not on a par with her other talents her singing was dubbed in ball of fire she can still do a musical song and dance as is evidenced in her film this is my affair where she plays a vaudeville entertainer bette davis could never play comedy and was too mannered with her rapid fire clipped speech and overacting she couldn t sing or dance as barbara did in ball of fire lady of burlesque this is my affair and banjo on my knee katharine hepburn was a good actress but very unnerving also with her mannerisms high patrician attitude and she could never play a part in a musical she couldn t sing joan crawford was a good actress in good movies but very few of her movies are good and she couldn t sing doris day was brilliant in comedy musicals and drama but she would never be believable as a villainess or a heavy the same with judy garland rare is the talent who could do it all i dare anyone to disagree with me that stanwyck was the one who could do it all drama comedy westerns musicals heroine or villainess stanwyck s work is always first class even when applied to material that is not she was simply the greatest and i m sorry this review has turned into a tribute to stanwyck but she should have won the oscar in for ball of fire when she proved that she was the greatest actress in that wonderful era of actresses the movie ball of fire is great fun from beginning to end stanwyck and cooper are unbeatable and the other professors are hilarious to watch as well there is also a marvelous musical score and the production values are top notch

1,i really enjoyed this movie at first i thought that her two husbands were vadinho the gambler and drunk and vadinho the loving husband he was bascially two different people himself i would have left him if i was her though but i understand that in that time women didn t leave their husbands also in that time it was not uncommon for men to have mistresses after vadinho s death i was happy that doña flor decided to remarry but i thought that she could ve found someone more interesting than teodoro he s a nice guy and all but he s just so boring she was used to the wildlife with vadinho and it was a shock to her when she married teodoro i think that s why she gave into vadinho when his soul returned and since she was the only one who could see him there was no harm in having realtions with him once again and in the future she was happy with both of them she was getting the best of both worlds i highly recommend this movie to all movie goers
0,my husband inflated it and was extra careful not to overinflate it but it still popped before the kids even had a chnace to try it they were so disappointed this has now happened twice fyi the first one we inflated and it deflated within days slow leak what a waste it is so heavy that it would cost to mail it back for a replacement don t bother

1,tame s music is all about the beat it s what got me right from the start a grinding repetitious backbone to every song tame one rides every beat on these tracks without faltering and shows some true style in his delivery tame gets rid of the verse hook standarda periodically ad libing and allows the music to play when he feels like pausing its an amazing album well worth purchasing
1,the earrings were exactly what i wanted the delivery date was as promised
0,mixed low review the single biggest negative is the contrast brightness level of the screen which makes it near impossible to see except at certain angles and light conditions unfortunately that is a huge achilles heal otherwise great electronics features and stylus operation i would try to demo this before buying since the screen issue could be a deal breaker unless there is something wrong with mine which i doubt i would not buy this again

0,there is nothing wrong with the knife itself but there is a major design flaw the ring to attach the knife to say a set of keys is on the wrong side so the open knife is not away from the set of keys this is the first swiss army knife i have ever come across with this flaw so alway make sure the ring is opposite the swiss army logo
0,the writing seems to have come from under educated teenage males who try too hard to look and sound cool i wasn t sure if i was reading a magazine or viewing an internet chatroom filled with juveniles this magazine isn t for men it s for boys however the one star is for the photos of the women which we can t deny both men and boys can appreciate
1,saw this film recently all the way through the thing that grabs you is the natural way the film is presented in without compromise or hestiation strogn writing acting is what carry this film from start to finish the pacing of the film keeps your attention from start to finish
1,the camera handles very well it s light and drives my zoom lens and lens beautifully i get professional photographs and can use it all day without suffering from heavy weight which it does not have the view finder is excellent and the readout on the back of the camera is extremely helpful showing photos as they are taken with zoom on the back screen which immediately gives me the idea of the photo i want to use in my books i say this is an outstanding lens and camera

1,in this cynical day and age it s truly astonishing to see a band rise from the ashes and still sound relevant not to mention amazing but how often do you get to see the inside picture offstage this film works as a eulogy to arthur killer kane a synopsis of the dolls early years and a buoy for rock n rollers lost at sea it s all things to all people but it s never boring or condescending i would actually recommend this film to lovers of cinema whether they had any knowledge of the dolls or not simply because it s a great story well told and stands up to repeated viewings
1,please note i did not find the need to order up many sizes i only ordered a half size up from my normal shoe size and they fit perfectly nice quality boot slippers with excellent traction nice arch support and a just little lift in the heel which relieves pressure from the low back i loves these boots and at a great price too fast efficent shipping as well i should say that i bought a pair of white mountain suede shearling boots and i was disappointed with the sizing as well as the quality

0,these slipcovers are tooooo expensive to fall apart after one washing i bought two of these one ripped and the other is coming apart from the inside i constantly have to cut the strings
1,one of the best films of the seventies in my opioin charles bronson plays a professinal killer who is doublecrossed by powerful mob boss who wants bronson to join his family simple straightforward action that never lets up the ending also proves memorable when bronson realizes bronson means business in this film the guy can portray this type of chracter better than anyone else and has proved it time and time again over the years
1,nice quality but overpriced does a nice job of protecting the front of the lens and reducing glare in some situations
1,this baby has helped me track my heart through all the highs and lows and ultimately allowed me to assist my doctor in verifying that something is seriously wrong with my blood pressure we re yet to verify what the culprit is but this little guy helps me know when to slow down or kick it up a notch i would highly recommend this guy if you re looking for a wrist inflatable blood pressure monitor it s been consistant reliable and informative for both myself and my doctor

0,when merging female vocal yodels and copying elements from switchblade syphony one can only be disappointed in diva destruction s music the positive aspect is the better production on this cd compared to their debut
0,i registered for these bottles i am a new mom and thought the variety was great we used the stage one nipple and my son was able to suck down his formula with no problem infact way to quick he would struggle with feeding time he was so gassy and had horrible reflux that during feeding he would arch his back stffin his body and cry i did have a recommendation to switch to the dr brown bottles which made a huge diffrence however he was still spiting up and still a little gassy just not as bad and it was managable their stage nipples were to small and the stage two were to big we had gone on a camping trip and i bought the playtex disposable bottles for easier cleaning i also had done some research on these bottles and found several people liked them better then the dr brown so i tried them and my son is doing much better he dosen t even spit up anymore so if you like the ventair i think you would like the disposable much better my sons dr wanted to put him on an antacid but i was not comfortable with giving him medication at such a young age i wanted to see if i could solve the problem which i have done completly with the playtex disposable bottles
1,this is one of the great biopic films ever made more often than not film biopics are too rushed they try and squeeze in every aspect of their subjects lives and they end up giving short shrift to the person and their lives this is not one of those films it just covers woody guthrie s adult life from when he hit the road to when he became a big time folk singer and his passionate defense of the working man the look of the film is deliberate in that it s washed out the hoedown scenes at the camp are some of the best in the film they re really lively where the extras and everyone seem to be really enjoying themselves the film has a real genuine feel to it like you re actually watching real people david carradine is amazing as woody guthrie he makes you think you re actually watching woody himself he did his own singing and stuntwork on the film ronny cox is excellent as well and he does his own singing too remember cox played the man who jammed with the hillbilly in deliverance randy quaid and melinda dillon offer great supporting roles as well this is a fabulous film and it feels short at hours
1,easiest remote to program has tremendous ability to tweek will keep recommending to all my customers
0,this perfume deserves negative stars i was in macy s when i saw this fragrance on the dior counter the bottle is gorgeous and i really like hypnotic poison and miss dior cherie so i figured i would give this one a try i really should have smelled directly from the bottle before spraying it on my skin it is horrible white floral scents are generally not my thing but i can usually tolerate them this was the worst perfume i ever smelled it s way too powdery and it smells so cheap i was stuck with it on my wrist all day and it kept making me sneeze disgusting not worth the money at all if you want to buy this scent i would recommend buying dove deodorant spray instead it s much cheaper and smells exactly the same i wonder if it really is the dove deodorant but repackaged hmm
1,i live in an apartment building and play well practice is a better word the bass guitar and needed headphones so i wouldn t bother neighbors or my wife whom sleeps and watchs tv about feet from where i sit and play the foot long cord was perfect for distance for sitting or standing and moving around while playing so i wouldn t have to use an extention cable and usualy end up with feedback distortion associated to an unshielded connector in an extention cable the volume control on each earpiece lets me adjust the volume so i don t have to mess with my amp or guitar volume settings i like to use when not using headphones makes it real nice too when using an instructional cd or dvd i can turn the bass sound off in one ear to hear the instructions clearly witout needing to seriously skew the headphones off my head very light weight some headphones can weight the head down making you feel like one of them bobble heads fits firmly on the head without any pinching or binding anywere cord enters headphones on the left ear side so you don t have to deal with the classic y split cord easy to flip to the side or drape over the back out of the way earpices fit nicly over my ears no pinching gouging or squishing with plenty of clearance around the ear and does a very nice job blocking out noise when my wife is awake she watchs the tv rather loudly which is right next to me and i bairly notice it plenty of padding around the ear pieces many headphones inside near the ear has hard plastic between the ear and speaker which usualy digs into the ear but these headphones i honestly don t feel anything against my ears even after several hours of use each night sound quality bose or pioneer they are not but then if you wanted such high quality you wouldn t be shopping in the and under headphones that being said they are very good for sound sounded very good on a portable cd player only drawbacks i can see is that a person with large tall ears won t get thier ears covered by the earpads the inside opening of the earpads is aprox inchs tall by imo they could have been made bigger also if you have a tall head good distance from top of head to ear you may find fully extended the headphones might not reach your ears i have a head like drew carry give you an idea head size shape i m talking about and if the extension to each earpiece would have been any shorter they wouldn t have fit i wear glasses as well by the way and the headphones don t interfere bind pinch or anything like that with my glasses so i highly recomend them if low cost headphones is what you are after i don t recomend things often
0,this coffee had an off sour taste it s almost as if it went bad as in milk that s past the date i only made one cup before throwing out the rest of the bag i certainly won t be ordering this brand again

1,this is a great controller especially after all the complaints microsoft had got about its original controller being too bulky personally speaking i never really had problems with even that but since i got xbox controller s i havent touched the big one this controller gives a better grip buttons are softer and their positioning is better the overall feel is quite good i played rallisport challenge with this controller and beat the whole game even in a game like rallisport where precision is required in accelaration and braking to successsfully master the tracks i did it without any problems using this controller also the vibration feel is very good so if you are looking to buy an xbox controller and are not being able to decide which just go for this smaller one controller s without any hesitation quality hardware

1,bob clark s chiller classic which went on to inspire many elements of halloween and when a stranger calls is definitely one of the better if not best horror films out there period not high on blood but very high on suspense dread atmosphere and out of the dark surprises a sorority house to include the lovely olivia hussey the vulgar alcoholic margot kidder and sctv vet andrea martin falls victim to vicious violent and altogether menacing phone calls during the christmas holidays soon students on campus begin turning up missing though some events do go unexplained which could be positive considering the mystery involved and the film tends to go borderline predictable in some sorts this is undeniably one of the creepiest horror films with the most tense moody photography ever captured on film keir dullea and margot kidder turn in quite effective performances highly recommended

0,i have worked out to denise austin for several years because i think she gives a good workout but i cannot stand her way too perky personality i was very disappointed in this dance workout the setting is fun and colorful and the music is great but as far as a workout this dvd really stinks i found some of the steps somewhat confusing but i am not very coordinated this workout was more of an indoor walk style workout like walk away the pounds w leslie sansone etc if you are looking for a fun way to get up and move this may be for you but this is not for anyone looking for a cardio intense workout
0,the drywalls in my house apparently have some insulation blown into them and i could not get the hooks to work i finally did get one in place and hung a medium large picture on it and it failed far short of the maximum weight on the package in all fariness the walls were not the right kind of walls and i think whey would work fine for small and medium pics the laser tool that was included is neat and i used it for all of my pictures which i had to hang with other hardware
1,this talented woman can sing anything i really enjoyed this cd with the lights turned down and a glass of wine to relax after a very stressful day at work renee could definitely have another singing career outside of opera should she choose hearing her drop that gorgeous voice down one octave rivals the best chanteuses in the business cassandra wilson nancy wilson regina belle sarah vaughan etc this cd of different musical styles reminds me of nina simone and cassandra wilson two great singers whom could interpret any song genre and make their versions special i loved all the songs and the standouts here are haunted heart river my one and only love my cherie amour cancao do amor and beatles in my life and hard times come again no more i hope renee keeps recording whatever catches her fancy because i ll certainly always listen

1,my son is and loved this he was very proud when he built it by himself it is very detailed and has movable parts so that you can also play with it gently of course this is the type of piece that is great all by itself without getting all the other pieces in the series it is also a classic piece in that it doesn t have a cartoon or charter theme
0,this home theater package despite being attractively priced considering its apparent functionality is ultimately very disappointing i m new to hdtv and hdmi so i didn t know as much as i needed in order to make a fully informed decision i have a sony bravia oppo upconverting dvd player scientific atlanta hd box and nintendo wii game console this unit only offers pass through video so you have to have separate video connections from the receiver to the tv for each type of input hdmi component etc for the price difference between this and other receivers that will convert to a single connection you ll pay in extra cabling costs the hdmi on this unit carries video only no sound so you have to have separate cabling to carry audio from your dvd or cable to the receiver and then from the receiver to your tv again major inconvenience and lots of additional connections the manual for this unit is beyond terrible i m astounded that an international consumer electronics firm like sony would provide a manual as difficult to use and just indirect as this one for example there was a hum when watching tv that turned out was because the speakers while looking identical are not some are shielded and some aren t nothing in the manual about this there are probably just enough hdmi and component connections for the basic user like myself plus side is that there is no dvd player with this so i can use my own given a chance to do this again i would spend a little extra on a unit that converts signals to a single output
1,i ve been getting this magazine since it first came out years ago and every issue is just as exciting as the first it not only gives you the military aspect of events but often goes into detail as to how and why these events occured which is invaluable in itself i can t wait for the next issue to come out and wish it would come out more often and the fact that it comes in hardcover format makes a nice presentation on my bookshelf thank you mh
0,the camera takes good pictures as long as you have a steady hand some pictures come out dark and some shadows on pictures some pictures come out blurry no stabalizer this camera s randomly broke after about year and i did not drop the camera just like another reviewer i bought a sony pda and the same thing happened to that lcd randomly broke has a crack across the lcd of course sony said it was my fault and that i must have done something to it and refused to honor the warranty on that pda after month since the camera was out of warranty i knew there was nothing they were going to do so if you want a decent camera with lousy customer service to support it go for it but if you want a great camera and a great company to support their products look elsewhere i used to be a great financial supporter of sony products monitors computers camcorder memory sticks etc i am not buying anymore sony products i have lost the love for sony and their products beware canon here i come

1,my sister who has kids insisted i buy this and boy was she right those of you who say it takes time to snap it on and off aren t thinking about what you have to do to change the crib sheet first of all the bumper has to be removed just to get to the mattress in any reasonable fashion and that s a pain to tie on and off especially when you get it on there just right then you have to lift up the mattress to get to the sheet bottom and pull it over the corners did i mention that moving the mattress causes that cute little dust ruffle to get out of poistion ugh i don t think so i d much rather deal with a few straps and snaps then have my daughter sit on a soaking sheet this pad wicks away the moisutre and have to go through so much trouble to change it as far as the imprint on her face i haven t noticed any and she hasn t been bothered
1,set the diffusion to stun when you don t want your flash to kill with harsh sharp shadowy edges yes you need this if you have an sb why nikon doesn t make a diffuser for that model basically it fits snugly on the tip of the flash slides off and on easy will also protect your flashbulb from acidental nicks like that macro shot of the benihana chefs here s what it does diffuses your flash without having to go all into your menu settings and make adjustments simple sherlock the omni bounce what an imaginative name for a piece of shaped plastic performs as expected no real cons except shipping adds almost to the price so check your local camera shop to see if they have it in stock before ordering
1,that s exactly what this game says to me i just couldn t refuse that s for reasons i love the movies and the game is nasty what a f in game man awesome i like it better than the gta games and scarface maybe it s cause i m such a fan of the movie maybe it s cause i m sicilian but i love this game i haven t been glued to the tv like this since devil may cry the controls are great fighting and shooting are spectacular easy to get a hold on the voice overs make it ridiculous to listen to and watch especially in the cinema scenes marlon brando james caan robert duvall the only thing is where s al pacino i would have sworn he d be in it michael corleone is nothing like michael corleone that s my only real complaint why why why isn t he in here anyway back to the pros the virtual new york city here is great the cars driving around the people walking the streets having conversation the fact that you can rob banks and trucks is sick then there s the extortion wow i love running around extorting businesses i love the fact that you can do things however you like talk to someone man to man or woman smash up their shop smack the owner around a little bit it s fun as hell the mob face is awesome i really think my character looks like me the guns are crazy especially the upgrades i got my guns all leveled up and they are ridiculous the way you create your own character and you play a part in the storyline is fantastic it s taken me hours to become don of nyc and finish the game the only thing i have left to do now is find the rest of the film reels but basically it s taken my hours to beat the game what the hell i ll start from the beginning again

0,norton old password manager worked much better it is a pain to use especially if you use the same password for serveral different websites after using it for a couple of weeks most of the time not working properly the final straw was that it suddenly stopped recognizing my infovault password several emails to norton and nothing but worthless repsonses hours wasted trying to get help from their website even when i just wanted to know if i unstalled the product would password manager still work no response
0,i don t know why i keep giving clinique a chance i have extremely oily skin and this only made it oilier if you want a very expensive toner that keeps oil away try clean clear for oily skin it s better and cheaper
1,one of the better weekly magazines that covers world affairs from what s on the news around the world to some pretty obscure things like imelda marcos shoes to life in china a society not at ease with the globalisation of the world time did a really good article on how google has allowed itself to be sensored in the name of finance makes you realise that human rights don t exsist when the dollar signs are being totted up the uk edition pretty much follows the usa edition it s an easy read and what s good is that every now and again time puts out a special edition which often follows a theme the last one was on christopher columbus worth getting a subscription also you can do what i do when you ve read a copy give it to your local dentist or doctor for their waiting room
1,i picked up the first volumne of these graphic novel series a while ago and i ve been trying to get the whole series ever since the concept is new and interesrting and the art is always great animal farm was especially good because of all the twists in the plot line nothing is as it seems to be take my word
1,what i really like about this product is that little goes a long long way i used to use various body butters on my driest skin and this product is like those in that you don t need to use much of it just a bit is enough even for really dry areas like elbows knees and feet i find one fingertipful is enough for both knees and elbows or for both feet two fingertipfuls are enough for my legs post shaving i like it better than body butters because it is light and not greasy unless you use too much and you can use it on your whole body not just the drier spots another big plus is the scent it s a fresh clean herbal scent that doesn t linger over long so you can enjoy it while you re putting it on and not have to smell it all day long
1,if you re one of those people like me who hang on to an older version of the application waiting for the right time now is the time to upgrade you won t be disappointed just ask the editors of both pc magazine and c net which awarded this version their editor s choice award once again adobe has listened to its loyal customer base the proof is in the new version of illustrator many of our requests were answered with the latest version including some that we didn t even think of i was happy to find out that even with the new features adobe has not altered illustrator s previous palettes or keyboard commands there s nothing worse than having a shortcut or command memorized for years and then it gets changed with a new version no fear here first of all i want to say that i am really impressed with the live trace and live paint features especially when used together we all know that sometimes ideas hit us when we least expect it and are away from our beloved computer we end up drawing it out on a napkin paper towel or the unused envelope from our glove compartment normally once you get back to your computer you have to try to redraw your graphic using illustrator which takes both time and effort not any more take your napkin masterpiece to your scanner and scan it in once the image has been scanned then the fun begins once the image has been scanned in and brought into illustrator use the live trace feature to actually trace your drawing this feature actually turns to drawing into a live trace object for easy manipulation after applying some blurring as needed your traced image is cleared up then convert your live trace object into a live paint object using the new control palette i like the live paint tool also because it reminds me of working in photoshop once you ve converted to the live paint object you can easily use the pen and other tools to modify any points to your liking live paint also has a feature called gap detector which can prevents paint from going over into other sections because of a break in a line this is a handy feature that keeps you from having to fix overspill later when the object outlines are finalized use the live paint feature to easily fill any region with color voila you are done go from napkin to art in a matter of minutes a concern of many of us for years was the fact that while illustrator keep getting better and newer features it also mean more and more palettes sometimes it became a little unmanageable however the pros at adobe recognized this problem and applied a solution the control palette this new palette sits at the top of the screen first it acts as a an object inspector providing information secondly and more importantly the control palette provides easy access to fill and stroke dropdown menus brush shape opacity and style no longer do you have to fumble through your palette to get at these frequently used features if you are fans of adobe s other creative suite software you will be pleased to learn that the control palette is apart of their new makeover too here are some more new additions and changes to illustrator like photoshop illustrator now supports custom workspaces you can display only the palettes you need at any time you are also able to access or save any workspace at any time or use workspace templates adobe has improved the swatch and color integration now working with the other creative suite programs is seamless isolation mode is a feature that allows you to double click a group move and edit internal objects without having to search through the layers palette now supports all of the latest wacom tablets it now provides brush support for the new wacom art pen and adds a new dimension illustrator s calligraphic and scatter brushes adobe bridge integration is now a part of illustrator bridge allows you to easily manage images through thumbnails for better workflow macromedia flash exports are now available you can export both text and objects as flash files which result in smaller file size and easier incorporation into web projects you can now open photoshop files with layer comps within illustrator this new feature allows you to view many versions of a layout at one time just as you do in photoshop custom stroke placement is a new addition to illustrator you can now place strokes on the outside inside or center of a path underline and strikethrough are two of over new type enhancements these are a few of the new features the upgrade cost is well worth the money just for the live trace and live paint features alone however you get so much more in the new illustrator upgrade now and be completely satisfied if you haven t purchased a vector graphics program get illustrator especially if you are already an owner of a version of photoshop this new version of illustrator even looks more like the familiar photoshop layout loren elks group manager d mag org
0,i got the phone because it was small but i didn t know i d be sacrificing so much the speakerphone only works when the call picks up and my text message inbox fills up basically every day i get shoddy service and while i do like the design there are lots of places where the paint has chipped away and i can see thru to the casing all in all an okay phone if all you want it for is emergencies but it s not really the best for what you ll want to do with your cell phone
0,one battery trimmers simply not strong enough was glad to find a two batteries version it has a perfect design which will attract many more naive surfers like me unfortunately it s not good for nose hair trimming problem is it makes electric like unpleasant sensations when touches sensitive skin inside nose so much that it makes you scared using it it also doesn t cut well doesn t reach inside makes burning smell and overheated update on from my recent experience the microtouch turbo is an excellent alternative which has no problems mentioned above the only problem is its durability you may find yourself buying per year but at the price below this is not a real issue good luck
0,this filter is fine for normal shooting but if you do low light work beware you will see bad internal reflections on night shots and will need to remove the filter
1,i love this stroller and tell all of my friends about it our daughter was about months old when i purchased it there was not a better rated stroller available when i researched and there still is not you can run walk or rollerblade behind this stroller and feel confident that your child is safe lilyana is now months and loves going for our daily walks and occasional rollerblading she is a fussy girl only when it comes to being strapped down in the carseat but loves the comfort and hammock like feel of bob we live in florida and with the sun guard canopy she is well covered some other factors which made we chose bob the braking mechanism which is hard to find has a wrist strap which if you should fall locks the back wheels unlike most strollers on the market this feature is great for rollerbladers point safety harness pound weight limit highest that i found metal frame others have more plastic that metal shock absorbers great of rocking bouncing her to sleep swivel front wheel which locks with a simple pin simple lily likes it and we tried several others all that babies r us has in stock the cost is pretty high but would you put a price on the safety of your child if you were to fall while exercising thanks for hearing me out
1,i love the shine lip glosses offer but really do dislike the stickiness when wearing a gloss lip prints come off on glasses paper cups are the worst napkins and whoever you ve just buzzed found the answer to the stickies with chanel s aqualumiere line the lipsticks give the slick shine without the telltale spots it can be blotted and still shines as if that weren t enough it s my favorite shade is macao a rosy pink

1,tastykake s butterscotch krimpets are the favorite food of the title character in the fifth grade story of maniac magee by jerry spinelli they are a light and delicious treat that we passed out to a fifth grade class in speedway in the kids thoroughly enjoyed the book and were thrilled to have their very own butterscotch krimpets to enjoy too there are two to a pack packs to a box reasonably priced light and delicious no cream filling only a light butterscotch frosting the awaiting treat made this a good reason to finish the book
1,quick shipping but poor packaging there was obvious chips of metal from the structure in the packaging and one of the main screw and bolts pagackages were already open lucky i found all bad packaging but excellent bench it takes a decent bit of assembly but it fit perfect in my car garage and still lets car in great multi function product you can do all core lifts and also do lats and curls to build the minor muscles for definition pretty sturdy structure but seems a tad bit hallow no problems yet for a hundred fifty five bucks with free shipping another value it was really worth it i say to anyone who likes it its worth it just get it wether your a pro or beginnger its good for getting stronger and adding mass
0,if i had for every time a app crashed and made expend real hours to redo work i d have about and that s enough for me to say beware of this set of applications adobe has allowed them to get too bloated too slow and the results are that all the programs but principally golive indesign and illustrator in that order are crashy and will quite suddenly forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished i cannot stress how disappointed i am in adobe and how distraught i am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future in any event do not buy the apps adobe does not deserve your support
0,i had this model or at least it looked the same for a few years and it worked exceptionally well it finally broke down recently and i thought i was lucky enough to find it again but they must have changed the product significantly because it does not work very well at all actually it is virtually useless as it only partially gets the job done which of course is like not having it done at all
1,i bought this set for my son who loves to draw and paint he absolutely loved this set the colors are wonderful and the different types of pens paints and crayons make drawing alot more fun for him the case is sturdy and great so he doesn t lose anything the price can t be better for everything you get

0,this film offers none of the cheap thrills of a horror film and has many flaws a silly plot cheap religious imagery dracula is judas jeez louise and not one truly sexy or scary moment and it wastes three gorgeous gals as dracula s brides including jennifer esposito jeri ryan if you can t make a film sexy with these two you re in the wrong business craven has an over inflated rep as a director he doesn t deserve any rep as a producer if this leaden film is a sample it makes the worse universal horror film look like citizen kane in comparison save your money and pick up something scary instead like bava s black sunday or any hammer horror
1,this suit is exactly what i ordered small enough for training racing but not as small as a traditional speedo suit
1,this is my favorite cereal ever since i started eating only organic i picked this up one day and i love it i eat it every morning for breakfast
0,it does not like rapid changes in temperature when the sun stops hitting it in the cold weather it takes an hour before the screen comes back all of that is moot because now after only weeks of operation it only works indoors though it is a mere degrees outside sent it back
0,bought a cell phone battery from this company and it was defective and died one week after their return replacement deadline shouldn t a cell phone battery last longer than a month they refuse to refund or replace they are a shady company and i ll never do business with them again and will warn others to do the same

1,today i received the first issue april issue i found it amazing and informative resource for body mind and soul practices toward healthier life the most thing i liked about this magazine is that it respects religions it provides accurate information from various religions to help people of other believes improve their lives relying to what i read until now in this issue
1,this product is the best it s so simple to use no heat no thermals just the simple turning of a crank simple is often better and that is definitely the case here i use the tool to laminate spec sheets for selling high end sports cars and the result is super professional i suggest also getting a paper cutter from staples because you may want to trim up the end product
1,these are truly good gluten free cookies we have recently made the switch over to a casein free milk free gluten free diet for the sake of my son he is already a picky eater so i was worried about the transition these cookies provided him with a yummy replacement snack for snack time that competes with the snacks that are being served ie in church school etc he is particularly enamored with them because they have kid friendly animal imprints being gluten free they do tend to break more which can be upsetting for young kids but they taste so good he has been able to overcome this fault and is even willing to eat the broken pieces
1,i love this car seat except for the fact that the one i have is defective the crotch snap does not work properly when i contacted baby trend they advised that they do not exchange or repair their products free even though mine was manufactured in october i contacted them in december less than a month after i bought it otherwise this is a wonderful seat i love the triangular handle i use it with the snap go and have no trouble at all transferring her if she falls asleep in it it is easy to take her wherever i want without disturbing her she seems very comfortable in it as well she was born november the hood is such that it can block out the sun no matter from which direction it is shining and you can still see her face if you are tall enough the product is great if yours if fully functioning i m anxious for her to grow to pounds so i can buy another seat as it is i try not to take her in the car any more than i have to because of the defective lock since i can t spring for another seat now i will never buy another baby trend for that reason
0,very disappointed in the cheap quality and dull color it doesn t look as nice as what they show on the internet i returned it for a refund
1,when i first heard this album i was a bit shocked myself and my fellow tmbg fans derided it as a teen angst album moaned and whined that john john had betrayed us by adding a band and generally refused to give it a chance a few years later listening to my entire collection of tmbg in chonological order a sanity restoration ritual i realized that this album is awesome there are only stupid songs window and dirtbike hey for tmbg that s not bad their fans forgive them stupidity on a regular basis aside from that there are more rockin thought provoking tunes here than you ll find almost anywhere this album establishes beyond a doubt that tmbg are among the most gifted songwriters in rock history i m not going to go over each individual song there are millions of tmbg fans who have and will i will add my cents about my favorites however i should be allowed to think tmbg does justice to beat poetry and beyond why must i be sad funny and pissy great for getting those pesky emotions unstuck the lyrics are genius subtly quoting the best of alice cooper with tongue firmly planted in cheek a self called nowhere righteous angry and breathtaking angsty punk bands of the world take note you will never be this hardcore the end of the tour i have written in my last wishes that i want this one played at my funeral one of the most moving and emotionally honest rock ballads ever written if your idea of tmbg is songs like istanbul and particle man get over it and give this album a chance
0,this will be the third time i have tried to post a review of this unacceptably bad album and i suppose i have been too harsh because neither of my previous efforts have been posted lets keep this one simple this is not music plain and simple i purchased this due to glowing recommendations from other reviewers on this site and was terribly disappointed it basically consists of massively distorted and detuned guitar and bass monotonously droning on and on for nearly an hour with no coherence structure or anything approximating the actual ability to play an instrument call it performance art experimental noise whatever it s simply not music
1,you can clean any kind of metal with this product i think you should buy it for the most part it s like copper and silver polish only it s intended for metal sometimes it may leave a few streaks here and there if you don t wipe the surface of the metal entirely if that happens apply a touch of water and continue rubbing until the streaks go away
1,fluke s latest album had been long in coming and plagued with issues word on the grapevine is one of the trend setting trio left some point during production still years after their masterpiece risotto fluke has returned intact and delivered another album the oddly titled puppy puppy is for the most part a dark album it s clearly the evolution of the track absurd off risotto and its particular taste of big beat techno with numerous tracks featuring similarly styled lyrics and vocals the sound has been expanded with touches of industrial guitars and beats that would sound right at home in prodigy s fat of the land or at a nine inch nails concert the opening snapshot shows this most evidently the album takes up a rave feel with the tracks another kind of blues a remix of the stellar number zion featured in the matrix reloaded and its soundtrack and hang tough which flow into each other and result in a mesh of old school rave beats with new school industrial grooves ykk is a wicked track that would easily be at home in a big budget spy or action flick while expo is a sweeping and epic song blue sky is as close to an uplifting number you ll find on the cd with a full choir used in the song s chorus compared to risotto puppy inevitably comes up short like bt s emotional technology puppy has the misfortune of being the follow up album to a complete and utter masterpiece puppy to risotto emotional technology to movement in still life and let s face it it s hard to surpass yourself when release an album that s nigh perfect still i wasn t sure what to expect with puppy and i found myself pleasantly surprised it s darker and meaner but it s an overall rock solid album and fans of the grittier side of fluke absurd atom bomb will likely be pleased with puppy
1,these sweaters are excellent quality cashmere and i just bought another one in a different color they feel like a million dollars and come from an esteemed napoletana designer ermenegildo zegna but as a general rule when buying italian clothing always buy them bigger than you would expect i normally wear a size large shirt in the us never xl i am and lbs i bought a size x large and it is comfortably roomy and not too huggy on the fat i think some of the similar sweaters from zegna are more delicate read see through this one is a little thicker but still thin for a sweater i really like wearing it with a t shirt underneath feeling the soft cashmere on your arms
0,it s loud you can t hear the lyrics nor the words just a lot of loud noise great if you want to damage your hearing
0,spin is an accurate name for something like this a lot of hype for an innocuous but rather tepid rock magazine if rolling stone is the dirty old geezer of rock magazines then spin is the teenager who tries hard to convince you he s cool by name dropping the strokes spin covers some of the same turf as rolling stone and blender but less lasciviously lots of coverage of popular bands some of them are quite good the hives for example or indie newcomer steve burns who quit his job on blues clues after hearing a flaming lips album and reinvented his life as a rocker unfortunately they overemphasize whatever bands are hot at the moment and then overemphasize them again as well as tacking them up in whatever coolest best lists they chalk up for the year decade century history of rock indie cred is maintained by a few half page articles on potentially hot bands like the comas and metric but this info is halfhearted it s like they re reluctant to tear themselves away from articles on better known bands regardless of talent the writing however has that certain affliction that a lot of major rock magazines have the need to be cool their writers always are trying to be funny but rarely come across that way it seems silly and strained like a soccer mom wearing a spandex tube dress even the cd reviews are mediocre however one recent highlight is dave eggers columns witty funny and a little bit skewed in fact they are often the best things in the entirety of the magazine one of the problems is the emphasis on stuff in hollywood scarlett johanssen is a wonderful actress yes but she doesn t sing nor has she appeared in a music based movie jack black yes scarlett no and what is up with party coverage on tv starlet mischa barton and mtv couples check out sublimely indie mags like chord filter under the radar and the online kludge for in depth looks at some worthy bands as for spin it s still trying to convince us it s cool but eggers is the only regularly cool thing about it
0,what s wrong with this show jim wears the same pants coat and shirt for almost every episode throughout the entire run of the series a slow sluggish middle aged man is supposed to outdo younger hoodlums won t that woman lawyer ever get a real boyfriend that will do right by her do you really believe that this middle aged heavy fellow would drive a firebird a tight fitting car angel
1,after sixteen long years final fantasy iii finally sees an official release outside of japan however unlike previous games final fantasy iii has been completely reworked this is more than just a port with enhanced graphics final fantasy iii includes some new secrets and side quests in addition to its graphical overhaul final fantasy iii may be just about enough to please some hardcore fans but was the wait really worth it well yes but the game isn t perfect the storyline of final fantasy iii is entirely too simple the crystals are losing their powers and there are only four warriors that can come forth and save the world from falling into darkness sixteen years ago this was a pretty standard story but when compared to your average rpg today and current final fantasy games the storyline to final fantasy iii is a joke there s nothing in this story that screams epic and the characters involved aren t developed very well luckily we can let it slide because its sixteen years old gameplay wise final fantasy iii is pretty similar to most rpgs of today you ll go roaming through dungeons and towns getting into random battles there are a few quirks to the game that the ds utilizes you ll find moments where you ll have to zoom into certain objects for you to examine it should also be noted that you can use the touch screen almost exclusively in the game using the stylus you can make your character run in the direction you want him to by gliding it across the screen taping on things makes your character examine it and ultimately this is how you open chests and talk to people it works out but it feels really clumbsy at times if you re looking to get through a dungeon with little hassle just stick to the directional buttons to its credit though using the stylus makes menu navigation much faster but for the most part the stylus controls just feel tacked on combat is traditional turn based combat there s no atb gauge like in later final fantasy games in each round you will choose all the commands for your characters to do and then watch a round of battle take place it s simple but isn t always fun mainly because final fantasy iii is a challenge if you began with some of the later final fantasy games then this installment may be a little too difficult sometimes combat is unforgiving especially when faced with bosses that attack twice per turn and have the power to take out a character in a single shot even worse the encounter rate is pretty high and running away from battle is often a wasted effort because you ll fail so many times trying to do so you ll probably get wiped out just trying to run from battle and failing so many times there are several moments when you ll be forced to battle for hours just leveling up this is fine for those used to old school rpgs but many rpgs of today do not put so much emphasis on leveling up and it may try your patience after a while it s great for people looking for a challenge at least but for some it may be a bit too steep the job system is interesting as you go through the game you ll get crystal shards that allow your characters to use certain jobs each job has its own set of abilities that can be learned with it for example white mages specialize in the healing arts black mages in attack magic and red mages can do a little bit of both you ve also got other classes like warriors who can take damage for other party members thieves who can steal and much more there are jobs in all and the possibilities are nearly endless the jobs you choose for your characters also have an impact on your stats mages for example don t have a lot of strength but they excel in magic also as you gain levels you ll also gain job levels so it s not only important to make sure your characters are at a good level but also at a good job level the game looks absolutely stunning at least for the nintendo ds it is by far one of the best looking out there there are some moments where it looks pixilated but you can t deny that the game just looks good regardless the movie sequences are also really pretty to look at and they run surprisingly well in battle is also fantastic your enemies sport some amazing detail and so do the backgrounds in battle on the whole the game just looks good perhaps the only fault of the graphics is how restricted the animation of characters and enemies are in combat your characters won t physically go up and strike an enemy rather they just step forward and swing very similar to how the final fantasy games of the nes worked it s strange to see but you ll quickly get used to it another thing that seems kind of strange though is that the top screen throughout most of the game remains blank all the action takes place on the bottom screen there are few moments when the top screen actually displays anything you ll see the world map as you travel the overworld and while you re in towns there are certain moments where the top screen has text or shows an important story sequence but that s usually about it other than that when trumping through dungeons as you do often and in battle as you also do often the top screen remains blank there s nothing wrong with it but it feels very awkward to play a nintendo ds game where the top screen is blank they could ve used it to display dungeon maps or enemy information or something the top screen has no impact on gameplay whatsoever the music in the game is pretty good though it s not as good as other games in the series and there are some tunes that just aren t great but the music is by no means bad there s no voice acting in the game really but we can let that slide audio wise the game is good final fantasy iii is a pretty satisfying experience for any final fantasy fan looking for a good challenge and to see how far the series has come however it may also shed a little too much of its old school charm in some areas particularly its unforgiving challenge still it s worth it for final fantasy fans who want to see just how far the series has come the good finally a chance to play final fantasy iii great visual look good music the job system is interesting it provides a good challenge a fair amount of secrets and sidequests the bad the story is not all that great for some the game might provide too much of a challenge to the point of frustration high random encounter rate throughout most of your adventure the top screen is just blank for a nintendo ds game this just feels awkwar
1,this carry case is great it would be even greater if it had a carry strap
1,this was ordered for our year old she just loves it very realistic features size of set quality is why fisher price is still the very best for imaginations of all ages
0,think twice before purchase most of the good tracks are available on the non copy protected all time top tv themes along with the best themes from other networks this disc has cds copy protection so you probably can t upload to windows media and definitely not to itunes i could not upload from my internal cd drive only from an external multi format cd dvd burner it still only uploaded to windows media not itunes to get into itunes i had to add the wma files and then convert them to this probably caused some quality loss as i m converting one compressed format to another compressed format a time consuming and tedious process which could have been avoided altogether if music companies would get over this fixation on controlling everything hello record execs if nobody can add your discs to their libraries guess what happens they don t play your music you might think you re protecting your valuable investment but you re shooting yourself in the foot instead here s how it goes nobody can upload your music nobody plays your music nobody hears your music nobody recommends your music nobody buys your music remember this only loaded from a particular kind of drive so it may or may not work on yours as bela lugosi would say bevare
0,i was very dissapointed with the product it was displayed as something that was simple to use and fun for all ages i ordered of them for my grandchildren and when they opened them for christmas we found that they were clumsy to use the sound quality is poor at best and they are made of hard plastic which is not particularly safe to be whacking on anything and everything as i was led to believe we are a musical family and therefore more inclined to try to produce music from various sources but i am afraid this is not worth the money if i had opened them before christmas i would have returned them but it was too late so now they are stuck with them
1,we learned about agave nectar in san francisco at tres agaves a mexican restaurant that makes the best margaritas we have ever had they use reposado blue agave tequila with lime juice and with agave nectar to take the bite off when we got our bottle we made margaritas that were also amazing and then began using it whenever we would normally use honey i especially like it for slightly sweetening a home made vinagerette wonderful stuff
1,we use this travel turtle on the airplane and in the car for my and year old children it s intended for children a little older and i can see why as they are not able to easily balance the turtle on their laps however my year old can use it by herself and it helped her to have a flat place to color and play with her magnetic board toys i had to hold it in place for my year old but when doing so it also allowed him to color i would recommend it especially for children and up
0,i send away for a year subscription they sent me a year sub i wrote letters sent copies of bank cheque and order form emailed them no response they could care less what more can i do
0,first of all ike is doing the very thing that tina always said he would do ike turner will never admit to what he did to tina tina stayed around him for so long because she promised that she would never leave him like all the others ike took advantage of her tina her self said she cared very much for him cher even had seen what was going on and tried to convince tina to leave him even the girls that danced with tina on stage had whitnessed what happened tina did not write her autobiography to promote her career she herself said that she did not want to talk about what happened but the public kept asking her what had went on so she released her autobiography in well after her come back in while ike can try to deny it all he wants the truth is he violently abused tina and considering the person ike turner is i would expect him to do no less than to lie and make a pathetic excusse of a come back
1,i absolutely love this walker the songs it plays and the lights that flash really keep a baby entertained i also love the ease of collasping it down so that it can be stored away somewhere there are also great safety features such as the grip strips on the bottom the wheels are very easily manuevered also i would definitely recommend this product to other moms
1,i needed a new camera to replace my very old digital camera so i ordered this one and could not be happier with it it has all kinds of features including some manual control options like white balance etc for those people who like to mess with that stuff i m more of an auto person myself i used it on vacation last month and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of pictures after taking only a few test shots to get familiar with the camera the camera is very easy to use and gives you a basic user manual to get you started and also a detailed manual to help you find out how everything works on the camera the movie mode works good too the colors come out bright and vivid the lag time between pictures is minimal which is one of the main things i hated about my old panasonic palmcam and the makes for some excellent detail in your pictures the only bad thing about the camera in my opinion is that it doesn t have a movement stabilizer or whatever it is called so it can be prone to shaking especially when you zoom using the digital zoom i like that the camera is small and lightweight but it is not one of those super thin ones that you feel like you could break in half overall i think this is a great camera and i don t think you can find a better camera for the price
0,i used to buy this off the shelf each month but last november my wife bought me a subscription i bought the december issue cause it hadn t arrived by mail yet no problem in january i received the november issue a few weeks later in early february i received the december issue but not the january so i went out and bought the january by the end of february still hadn t received the feb yet so bought it then received the january issue and a few weeks later the february i was fed up i know they were getting caught up but not only was i getting editions that i d already bought off the shelf but i figured these were counting against my issues i cancelled they deducted a few bucks from my refund for issues received and had no apologies for the mess i like the magazine but i will say that if you read it over time it become redundant the suggested work outs are mostly rehashes of past work out routines lets face it there are only so many ways to work out and when you get right down to it you gotta hit it hard and often change things up etc bla bla bla the best part of the magazine are the few pages they dedicate to the correct way to execute a lift or detail what muscles are hit lots of weider ads but then its a weider publication so what can you expect i d buy it off the shelf because you ll eventually get tired of the same old thing and their subscription program is iffy
1,i bought this product because i had tried with great success another punch product it was so easy to use and load onto my computer it was a great value to be able to have one product that allows me to redesign anything from interior floors and walls to my deck and plants outside

0,i wasn t pleased with this book i ve read all of ms warren s e books and i have to say they have a lot more fire she lost a lot in this book somewhere around the middle of the book i started thinking did i actually buy a book this bad because i enjoyed her e books so much i didn t stop to think before purchasing it i was so happy to have her book i immediately called a friend who also drove to the book store to purchase the book boy did i get it from her the next day because we don t believe in throwing money away we re still stuggling to finish the book hopefully there is light at the end of the tunnel
0,this is a great product for a few weeks then the velcro gets really weak and your child will be busting out i go in to find my son with both arms out and one leg out no matter how tight i make the blanket the velcro comes apart i encourage you to buy their other swaddleme blanket with the larger velcro flap
0,i picked up the audio book from the library and didn t know by the title and author s name my first jance book that this was chick lit i don t feel this book was something i would ve started had i known it started real well and ms jance knows how to reel you in with her writing midway it got off track for me when the the protagonist started blogging about her unfair release as a new anchor and then about her friend who died of als and then came the long responses to the blogs it just got sickening to this reader and made it hard to stay with what could ve been a decent suspense drama
0,my desktop cd rom refused to recognize that the cd was in the tray it did recognize other cds my desktop is a hp pavilion with windows xp homeversion my laptop did accept the cd so i know that it is not the cd i purchased the product for use on my desktop not the laptop i would appreciate instructions on fixing the problem
0,this tablecloth bleeds as soon as it got wet we all ended up with red checked arms i ordered a dozen from oriental trader for the same price and they are perfect go figure avoid these
1,there s not much to say about the reputation of these movies there s also little to say about these dvds many of which are the high quality special edition collections just do the math this is no brainer for people who don t own any of these dvds even if you only want of them less than half that s about a movie at amazon s present sales price and since many of these movies are special editions that s still a steal this is a solid place to start your dvd collection not everyone will enjoy all these movies after all they range from westerns to romantic pieces to musicals but at this price even giving half of them away still allows you a tremendous savings one note the version of amadeus here is the reissue and the longer director s cut of the movie that was not originally released some including myself prefer the tighter original release which can still be gotten at amazon but sadly has no commentary and requires you to flip the disc in the middle of the movie
0,this was the first digital camera i purchased i am an adventurous person and wanted something that would stand up to my lifestyle this camera wasn t it the good it is compact which is pretty convenient it has several camera functions that have the potential to work well if you are techno savvy the bad after snorkeling with it for minutes the camera leaked and broke olympus replaced it but only after my month stay in costa rica was over the functions are unreliable and difficult to use rarely if ever do i get them to work how i want the pictures always need touched up afterwards sometimes seriously the zoom sucks don t expect to get those awesome close ups they advertise unless you have some serious patience the image stabilization is a joke you need a tripod or surgeons hands to take pictures that aren t blurry the user manual left me with a lot of questions
1,it kept me guessing till the end i didn t want to put it down the only part that i would have changed would have been that the one lady would have lived can t wait to read her next book
1,the stores near my house charge over a box for the organic type half of me thinks it s great to have it avail on demand through amazon for cheaper the other half is ashamed to waste the fossil fuel on a special trip to my house i think annie s should be able to make their product a little cheaper by now it s pretty dang popular oh well the alfredo variety isn t avail thru amazon right now anyway so i m stuck again watching for sales and stocking up which makes the formerly ashamed half of me happy
1,quality of leather looks nice i can see what the other writer meant about the clasp coming off it s metal squeazed to leather and that s what i expected you just have to keep an eye on it and don t sleep or shower in it it looks nice
0,make sure that your bike is compatible with this trailer it doesn t work with every bike it didn t with mine i called allegro medical several times to try and return it and they gave me a hard time about it saying i cant return it unless it is defective so now i have a bike trailer and a bike that don t work together and i m out horrible
0,very cute but have a funky balance wobly and on the verge of falling over not comftorable poorly designe
0,this is pretty much kid vs kid only adults cannot play along you can make it into a solo game for one child but its really more like flash cards for spelling if you do that the product is basically a set of flash cards for spelling with some letter cubes for the kids to spell out the words the rules propose two games which are basically see if the kids spells the word right they get to keep the card if they do first kid with cards wins adults can pretend to play along if the child is younger and will fall for it it really works as a game only if there are two kids the same age playing i don t know but i can t see my daughter pulling this out when a friend comes over therefore to the extent this is a set of flash cards for spelling its kind of expensive for what it is don t get me wrong you can definitely make it into a learning tool your call
0,this compass handles very poorly compared to other manufacturers the pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break the card actual compass part that spins wobbles a lot so it s difficult to get an exact bearing it is like the oil in the compass is very thin also the direction line lid spins easily making it possible to take a bad reading ironically this is the silva weakness as well if you need an inexpensive engineer style compass consider the silva for a two more dollars you get an aluminum case a hinge that won t break and a card that doesn t wobble with the slightest hand movement
1,i was hoping for more of an around the wrist type lanyard but this is around the neck and the clasp was not to my use i needed it for the use of carrying around usb flash memory but the clasps where to large to fit into the holes made for smaller clasps i would say these are still nice for the gym teachers and ref s out there that need them for the whistles
0,i am an adoptive mom that was told that this pump was hospital grade and it has not helped at all therefore i would not reccomend it for those that are trying to induce lactation i liked the concept of this item and it was comfy i had this pump for a year and had to return it to the manucaturer times because the pump body stopped working i would not recomend this pump at least not to adoptive mothers the customer service was awesome though they were understanding and helpful i eventually ended up getting a refund and then buying a medela
1,i already owned a fenix which amazed me with the impressive light it threw from something so tiny it was easily small enough to fit on my key chain and so it is always with me even a great light source is useless if it s not accessible when you need it i owned a surefire ultra which is a great flashlight but obscenely expensive but you could feel the quality and knew it would last a few decades i love the rear clicky button design and the levels of light i expected some similar design elements in this new fenix i was disappointed to see that to switch to the different settings you have to screw the collar left right then left right again and so on so if there is one setting you use most often you must go through the whole turns just to get back to it next time come on that s just stupid i will keep it only to avoid the exchange hassle and it still is a good value considering the size and light output especially compared to the uberpriced surefires but there is no comparison as far as construction or quality so stars is all i could muster for the crude setting selection method design and the adequate but toylike feel of the casing construction
1,i was so surprised when i opened this box of cards because the quality of the cards is excellent the cards are unique but appropriate for many occasions
0,can you say p a i n this is what steve madden shoes are pain the soles must be made of cast iron the upper materials must be made of the roughest of rope or some material meant to be deliberately scratchy and rough i am convinced that this madden person hates women if it were in my power i would track down steve madden and force said person to wear their own shoe designs only standing walking and dancing even until they committed to making shoes that are fit for human beings to wear without any pain
0,i was very disappointed with this show having read the reviews i decided to buy the dvd now i feel cheated the jokes are weak his inaccurate depiction of africa and his off the mark african accent were more annoying than amusing jamie was crude disgusting and even more disappointingly not funny at all he will look back at this and feel acknowlege that it wasn t his best performance he had such good material to base his jokes on but he flopped quite badly i do not recommend this dvd at all

1,great headphones for running they fit my ears perfectly and i don t have to worry about foam anymore
1,i ve never used any other type of oil filter wrench or strap but this tool worked for me when i couldn t twist off an oil filter by hand it uses a drive but it doesn t snap onto the wrench so it can fall off easily as long as you are careful you shouldn t have a problem and it will save you a lot of time when changing your oil filter the prongs can be adjusted by holding onto the base and turning the socket with a wrench the prongs rotate around the base depending on the direction you turn the way it works is that at the widest position turning in either direction will cause the prongs to close in on a certain direction that way as long as you have the prongs closing in on the proper direction when you are trying to remove an oil filter it will grip harder as you turn counter clockwise if you have the prongs closing in on the wrong direction then turning counter clockwise will actually widen the prongs
1,the drishti yoga strap is just great i ve tried a lot of straps in my time practicing yoga several different studios borrowed friends etc this one is excellent it s feet longer than standards straps but it s offered at the same price as standard straps what a deal it s also thick and sturdy i would certainly recommend this product

1,i have had this for months now and it has worked out well i use it on my cingular phone while i exercise i can listen to audiobooks on a sports headphone when a call comes the audibleplayer pauses and i can answer the phone with the built in button voice quality is fine on my end in both ears and i have received no complaints from the other end unlike the other reviewer maybe he got a bad unit or his stereo connector is dirty when the call is over the audibleplayer resumes i never have to stop my exercise or even slow down my only complaint is that the volume control doesn t work worth beans when you rotate it at various positions you will hear from one ear or the other there are a few positions where you will hear in both ears but that is not at the maximum volume this is a bit annoying but something i can live with i just leave it at one position close to the max volume but a little less and use the volume control on my cell phone to adjust volume
0,i agree with other reviewers that it feels good and doesn t smell too much however i ve experimented with it several times to confirm my findings and it turns out to give me really bad blackheads i m with an oily t zone and very dry facial skin on mornings after using this cream i have nasty blackheads on my forehead and chin there are better products out there
0,man have i given this guy a chance multiple chances listened to the cds saw the big hbo special i mean his career is red hot now he clearly has lots of fans mostly college age perhaps this should be a warning to some of you all i can say is maybe they ll grow out of it he is not funny his act has no bite no point of view no opinion viewpoint at all his comedy consists of spewing observations his audience can relate to the this is all happened to us or has this ever happened to you school of humor he runs about manically acting out every little word that comes out of his mouth for those in the audience that may not be so good with words his fans acknowledge that yes they can relate yeah that s happened to me i know that reference they laugh cheer clap and plunk down their hard earned dollars for his vanilla wit he never actually comments on the things he discusses in any intelligent interesting way he has no edge he s not outraged by anything he s cute n cuddly richard pryor must be rolling in his grave at the very fact that cook is classified as a stand up comic pryor the guy writing this must be old okay try this on for size chris rock is good comedy same with dave chappelle carlin laura kightlinger kinison rodney dangerfield bob saget gilbert gottfried dom irrera lewis black robert klein the late mitch hedberg jim norton patton oswalt brian posehn degeneres jon stewart bob david the ucb i m not even a big fan of sarah silverman but at least she s trying to bring something different to the party anything but this god help us let s hope he goes the way of carrot top and dice soon don t forget cook fans mr top and mr clay were once as popular as your boy here
0,the idea of the stroller is great however after purchasing and using it it isn t well equipped there is no cup holders the basket for storage is not easy to get to and isn t even big enough to hold a diaper bag let alone any bags when shopping i also have to take it apart to even fit it in my trunk need less to say i don t even use it much b c it is too hard to maneuver with two kids i wasted my money on this graco has a new one out that looks so much better and much for equipped for on the go moms like me wish i would have waited it is the same price wish i could have exchanged it

1,casein is a great long lasting protein perfect for right before bed as its aminos are release more slowly than whey casein in general is bland think no fat no salt cottage cheese and harder to mix than whey optimum nutrition has here a decent casein that is not too bad tasting and mixes better than most every other casein i ve tried the price is ok but i d like to see it cheaper who wouldn t i mix it with whey and use it throughout the day i have tried and rejected the chocolate flavor
1,i have gone through several smartphones in the past months including cingular htc and nokia and can safely say that this is the best phone i have owned the palm operating system is much easier to use than the windows operating system albeit less powerful and much more customizable and synchronization friendly than the symbian os its great for easy installation of software pros very customizable interface making the phone very user friendly you can set any application or any number to dial as a preset button palm os is easy to use and thus you actually get to take advantage of the many features of the phone unlike windows mobile which is definantly more powerful than palm os but cumbersome and difficult to use at times you can use this as a one handed phone very important for people like me who like to drive and text email perfect size weight and feel of the phone in your hand and on your ear the lack of the antennae stub on this model is a huge aesthetic improvement easy synchronization with your outlook mailbox or with the palm desktop can set the phone to automatically retrieve your emails and alert you which is very useful although limits battery life cons battery life is somewhat worse than other phones i have to charge my phone every night and i probably use about minutes of internet minutes of player autoretrieve email every min and hour talk time as well as some other palm functions if you have it set on auto retrieve for your email the battery life seems to decrease impressively the newer manufactured have a fix installed for this problem apparently you cant plug in your own headsets into the device like your ipod headphones you have to use a specific headphone that fits and you can get it from palm i hate that i suggest buying this phone unlocked from palm instead of from cingular i got it for with a sd card and stereo headphones included also if you get it from cingular they always ruin the look of the phone by plastering their logo all over both sides of the phone overall extremely satisfied with this easy to use highly customizable powerful smartphone despite a somewhat shorter battery life
0,this little machine is not worth the cost of the plastic to make it i assumed since wahl has a long time history of manufacturing grooming products that this would be a quality item was i ever wrong this trimmer is constructed poorly and doesn t cut hair it will be heading to the trash

0,went to see this movie at the imax in san antonio this weekend i have to say i actually laughed most of the way through the effects were decent but most of the time i had trouble making anything out due to the fuzzy effects that was when i wasn t having to look around the bird statues and gargoyles that popped up in the foreground of the shot in blazing white about six inches from my face making it completely impossible to focus on the actual movie some of the torture scenes and the faustian plotline along with the hideous firey face that is mr d make this movie too dark and scary for anyone under the age of but the terrible plot along with the worst voice acting i have had the displeasure to hear in my life make the film unbearable for anyone over the age of basically i guess you could say i was slightly displeased with the movie i do have to admit that i got a hearty laugh when the main character johnny played by jasper steverlinck an up and coming rocker and lead singer of the band arid a decent rock group that was featured at the end of the movie in the only bright spot i could find in the movie throws his guitar into the fire and begins singing opera to defeat the evil mr d and destroy the haunted castle unfortunately the scene was designed to be serious

1,our baby was born in early october and we put the bundleme on her carrier immediately we live in chicago and have had warm weather degrees and cold weather below since then we love this cover the top easily zips off for those rare warm days or if we are strolling though the mall it also has kept her very warm and toasty on cold windy days the day when it was below freezing she was zipped up in the cover with only a winter hat on and your typical outfit i was concerned for her warmth but when we unzipped her she was as toasty warm as could be we have not had to buy a winter jacket it has also kept her dry through a couple of rain storms i have gotten numerous compliments on this cover almost every time we take her out and it still looks like new even though many things have gotten spilled on it i would highly recommend this product

1,we got this chair as a baby shower gift which i registered for and absolutely love it i don t understand the problems the other reviewers are talking about if used properly this chair gives absolutely no problems the seat locks in at different levels if it s not locked in of course it will fall apart the seat is easy to use folds easily and cleans easily we store it in our van we have stow and go storage and it fits perfectly we ve used it since my son now months could sit up he lays his body from side to side and the seat doesn t budge very safe the tray does snap off easily and he has done that at times while trying to climb up on it this doesn t bother me since it s not a toy and shouldn t be climbed on anyway the tray hasn t snapped off while in use and hopefully won t we ve used this chair on both a chair and the floor when seating was limited like at family get togethers we haven t had any problems at all anyway i highly recommend it
1,images from this camera are very high quality the optical zoom is very usable with only minimal distortion noticeable at the extremes the optical image stabilization system based on stabilizing the ccd image sensor instead of lens elements is quite good and performed well under several different circumstances moving car boat shaky hands my main gripe with this camera is the lack of high speed usb support the fine print says that the usb interface is full speed which means a maximum transfer rate of mbit s instead of the mbit s possible with high speed usb so downloading photos from the camera through the usb interface is painfully slow compared to most current generation digital cameras such as a canon the software provided with the camera is somewhat difficult to use and is slow and unresponsive it would also be desirable if the camera could accept a lithium ion rechargeable battery in addition or instead of the aa batteries it uses but battery life with both alkaline and rechargeable nimh aa batteries was adequate
1,great price free shipping basically i love it i placed my order on sunday and got it a m tuesday morning i highly recommend this seller i will definitely continue to buy from this seller myself
